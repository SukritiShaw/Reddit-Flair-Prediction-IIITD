USA just threatened India with retaliation after we spent 100 crores for the Orange man. Kaka calls him his *phrand*, showers him with praise, I don't see any friendship with the Orange man"," Modi has Stockholm syndrome To be fair, the evidence that chloroquine works is anecdotal and not scientifically proven. The entire Story has emerged from some right wing corner in the US. A Trump supporting couple self prescribed themselves chloroquine after Trump described it as a 'miracle'. The man died and the woman was admitted to intensive care.

1,AskIndia,"Randians who were big time users of dating apps like Tinder, Bumble once, what made you stop using them?",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fizkkk/randians_who_were_big_time_users_of_dating_apps/,"I'd my own stint with these apps(a couple of months) and then at one point it just didn't feel right. What's your story?    

P.S - The `AskIndia` flair ain't working mods."," Someone matched with me just to tell me that I'm fat. Cat 1:- General ""Follow me"" influencers + Bots, nearly same thing.

Cat 2:- Girls looking out for validation atmost.

Cat 3:- Looking out for true love on Tinder or maybe comfortable future, who knows. Doesn't know any good man in thirsty as fuck society like ours.

Cat 4:- Past-the-wall Aunties. Too cumbersome to filter out + prefer foreigners, I don't blame them. Lack of matches I used Tinder on and off when I was in India, Bumble not so much. Went out on 3-4 dates and matched with decent number of women. This is over 2 years so no achievement.

I don't use them now. Reason being that I feel that most women over there are just killing time. And I can understand why. In a country like India where the dating scene is quite imbalanced women don't need apps to go out on dates. Especially when India isn't a safe country for women too. 

Not to mention if you're an average looking guy the odds aren't in your favour. So I have to make conversations with so many women which don't go anywhere and it just gets tiring. Most of the times it is obvious that the girls never had an intention of meeting.

Also I feel that dating apps usually attract lazy people. I am myself lazy and I don't have the energy to go out and socialize and try meeting women. So I try to swipe left and write sitting on my sofa in the hope of getting a date. I feel the same applies to women. The girls on Tinder, more often than not are too lazy, undecided or uninterested in taking any action. I had used Tinder in US for only 2-3 days while on a trip, got good matches. Not a single match in India in 2-3 years. I don't use it regularly though, one or two times in a couple of months.

And Indian Tinder is filled with fake profiles and who-knows-what-they-think pictures (at least in my location), I have to swipe left on like 10 profiles to come across 1 genuine profile, and still no match! Is it just me who read the first word wrongly ? -What made me stop ?


-Marriage I don't know. People aren't 'real' on there. Girls hide 75% of their face/body and when you meet them it's like ""Woah who tf are you?"". Most girls just want to feel better that someone prefers them. I haven’t stopped, I just use it less often these days cause work is mad hectic right now.

Bumble and hinge work well for me. Tinder is shit, it’s pretty much become pay to use/get seen ( at least for dudes)."

Hello,

Last year I took a Term policy from ICICI Prudential. I took this policy with the intention of ""Insurance"" rather than ""Investment"".

So as per this policy: 1) I will be paying Rs. 14000~ for 30 years. The Sum Assured is Rs. 325000.

2) At the end of Premium Paying term, company will pay Sum Assured, plus revisionary and terminal bonuses if any.

3) If I die within Premium paying term (30 yrs), company will pay ""twice"" the Sum assured, plus revisionary and terminal bonuses if any.

4) If I die after the Premium paying term or if I turn 100, company will pay the Sum assured (without revisionary and bonuses).

Questions:

1) The Sum assured is less than the total premium I ll pay. Is it normal for a Term policy?

2) If I die during Premium paying term, are the returns sufficient in comparison to the amount I pay?

3) Points 4 and 2 seems to be confusing. Are they going to pay me twice?

Please help clarify, as this is my first policy. :)

6,AskIndia,"Ambassador of India takes back my newly issued OCI card, suggests a pay for and fill out new application. Please advise.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bdfid1/ambassador_of_india_takes_back_my_newly_issued/,"Hello /AskIndia!  First time poster, long time lurker here.

&#x200B;

Brief background: My wife is Indian and I am Canadian, and we have been so excited to finally visit her family in India this summer. I applied for the OCI 11 months ago per her request to make it happen. The application never went smooth, but that was never expected, as goes this story for most OCI applicants. We properly submitted all our documents, and each month like clockwork, we receive additional requests from the Indian Embassy for ""extra"" documents that weren't requisites on the OCI application checklist. We happily oblige to all requests with exceptional punctuality, no questions, just documents. 11 months go by since we submitted everything, and finally we get notified that my OCI card was ready for pick up at the Indian Embassy. Just come with your passport so we can take fingerprints and you can be on your way to India!

We drive 7 hours to the Embassy, getting pumped up to an audiobook set in India (yes, we're nerds) . When we finally get to the Embassy, we sit down with our consulur,  who strangely didn't greet or make eye contact for the first few minutes of our meeting.  She hands me my OCI Card, its receipt, and asks my wife to sign document a declaring that she agrees to forfeit my OCI card to the Government of India in case of my death or divorce.

However, things got strange when the consular went on her computer and said that the electronic fingerprint software wouldn't open up specifically for my OCI file.  She stands up, picks up my passport and brand new OCI card, leaves her office to meet with the Embassy's  Ambassador and only returns with my Canadian passport, not my OCI. She said the Ambassador is in a bad mood and suggests that I  fill out and pay for new application.

Excuse me, what? I've never seen or met the ambassador. What is happening?

She explains that my OCI file number could not be retrieved in the system because the application was submitted in 2018, and because it's currently 2019, there were ""crossed wires"", thus resulting in their inability to take my fingerprints and give me my OCI.  My wife and I make the suggestion of taking physical ink fingerprints at the local police station and  bringing them back to the Embassy, so they can have a hard copy. She said that the ink fingerprint option is not possible and reiterates that the best solution, as per the advice of the ambassador who wasn't in a good mood, would be to fill out and pay for a new application. Back to square one, 11 months down the drain. We are confused, just drove 7 hours at her request to pick up this card only to tell us to our face that we can't have it and we need to start again.  We politely try to press her for more information, and the best option she has for us  was for her to email a request to her OCI contacts in India to try to resolve this by issuing a new file number and a new card, but not to be optimistic.

What is going on here? Any advice would be much appreciated.

I  should also add that I am Canadian living in Europe, a qualified  professional in ""interaction design"", educated, and don't have a criminal record."," Honestly, she and her supervisor behaved *exactly* how most of our government officers behave with residents of India. Inside India, they typically do such things to extract a bribe. I can't say for sure if she has the same expectation.

&#x200B;

One option you have - if OCI matters so much to you - is to tweet your problem directly to India's Foreign Minister, Sushma Swaraj. She is supposed to be proactive about such things, especially when it comes to matters like these where they like to project a good (but false) image of our government, and tweeting to her in front of millions of followers basically forces her hand into helping you. Also, pulling strings this way by bringing in somebody influential to get what you want is very much the Indian way, and since you wish to become a quasi-citizen of India, you might as well start learning our bad habits.

&#x200B;

I, personally, am not a big fan of kowtowing to influential people or to our government officials. I wouldn't have gone for an OCI to begin with, and if I absolutely had to for some reason, I'd try it once and drop the idea once it turned out to be too hard. You have already sunk enough costs for a card that is of little benefit. I suggest dropping the idea entirely. As a Canadian, I don't think you'll have any trouble getting multiple entry tourist visa for frequent visits. This lady sounds full of shit. Why would an ambassador concern himself/herself with OCI affairs? 

Even if she isn’t lying, it’s worth emailing the consulate/embassy politely explaining the situation and cc-ing the ambassador if you can find their email. If there are multiple consular missions in the country, try emailing them as well. Tweet a summary with some details to Sushma Swaraj , she has helped ppl in similar situations Hi, I'm sorry to hear that you had to go through this. You'd think these people would adapt to the local work culture/ethic but it seems they are pushing their work culture and ethic on the locals, which shouldn't be the case.

&#x200B;

Please tweet your issue to the minister of external affairs:  [https://twitter.com/SushmaSwaraj?ref\_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor](https://twitter.com/SushmaSwaraj?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) 

&#x200B;

make sure it's public and that her twitter is tagged in your post. She is very well known to bring visa officers in line when they refuse to carry out their duty. Do keep us posted about things you did for this issue. If it is just for a visit, apply for a regular visa. You can always visit India as a tourist. As regards your OCI card application, tweet or send a message to the External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj with your experience. probably you are lying in fine details, or it is shitpost or karma whoring.

as an official, one can certainly say that - an ambassador is too busy to deal with  ""We drive 7 hours to the Embassy, getting pumped up to an audiobook set in India (yes, we're nerds)"" r/iamverysmart individuals.  
moreover, if any of the official encounters technical problems - it is impossible for them to say ""cannot be done because of bad mood"".

12,AskIndia,"What happened to the ""spiritual country"" that India used to be?",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ai7392/what_happened_to_the_spiritual_country_that_india/,"So I do not know whether to put this in Ask India (because it is a question) or Reddiquette (because it is a discussion in and of itself). But I wanted to discuss this with someone, *anyone.*  

So ours is (used to be?) a spiritual country. Off the top of my head, I can recall at least 4 major religions that began here: Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism. Who knows, there are probably more that I don't know about. And at the core of these religions (irrespective of how the religions' followers have interpreted things) these religions are supposed to be about GOOD. About being nice, kind, compassionate, loving, forgiving.  

The prevalent view in India about the west and people from western countries is that those guys are ""materialistic"" and we are somehow more ""spiritualistic"". I couldn't disagree more.  

Rather, I see the values and virtues of simple kindness, love, nicety, acceptance, love and certain other so-called ""spiritual"" virtues on the rise far more amongst the western world than in India. It is not like people are rising up in arms against ideas such as racism, sexism and homophobia for no reason in the west. Indians, meanwhile, are still dealing with the Supreme Court ruling legaylising gay relationships. While kids in the western worlds are growing up being more accepting of kids from a different economical background than theirs, or someone who has gay/lesbian parents, or someone who has anxiety issues or what-have-you; we in India are drumming up noise about what ""ancient India"" achieved in terms of scientific advances and how ""our Indian culture"" is above all and everyone else is somehow beneath us.  

Now don't get me wrong here - I am NOT trying to say that ""the west is perfect and that all Indians are all dicks"" or anything like that. Indians (outside of the major metroes) are still some of the most kind and helpful people that I've met - so long as you don't discuss things that will piss them off e.g. religion, caste system etc. And yes, the west has a LONG way to go before they become all accepting, just look at the MAGA crowd and the whole feminist cult. But that having been said, I really wonder why we as a country are not waking up to the fact that we are becoming ""evil"" day by day (ironically, while attempting to tell the world how ""good and virtuous our *ancient civilization* is"") while the one's we have *vilified* as the ""ignorant western people"" are slowly leaving us behind; much like the tortoise in the tortoise/hare story.  

Just a little something for everyone to think about on a regular Monday morning. Cheers.  

**EDIT:** And it is surprising that while so many WhatsApp forwards talk about how India had the best *""Vimanas""* (spacecrafts) or the best *""Brahmastras""* (weapons equivalent to a nuke); nobody, like LITERALLY NOT ONE SINGLE WHATSAPP ""FORWARD"" talks about how *humility, kindness, forgiveness, acceptance etc.* were the (supposed) virtues of people from that time period. Perhaps promoting such virtues in our current world is not seen as ""cool"" enough by the people who forward these forwards? I dunno. But it fails me how having a *personal flying ship* is somehow more important than basic love and kindness towards one another."," It all starts with the relationships we have with our families, the education we get and the amount of time we join our brethren in discussions/reflections on life.  
Having a healthy appreciation for the achievements of our ancestors and using them as an inspiration to work towards a progressive future would be a great way forward. India is a ritualistic country, has always been. Spiritual places/people do exist in himalayas, varanasi, arunachal ashrams etc. and they still in full glory. Your position is too simplistic. It’s the kind of logic one would see on a meme. 

First of all, this idea of claiming certain traits is not unique to India. America claims ‘freedom’ for example. Some Japanese have tried to argue how the Japanese outlook on beauty is different than that of the rest of the world. The Germans claim ‘industriousness,’ the Chinese ‘stability and order’ and so on. These are ideals, but not defensible under a court of law. 

Nobody should be tallying up points to prove or disprove any of these because it is a meaningless exercise, meant only to attack how a country sees itself — and it will win you no favours, however right you may be. 

Next, you don’t factor in how much of this ‘spirituality’ is a direct counter to western colonialism and market imperialism. Even a casual look at Indian history does not convince me that ‘spiritualism’ is a major feature of most kingdoms or empires in the subcontinent. Not that the Bhakti movement, the Sufi movement, the Virasaivites etc. did not exist, but that they were quite often not the defining feature of Indian politics or active life. 

Where you see the mystical India emerge is in British writing, and later Indian writers, politicians and reformers trying to separate India from Western civilization. As late as 1810, India accounted for nearly 25% of international trade and quite a lot of global gdp. I doubt spiritualism was at play here. 

Moreover, this talk of spiritualism is also often used to silence the active role Indians have played in history. It’s far easier to think of a quiet, backward and peaceful nation of mystics slipping behind the west because they focused on ‘spirituality’ and not on technology. The far more complicated truth is conveniently left out. 

And finally, is it all that ‘love and kindness’  in the west that has had them bomb every country between Saudi Arabia and India? Is it love that has allowed the US president to call Africa a continent of shithole countries and ban immigration from ‘muslim countries’? 

Even regarding social liberalization, is it love that made the US push abstinence only sex education and preach against the use of condoms in Africa during the HIV crisis? Is it kindness to continuously threaten to restrict access to abortion for women? Ban Burkinis? Call migrants fleeing terror and war ‘swarms’ as if they were pests? In the words of the Black Eyed Peas: “Where is the love?”

Your view is either myopic or bigoted, in that either you receive restricted and biased information or you are far more forgiving of ‘western’ countries than India. The truth, of course, is that India is also becoming more socially liberal. Only time will tell, once Indians are as wealthy as Americans what the social landscape in India will look like. Here’s the thing: In my lifetime I’ve only seen it get better. 

I don’t even defend this characterization of India as a ‘spiritual’ place. India is anything but spiritual for most Indians who actually live there. It’s the foreign ‘Eat-Pray-Love’ crowd, doing hot yoga and sipping Yerba mate tea who see India as this mystical place. Sort of like the Beatles. And India in response capitalized on it. To me, it is a foreign import. But if that’s what India wants for the future, I think they can go for it. 

Again, I don’t think for one minute India is a better place for the average trans person than the US today, but you imply that by virtue of spiritualism and kindness and love, we should be, and that’s just wrong.  Religion existed as means to control societies. It kept people within tribal groups. Gave them a code of behaviour and roles to play. It made sure the oppressed never questioned why they were opppressed and the weak to be happy with their lot with hope for future rewards. Plus it helped explain phenomenon they did not understand. Now we understand almost everything and can come up with scientific and logical explanation for most phenomenon. We follow rule of law and secular philosophy rather than religion to dictate our morals. We don't need religion really. Now it's only a crutch for the weak minded and people who are in a bad position in life.  Spiritualism was once indeed an aspect of Indian culture. That generation is long gone. Today, spiritualism in the Indian context is more of a feelgood consolation prize (hey we might be losers, but we are ""spiritual""). In reality, we have become way more worldly and materialistic than some Western societies. Bc khaane ko paise nahi, rehne ko room nahi, peene ko daaru nahi, aur babu rao ko sukoon nahi. Aur tum sprituality ki baatan karte. Religious and materialistic are not opposites of each other like you make it sound. Religious texts and behavior is the singlemost biggest reason for people being homophobic,sexist etc. these texts outline what sexuality is right and what is not,what a girl or a boy is supposed to do and what not. If only people can think and have empathy on their own without needing random holy texts,we wouldn't have so many problems in the first place  Communal politics.  Its an irrelevant comparison as you are not taking country-specific factors into account:

1) The West is economically developed vs India and has at least 30 years of a headstart. Any society will automatically try to cure itself of its evils once your basic amenities and infra are taken care of.

2) No other country is as diverse as India - religion, language, food, culture, race, caste. You name it and India has it. Now I have nothing against diversity, but from a social perspective, it does put us at a disadvantage as politicians can continue to target specific vote banks without focusing on economic development. Consequently, when there is no economic progress, social progress is hard to achieve.

3) You might underplay the importance of gay sex legalization, but there has been a real change in mindset, at least in the urban areas. This is tangible social progress and it was unimaginable 20-30 years back. Even when you look at the USA, not every state has legalized gay marriage.

Btw, what is your definition of evil? The average middle class in India have always been like this. The spiritual India that you're talking about, existed in  ""Ramayan"" and ""Mahabharata"". I didn’t find what was the specific question though LOL, spiritual country my foot! Let me quote myself that I've written elsewhere, albeit bit edited. This was specific to issue of legalization of weed but, overall I think I got the point across.

13,AskIndia,Clueless American: Food Etiquette with our Indian Neighbors,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bemcxg/clueless_american_food_etiquette_with_our_indian/,"I'd initially posted this to r/AskIndia and got some advice, but I was also directed to post this here too. My main goal is to avoid any inadvertent rudeness on our family's part. 

 

So we have some neighbors from India (we're in the U.S.) and they have a daughter around the same age as ours (preschool). The two girls have become good friends and play together several times a week. Whenever their daughter comes over to our house, she brings a snack with her, and politely declines anything we offer her while she's here (they're Catholic, and do not have any dietary restrictions from what they've told us) which is usually fruit or crackers, never junk food. Whenever our daughter goes over to their house, she ALWAYS comes back with food of some sort. Sometimes its a small snack, sometimes its something more elaborate. They've also brought us food on a couple occasions too (always delicious). We've had them over for a meal a few times, and they eat sparingly.

&#x200B;

My impression is that they just don't enjoy Western food, which is completely fine. But I want to make sure we're not somehow being rude. Growing up, if I went over to a friend's house, their parents would give us snacks/drinks. Similarly, if friends came over to my house, my parents would offer food/drinks. But should we be sending our daughter over to their house with her own snack? When we cook something special, should we bring some to them? I just want to make sure we're being good/considerate friends."," You can directly ask them if it would be ok to offer their kid some food and if it is what things need to be considered, like any allergies, etc.

Also, their not eating much might be their food preferences(might not like weatern food) or maybe they're shy ( Many Indians are shy when they are eating at someone who's not close) I don't have an answer to your question, but I just wanted to say thanks for making the effort to learn and understand a new/different culture. If everyone was like you, the world would be an amazing place! I've been living in the US for nearly two years now (Indian national), and I can see some similarities with my upbringing.

First, their kid bringing snacks to eat at your house is kind of weird, but not really.
Indians have this whole thing where they tend to refuse something that is offered to them once or twice, even if they want it. But it's way more simpler with Americans. If you're eating a bag of chips and offer some to an American, they'll take it if they want it, or refuse. But if you offer some to an Indian, they might refuse the first time. This means that they are waiting on you to offer it once again, so they know that you really meant it when you offered it, and you're not just offering it for the sake of doing so.
This explains how they send food over with your daughter, but eat sparingly when they're over for dinner at your house. They probably refuse seconds because of this.

Its definitely not something you're doing wrong. It's just the way we are wired. If they didn't like you or were offended they would interact with you or your family that much.

The next time they refuse food, just plop some on their plate regardless and see if they'll eat it or leave it on the plate (this is how Indian aunties torture you lol) >My impression is that they just don't enjoy Western food, which is completely fine. 

Quite likely. What snacks does their daughter come with? If it's a Western snack, then you can certainly bring it up with her parents. In India, it's considered quite rude to go to somebody's house and not eat at least a little of what they are offering you.

Having said that, you don't want to be pushy. The main thing is both your kids are building the friendship so just go with the flow.

The real issue is that they don't like Western food so even if you cook something special and bring it to them, they may be forced to accept it out of politeness but it would likely go to waste. They'll be more than happy to feed your child when she is over there so don't over-think it. They are probably happy their daughter has found somebody close-by she can be friends with. So, just relax and enjoy the friendship. I dont think that they dont enjoy western food.I think this is partially a cultural thing, part of being a good guest is to make sure your host isnt going to be troubled. Indians have this in common with Iranian people, it is considered polite to refuse the first couple of times, unless the host insists. If their daughter not eating the snacks you offer is troubling you, politely insist, they might usually take it after a couple of tries, or leave it out and let them help themselves. 

Eating sparingly is also considered good manners, rather than eating till fit to burst. Exchanging food and snacks is a common way of showing friendship. So taking food over to their house would be a nice gesture. I dont think you need to send your daughter with her own snack. I honestly don't know about why the neighbors daughter is bringing her own snacks and is not eating what you all offer. It is probably the things that others have said, that she prefers Indian snacks.

Regarding the neighbors eating sparingly when they're over at your place for dinner I have an alternate theory which might be true. often Indians eat dinner very late at night, maybe even after 10 p.m. if that is the case with your neighbors then if you offered them dinner at 7 p.m. they might just not be that hungry, and hence eating sparingly. You're overthinking this way too much. Cheeseburger next time plz It's a part of our culture (at least Bengali culture) to bring food when we visit any neighbour or relatives. I've seen it from a very young age and I'm used to with it. I think you are over thinking it. They won't mind.

  


I also have family in US (Houston, Texas) and they have told me that American food sucks so maybe that's why she doesn't like that. It's alright :) that moment of realisation that American food sucks really bad!"
14,AskIndia,What is 'Gotra'?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a2nsgt/what_is_gotra/,"Hey, there's a term quite popular right now in news debate, of 'Gotra' and I don't know what it means, so can anyone tell me about it?
(Note: Actually I want to use 'AskIndia' flair also but couldn't do that as Reddit restricts flair to 1)"," In Hindu culture, the term gotra (Sanskrit: गोत्र) is commonly considered to be equivalent to clan. It broadly refers to people who are descendants in an unbroken male line from a common male ancestor or patriline. Generally the gotra forms an exogamous unit, with the marriage within the same gotra being prohibited by custom, being regarded as incest.[1] The name of the gotra can be used as a surname, but it is different from a surname and is strictly maintained because of its importance in marriages among Hindus, especially among the higher castes. Pāṇinidefines gotra for grammatical purposes as apatyam pautraprabhrti gotram (IV. 1. 162), which means ""the word gotra denotes the progeny (of a sage) beginning with the son's son."" When a person says ""I am Vipparla-gotra"", he means that he traces his descent from the ancient sage Vipparla by unbroken male descent.

According to the Brihadaranyaka Upanisad2.2.6, Gautama and Bharadvāja, Viśvāmitra and Jamadagni, Vashishtha and Kaśhyapa and Shandilya are seven sages (also known as saptarishi); the progeny of these seven sages are declared to be gotras. This enumeration of seven primary gotras seems to have been known to Pāṇini. The offspring (apatya) of these seven are gotras and others than these are called gotrâvayava.[2]

One who follows the system defined by three sages defines himself as tri-a-rishaye. Similarly, for five sages, it is pancha-rishaye, and for seven sages, it is sapta-rishaye.

There exists another theory about gotra: sons and disciples of a sage would have the same gotra; it is believed that they possess similar thought and philosophy. People of the same gotra can be found across different castes. Each Gotra comprises pravaras.

 Basically representing the ancestor.
e.g. Agrawals have 18 gotra based on the 18 son of Maharaj Agrasen.  Gotra basically tells you from which ancient sage your bloodline is descended from.

Gotra are very important to Brahmins. Other Hindu castes care lesser about it. Also you can use Gotra to tell from where a particular brahmin is from. That's how it was known Rahul Gandhi's gotra was from Kashmir.

Source: A Brahmin. There is agricultural metaphor behind gotra 'logic':

&#x200B;

*Indian farmers often draw  comparisons between agricultural and human reproductive  processes, as when they compare a fertile soil with a womb,  the seed with semen, sowing with copulation, harvesting with  the severance of birth and the happiness it brings, and  the barren lands with the post-partum period or, at times, with female widowhood. This reproductive view of agriculture is not unique to India, but is found elsewhere in human societies.*

>Men give the seed which encapsulates the potential child. A woman's body, like soil, provides the nurturant context for the foetus. This was graphically stated by another Turkish villager: If you plant wheat, you get wheat. If you plant barley, you get barley. It is the seed which determines the kind of plant which will grow, while the field nourishes the plant but does not determine the kind. The man gives the seed, and the woman is like the field (Meeker 1970: 157). The nurture that women provide-blood in the womb and milk at the breast-can be supplied by any woman. This nourishment swells the being of the seed-child and while it affects the growth and development of the child, it does not affect its essential identity; that comes from the father. Women's nurturing capacity is valued, but it must also be remarked that the substance they provide ultimately derives from men since men are thought to engender both males and females.  
>  
>  
>  
>The substance women contribute pertains only to this world-it is perishable and does not carry the eternal identity of a person. The child originates with the father, from his seed. This is the basis for what I call a 'monogenetic' theory of procreation.

16,AskIndia,European looking for opinions from Indians regarding how to make a difficult relationship work,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/968di3/european_looking_for_opinions_from_indians/,"Namaste Redditors, (also posted to AskIndia but I am in need right now)

I am from Central Europe and in a 1.5year relationship with an Indian woman. Without going into too much detail, we are pretty sure that we fit very well together, but the problem is that she is from a very traditional family (arranged in-caste marriage) who she loves and is loved by.

Understandably, she does not want to 

1. Hurt her family's standings
2. Cause her family grief and pain
3. Basically get shunned and exiled from her family.

I can secure her a safe, free life (be it in India or in Europe) with a near-guarantee of a loving, supportive husband. 

I want to make this happen, but knowing that she would never hurt her family like that, meaning she will ultimately marry another guy, I feel conflicted as to whether this relationship should go on.

I would appreciate any opinions on this. Especially from people who have been in that situation or who know what other ways are there for us to be together without hurting the family and its standings.

Thank you very much for reading and commenting. "," Hate to break this to you buddy, but you are the third wheel.

The sooner you get out, the better it is for you.

I would suggest a show down as soon as it is possible. Ask her to talk to her parents and choose between you and her family asap. My guess is that she will choose the family. From what I gather her parents haven't even started pressuring her and she is already starting to break. Indian parents have a long list of arsenal at their disposal. Get your parents to meet her parents and fix the union.  [deleted] I've thought of doing this but haven't had to - Ask her to pretend to show interest in other women in front of her parents. And then eventually bring you into the picture. 

If there is anything Indian parents are more afraid of than inter caste marriage, it's homosexuality! 😁 Take the initiative. The kind of description you've given, I think this approach might work. Your girl clearly has no spine to stand up for you. Get her dad on your side, how, use money and respect. Address him as sir, be very respectable, go as far as promising to convert to whatever religion/cast he wants. Tell him you'll give her a good life. That could work, or at least will soften him.

Now man to man, I wouldn't advice going for a girl who can't stand up to her family, you may somehow marry her today, but her family will be a cause for grief all your life, because there will always be something with them.

Don't know all the details though, good luck! Welcome to casteism,OP. Try watching Bride and Prejudice for help. Same situation, except the girl told them that this is how she will love and that she will always love/respect/etc them, but she will choose the person she marries (me). Everyone also told me to 'forget it' and 'prepare for the worst', but she came through. All you can do is support her and make her aware of the tactics/ploys which her family will employ to psychologically browbeat her into submission. And by no means should you consider yourself any less. It'll be difficult at first but afterwards, you'll laugh about it.  In my experience, the only way these types of relationships work is if the Indian involved is strong enough to stand up for him/herself to their parents, ALONE.  In other words, ultimately the fight is between her and the parents - not you.  Even if you offer her all the support in the world, if she cannot in her heart fully commit to you and is inching closer to her parents' influence, then I don't think it is worth marrying her.  Think about it.  What if down the line, when you are long married, her parents keep interfering in her life and won't stop? And if you have kids, they will insist on raising them this/that way and may continue to haggle her over it. They will emotionally blackmail (Indian parents are unfortunately masters at this) until they get their way.  Point is, if she has problems drawing clear boundaries now, it will make your life HELLISH in the future.  No matter how strong a husband you think you are, a marriage is ultimately a two person deal and 'saving' her will only lead to heartbreak and psychologically scarred children.  Sorry to put it bluntly like that but I feel it's the truth.

The responsible thing, I think, is to really have her come clean on how strongly she wants to work things out with you, versus obey her parents.  Have an honest sit-down with her and push her into really answering objectively. If she is wishy-washy, tell her that you will have to leave her- because it shows that she is unwilling to face and meet the real consequences of her actions.  I know that relationships are rarely black and white in terms of how you feel for each other, and are often very gray - but real world consequences ARE black and white, with very real specific physical/mental/emotional results - that is why you have to get firm with her.  SHE is the one who will have to fight - and if keeping the family status-quo is more important to her, she won't have the strength to do so. 

No matter what happens, DON'T let your feelings for her propel you to 'save' her and be her champion.  It's almost sure to end badly for you, her, and everybody.  It may be painful to break up, but that pain will be nothing compared to what you will save yourself if you don't.  

So good luck, and remember- let it be up to her. There’s a reason you hardly ever see Indian women with non India guys.  
You just run smack into it. 

She’s just like the majority.

(Most) Indian women simply don’t do foreign guys be it tradition, family, culture.....

Unlike any other culture marriage in India  is an utterly unique, special, watershed event. I’m sure you know this thou. Are you sure that she's with you because she loves you or is she with you because, in a way, you're 'exotic' for her? Well I would suggest that you meet up with her family in some other pretext and get a sense about them. In many cases I have seen, Indian girls are way too scared to talk to their parents like mature adults and perceive things more severely. I would also suggest that you should ask her to identify a person close to her parents whom she can trust. That person can put in a good word to make things easier.
On a lighter note: Watch Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, it's a similar situation (to some extent). Understandably, she does not want to

Hurt her family's standings
Cause her family grief and pain
Basically get shunned and exiled from her family.... 


The ball is in her court. She needs to think independently and get this sorted. 

On the other hand,  I hope she loves you truly and not just because you're from a European country or for financial independence. You need to make this very clear. 

Please think twice before you proceed. 
Some Indian women are too emotional and tend to be escapist. 

Her parents would constantly belittle her for going  against them and this might  take a toll on your relationship in the near future. I'm also a  minor victim of this. 

 grandkids have fixed some of the relationships. your mileage may vary. Well I am late here. But all the best OP!

I hope your woman has the courage to stand up for you. 

In the end the family wants a genuine guy with a decent income and stable life ( I am sorry but that's how they work in India) and if they give you the chance to talk and you can convince them, there are possibilities. 

This would be a harsh test of her character and your patience, but I hope you guys come through. Please keep us updated  Move on and break up with her . Help info : where s her family located  ? What is her caste ? If she not willing to STAND UP TO HER PARENTS!!! LET IT GO

**[ASK] - AskIndia**  
  
These are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  
  
If the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  
  
**Science & Technology** 

This flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   
 
If Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  
If the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  

**Policy & Economy**
  
These flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  

**Business & Finance**  

These flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  
  
**Entertainment** 

Entertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  
  
This flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   
 
**Sports and Food** 

Sports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  

**AMA**
  
AMA flairs are given to OPs who verify their identity with the mod team. In case they choose not to verify, they will get an **Unverified** flair.  
  
**In-Depth**

This flair must be used carefully.This flair *only* used when you need an In-depth discussion about the topic. Top comments must have a proper explanation/discussion about the top. Top comments must fulfil the word limit else the comment **will** get deleted by all mighty automod.

PS - In the event of confusion, just go for Reddiquette.
  
Recommendations for new flairs may be made below.  "," Can we have an Education/Career related flair?

Edit: And a Shitpost flair(for threads related to jokes, memes, roasts). How about a **META** flair to discuss about the policies and the discussions related to the subreddit? We need daily sax thread flair Help! My posts are not showing up on r/india/new after I post them.  I don't know if this has been discussed before but can we have a self help flair as well?  Does this mean the end of the Demonitization flair as it is not mentioned in OP? 

How about a ""News"" flair for topics a day or two old? And a ""Programming"" flair given the number of techies on randia and the lack of programming content?  Oh shit, late for the party...

I have been wanting to request this for sometime.

Can we have a Environment / nature flair (where in we can discuss things like the water shortage in the southern states, Air pollution in Delhi and surrounding areas, drought etc).  We understand but please make the flairing bot better and less annoying. Atleast give us the option to delete the comment after we have rightly flaired. What flair should be used for jokes and dank memes about political topics ? I think we need a Humour flair. [deleted] If the post is about corruption in Railways (not ministry), what flair should it have? We need a satire flair. The some of the fakingnews articles really are believable.  Can I express an obvious request? For posts which have been upvoted and have a discussion going - can the Mods simply rename the Flair instead of deleting the thread, in case they think the flair is inappropriate?  Jingoism flair ? What happened to the scheduled flair which we had for SC/ST users?  I recommend a flair for Defense and National Security - the few posts I shared on these topics were flaired Political.

Also, I have a question if Defence Research and Tech posts which can also involve weapons and platform tests, and discussion should be flaired SciTech or the ~~above post~~ above Defence flair ? Can we have a `Crime` flair? [deleted] We need DST. Long time pending! We need a shitpost flair guys You missed **In-Depth** the flair which makes auto-mod delete all the comments. Just so guys know, almost everything can be political.  can we have randia flair? [removed] But we can't end flair on app.
I wanted to post yesterday,but couldn't  What about posts about other countries' policies which affect India (eg the H1B thing, comments from Pak, etc)?
Should it be policy/economy? Or is there like a geopolitics flair? >Reddiquette

finally Can we have something called **Show-India** ?

Many people can show the new things they built !! There will invariably be topics that don't belong to any set flair, or belong to many.

Create a ""Miscellaneous"" flair, or maybe show some flexibility. We need analytics on which flair used most and least etc. Some insights please Just make these flairs OPTIONAL & don't autodelete posts when someone forgets to flair them. Let us have an **[OC]** flair to encourage the sharing of Original Content. Not sure if this has been asked before.. how do I add a flair via the Android app? Please enlighten. Add a flair for rape news. Please enable the rage faces, they were fun to use. [](/hehheh) Yes we really need to talk about life changing transcending flairs that changed the course of our lives...

19,AskIndia,Who should I vote for in 2019 General Elections?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/63l6vm/who_should_i_vote_for_in_2019_general_elections/,"Even though I was eligible to vote back in 2014, I was out-of-station during the elections and couldn't be back home in time to vote. I have never voted till now due to similar circumstances. 

Back when UPA I and II were in power, the obvious choice was BJP or its allies. But now that their true colours and agenda are out, my conscience wouldn't allow me to vote for them.

AAP is out of the question as Kejriwal has demonstrated his greed and hunger for power again and again. He keeps allying himself with all the wrong parties in order to protest against whichever the incumbent is.

I will never vote for INC until they change their top leadership and overhaul the party structure as a pro-development secular party with centrist policies.

Who do I vote for?

BJP will win in 2019 no matter what. I just don't want my vote to go to them. 

Are there any good candidate/parties that are not affiliated to the Sangh Parivar/RSS/VHP?

If this trend of right wing Nationalism continues, we'll turn into a Right Wing authoritarian Fascist pseudo-state. 

I wish to see India as an educated, liberal and inclusive country that keeps religion out of its government.


**EDIT:** *Should I flair it under Politics or AskIndia?*"," Founders of Indian democracy did not create a model where you vote for a party or the PM candidate. Just because you like Modi/Raga/Kejriwal does not mean all candidates of the respective parties are good. What most people don't realize is by voting for a 'PM' candidate, they are actually destroying the spirit of democracy. 

For general elections, research local candidates all of parties. Find a candidate who is honest, hardworking and has a history of doing good work and raising issues that matter to you. If you blindly vote for a party because you support their PM candidate then you may get a local MP who is useless and will not contribute anything in development on your region. 

EDIT: Typo > BJP will win in 2019 no matter what. I just don't want my vote to go to them.





NOTA. Look at your MP candidates and vote for the best one irrespective of their party... [deleted] Simply don't vote. The current version of NOTA is a joke on us. So not voting is the better option. Doesn't matter    

#EVM ==> Every Vote for Modi NOTA. I know it is useless, but I have to register my dissatisfaction with the quality of options given to us. Ask after 2 years.  I'm voting for AAP because I want to see what that insane man does. India has survived 60 years of Congress and nearly 3 years of BJP. I'm sure it'll survive a Kejriwal.  > If this trend of right wing Nationalism continues, we'll turn into a Right Wing authoritarian Fascist pseudo-state.

u lost me here.  [deleted] For me, it's gonna be anything but BJP. They have become too arrogant. Do you have any regional parties prevalent in your state? I'm from Hyderabad so I guess I could vote for TRS. They've been doing great work.  Vote for Priyanka Gandhi if she is next PM candidate  I'll probably try AAP now I suppose. Tried INC -> Didn't work. Tried BJP -> They've done some good IMO, but as of now, they are super distracted. So the only party that is even trying is AAP, so I suppose that gets my vote.

Honestly the demographic dividend problem (and resource) is a very big one that can make or break the country's future. And nothing but a fully-focused push can achieve anything. Even then, it might be far too little , too late, but I'm always a hopeful man, so I'll still believe. But time is running very very low for things to be in place (as is India, we are already way past deadlines), but lets see what happens. [deleted] BJP , there simply isn't an alternative ! If you need to ask others who you should vote for, I think you are an uninformed voter and should refrain from voting. A better idea would be to make yourself informed and decide for yourself.

I personally will probably vote for INC, unless a better alternative comes up, but you should make your decision yourself."
20,AskIndia,"NEED HELP - People working in the IT Sector who have absconded a company in the past, can you please share your experience afterwards?",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9afobq/need_help_people_working_in_the_it_sector_who/,"I joined a MNC as a fresher with a 2 year bond of 1Lakh rs. Initial 6 months was training period after which we would have been put into projects. However, I had to join a project within a month immediately after my joining. I joined a project with QA (manual testing) profile and worked there for 6 months. During that time, I realized that if I continue there, I wouldn't have too much growth into the future. I was also put into support work as well which means I was doing both testing and support work. I researched a lot, made up my mind and called it quits. I left using a medical reason and didn't go back to work.

After that, I joined a small company as a Jr. Java Developer as a fresher again and have been working there for 1.7 years. I have successfully transitioned from a testing profile to a developer one and gave one hell of a performance as well (as much as a fresher can give).

Now, I am thinking of a job-switch and I am confused as to whether include the 6 months spent at the previous company as work-experience or not? I don't have a relieving letter/experience letter from them. I do have an offer letter, joining confirmation and two random pay-slips from them. Do I put that experience in my resume and be honest to the next company about my past (this is what I am bending towards), or do I hide the experience and just show my current experience as the total experience? Moreover, If I decide to hide it, will it come up in a background check?

I know it's a long post but I need some suggestions.(I have been all over internet and discussed with other peers but couldn't decide on a final thing). Any help will be much appreciated. Thanks.

PS: I posted this in r/AskIndia already but couldn't get many answers. Hope this post gains more attention this time."," Even though your post is very long, the job you are thinking of switching to is not mentioned properly. Do you already have a company (to switch to) in mind or just going to join wherever you get? 

In my opinion, I would suggest you to NOT mention that 6-month work thing anywhere on record. Try to convey your thoughts about those 6 months in your interview. At the end, it's all about what they think about you in the interview. If they think that your 6 months was productive, it doesn't matter whether you have a document or not. Though I did not abscond, I had a couple of rough exits from some companies, I told it to Wipro, they called the company which I worked for and truth was twisted.... and I lost the job offer from Wipro, the HR in Wipro told me, better dont show it, because no company wants an employee with a bad history Just be honest and upfront. Why hide?. 

Say I worked there, had excellent training and learnt a lot. Unfortunately, my project did not give me enough intellectual challenge and did not fit well in my career roadmap. Hence, after evaluating few options and keeping my manager and team in confidence, I decided to move on and take opportunity that would make me happy.

Why complicate things?. If the company that you are targeting gets bothered by that approach, you need to ask yourself, do you really want to work for them. 

I don't think anyone will have time to really digg into what happened in those 6 months, rather they will spend time assessing if you are good enough for the job. And will you have clear free mind answering questions constructively instead of having something back of your mind like what if they find, what should I tell etc etc."

Would love to hear from you guys. My notes on the original book are given below. Looking forward to your comments and suggestions and experiences and anything else you feel like talking about based on the summary/notes of the book I have provided below...

-------

""Letters To My Ex"" is a book by Nikita Singh, about a girl who runs away from her own engagement ceremony. She was supposed to be engaged and married to her own long time boyfriend but yet, she just freaked out and run away. She does not talk to anyone after that, and ten months in, she confesses to the boyfriend that she still loves him and makes him swear that he will do everything to earn her trust everyday henceforth.

I think it is a slightly less intellectual equivalent of ""Notes From The Underground"" (Men are Not Piano Keys) fame. The format is the same. Notes from the underground has notes, letters has letters. They are both viciously funny and about characters that are absolutely abominable.

Anyways, I started out writing my own response to the girl from the book and plan to publish it as a book of my own introducing concepts from neuroscience and philosophy and conflict resolution and the likes.

The original book is located here: 

https://www.amazon.in/Letters-My-Ex-Nikita-Singh-ebook/dp/B07938VDLS/ref=sr_1_2_twi_kin_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1535473766&sr=1-2&keywords=letters+to+my+ex

-----------------------------

These are my notes:

# On the Book

This books is about two people who met in college, were going to be married, but the woman ran away from the middle of the engagement ceremony and then they are again engaged.

As the author states, something essential connects them. This is very easy. They are connected by deformed ideas of love and a shared identity that they could not shed.

She panics because she does not discuss her problems and her idea of her future melts away right in front of her. And thereafter she does arbitrary things, does not communicate to anyone and when she meets her boyfriend and takes a look at him having moved on she falls in love with him again. And even he falls in love with her, again, because that desire motivates. And then he is self absorbed in his own way about her. And the girlfriend has no control over him. 

# January 
There's a lot of talk about the reactions she gets when she breaks off the marriage. Dad is confused, mom is angry and both of them are disappointed. Which brings in the next point. She is really, really confused at how she ended up being the disappointing one because she is not the one that disappoints, ever. Because she always behaved like the perfect daughter. And who is the perfect daughter? She does not know, she has an image in mind and she maintains it.

Then we get to see her first meet. What we realize is that she is reads a lot and she did not have time for appearances. She is a thinker. But she thinks a lot. Really. But does not have an internal discipline of truth maintenance. She falls in love with a legend. He is a cricketer. She has heard of him, and he cannot be controlled, can not be tamed, so she gets insecure around him and does not know how to behave. And she tries and dominate him, ""Do you like being ignored?""  Rolls her eyes!

And then there is the scene in which she breaks off her engagement. She runs away in the middle of it all because stress has been building up. And there after, she just starts thinking and feeling sad and keeping her thoughts to herself and being disappointed by life in general. She thinks that this is all turning out to be like other unhappy, sad, emotionless, married couples. And so the idea just freaks her out. And so she does not control and run away. Even in the middle of it, she wants him to come back to her, and run to save her. She is running away, but instead of thinking what she has done to him, she really wants him to come get her back. So. How. How in the world is it possible?

# February 
From a lot of the discussion it is somewhat apparent that she resented the involvement of her family into her life. There is some psychological projection involved as well. Their families are trying to conduct the affairs the way that they know is best. But after all this involvement, Needhi realizes this is not what she had in her mind. Which is to say, she had an idyllic vision of marriage in her head and the world just did not figure into that. So when that image broke, she did not understand what to do about it. The more the image changed, the sadder she got. None of this, she talked with anyone else.  


There is the theme of their careers too. Abhay joined the family business while Needhi did not know what to do with her life. Both are probably liberal arts students, but this is what attracted them to each other - their differences. Abhay is a cricketer and then works with family business. So both require team work while Needhi is a more independent person. This is the kind of person who would do something innovative when she grows up. The problem with Needhi is that she does not grow up. Even Abhay has a few problems to deal with, but since all he has to do is follow the rules it never becomes apparent that he is also immature. Now, major points are that Abhay is self assured and traditional, teamplayer while Needhi is open to new experiences, independent and a thoughtful person of a more gentle demeanour.


Yes, there it is. She has existential problems in life. Who am I? Why am I here? What am I doing? What is my purpose in life? What will bring me happiness? All good questions to ask, and answer, this is a worthy pursuit. Here, she is incompetent. That is the problem. She says she wants a weaker memory and that she wants to be less of a control freak. That is, she remembers every little thing without being able to let go, and even control is also an inability to let go. She has no concept of where her independence ends and where the world begins. She even blames Abhay for not loving her enough or stopping to love him, and this is after she breaks the engagement. So the problem that led to the freaking out at the engagement is being discussed two months after the engagement and it was someone else's fault. In fact, she blames it on him that he did not try to stop her when she was running away even though she wanted him to stop her and this is further proof that he had stopped loving her and she was angry when she was running away that she was not stopping her.

# March

This is where Abhay eMails her. And within this email we get to know one thing, she never picks up his calls. She does accept that this is cowardice, but this needs to be explored. Why does she not pick up calls? Why does she not respond to texts? Why does she respond to him now? This is probably because he was confrontational and formal and he asked her point blank. Why did she do what she did? And then she responds to him. Maybe partially because she loves him and that she never saw him this way. But she responds to him that there was a loss of feeling and that she was a coward not to return calls or texts. And that is there. So. Once the self absorbed image breaks down she starts to feel a distance. This would be repaired only through creative engagement with stress.

She has wrecked her brains but has no answer to his questions: why did she do it. However, Abhay talks about something that hints at her avoidance. She avoids calls. She avoids confrontation. She avoids meeting with Abhay when he is with some other girl and then she avoids getting into engagement. Needhi avoids everything. Needhi has a void inside her after all this avoiding.

Needhi has no answers regarding anything, but Abhay has a very concrete event that precipitated a change in the feelings: when Anamika kissed Abhay and he did not stop. Again, this hints at his lack of self regulation. There are two components: the meaning of the event and the pleasure of the event. Both are controlled by different subsytems in the brain. And this meant that he would not stop the kiss and go with the flow. This created dissonance in her head and wrecked everything apart. They decide to meet, why is that so? This is probably because they had a heart to heart and treated each other with their intimate thoughts so something built up. 

# April
The first thing that jumps out at us is how he just avoids all kind of conversation about the topics that matter. She just does not talk about things that matter to her, to the point that Abhay has to say that he will not accept that ""I don't know"" answer. So all this stupidity for three months? Just so that she could avoid facing uncomfortable situations. In the end she faced an uncomfortable situation because something in her was awakened by a conversation with Abhay. They talked. They talked about what was bothering them and so a little bit of love happened.

She talks about things that make her uncomfortable and gets very emotional, but absolutely refuses to discuss things, because she says there is no point. What she does not realize is that there has to be a point, of answering the question, ""Where do we go from here""? So she keeps ruminating, discussing and talking the same things again and again but she does not know what to do with the discussion. She does not have basic conflict resolution skills. All of this is just her feelings, but she herself does not know what to do with the feelings. 

After having two discussions, one in March and the other in April, about things that she did, she feels a little better. This is because things have moved further and Abhay has discussed and imposed his constraints. Needhi did not accept even to herself that Anamika's kiss had affected her. Which is why this was buried deep down in her psyche and the memories came back later when it was discussed. This is one of those things, she feels that if she does not talk about things then they will go away.

# May
May is her Tinder month. Here she meets three people. The first one is someone who genuinely cares for her, sees her confused and intimidated and guides her through the process. The only mistake he makes is that he does not ask her, but just goes on telling her about what he genuinely thinks is helpful. She feels he is imposing himself on her. And so she does not like it. Then she is surprised that he enjoyed himself and had a good time with her. She ghosts him.

Then there is the MNC guy who is really high up. She is really fascinated by all the work that he does and she really enjoys all the discussion. Now this could have been her ticket up, but even here she makes the mistake that she is doing nothing. She just talks about things, not about herself. This is ofcourse, the same mistake that every one makes, which is the presentation of an image to another person who is presenting an image while you have all these thoughts. All she had to say is, oh god this is so exciting and then all hell would have broken lose.

Then there is Dhruv. Perfect guy again. Does everything. Even stops calling her when she tells him not to. He is perfect in every way but she does not feel the spark. And how is one supposed to feel the spark. Talk! Dhruv, you are such a wonderful person. Oh my God. This is so amazing. Haha! And then he says something. And she talks about her own marriage. And he comforts her and they lean in. And that's that. 

# June
They have a chat in June where they start discussing some things and behave as if things are normal, or near normal. Abhay is chatting with her simply because there is a wedding coming up and he will be there with a girlfriend. Needhi takes the opportunity to give him a chance to have a conversation with her about her life. Now, the two of them have an understanding here that if one talks about her problems, she will simply not have to worry about coming across as weak. In fact that is a signal to come closer. She calls it breaking the ice. She could do the same with other people, but she does not.

She is talking about her coworkers, but she is fairly self obsessed. She has no ability to talk to other people and presents her interpretation of events rather than talk about actual facts.

There is all this talk about awkwardness, which basically makes me think, what the hell? Where is the maturity? Talk about the elephant in the room.

#July 
The one thing that stands out in all of this is Needhi's need not to have awkwardness. Awkwardness is assuming some convention, adhering to it, needing to maintain that and pretending nothing happens outside of that script. For all of Needhi's talk of her famillies adhering to some script, even this one is adherence to a script. Just the one that she chooses. She feels awkwardness, she has to be non chalant yet friendly and still not have to overcompensate. She just can not feel easy, until alcohol comes and solves the problem. Bekhuudi. A disinhibited state. Jaam ki zaroorat, hai jaise, bekhoodi ke liyey, bas ek sanam chahiyey, aashiqui ke liyey!

Needhi's friend confronts her about this and they have a conversation on whether they have really moved on or not. And then, she pushes and pulls. Slowly. She says they have moved on, then maybe they are pretending to have moved on. There is this issue, of imposing an image and pretending that things are a certain way when they themselves don't know how things already are!

Then finally it happens. They both see each other in their prime. Abhay is non challant about everything, because, of course, he has a girlfriend. Needhi becomes vulnerable, partly because she is already in a weakned state because her identity has been broken while Abhay is already there. So she is hungry and in awe of Abhay. And there he is. Non challant! As she says. And so she is weak and beautiful. Abhay takes a look at her and his primal love is reactivated. And she thinks this is love, which partially it is.

# August
She has a mix of depression, anxiety and fever by now. She thinks she was moving on, but then again, she does not move on. The body is different from her self image.  She says she wants to do something, but the body just does not respond. Of course it won't. This is textbook creative stress. Change will not happen in such a manner. And that is the point, she has to confront everything. And had Abhay never really gotten back to her, she would have had to move on and deal with everything, but no, that is not how it happens.

Abhay talks about being distant from his girlfriend. What is going on is that his mind has been occupied by Needhi. Simran is automatically put in the backseat. He keeps on blabbering about how he gave all of him to her but that was not enough, and that introduces us to a new concept. What do you mean giving it his all? So, that is one thing.

She felt better when she had run away, temporarily. But now she is devastated. There she had to confront the fact that life would not be like she imagined it to be so she freaked out. Now she has to confront the fact that she still loves Abhay and she does not have him in her life and so she freaks out again. And this time it is major, because she has to do something. But then, she gets it all without doing anything. She is basically a slave to her feelings. Later on we find out that what she just blurts out everything to him. That is all that she does.

# September
She is reminiscing about their times together. Needhi freaks out always because she has no endgame in mind and when Abhay scolds her or tutors her or lectures her she gets defensive. But the point is that she is reminiscing. All the good memories are coming back.

She admits that they never had any such problems at the time. Why? Because they had nothing to do, really. All they had to do was be in love and enjoy the feeling and keep performing the same identity.

The one thing that I keep missing out on here is that she is doing really badly in her career too. She does not have her shit together. This is form an existential standpoint and also the fact that she has no identity to work from. This is precisely what ego does, it does not settle, it does not sacrifice. It does not know what to do.

# October
She finally gives in. First there is the rumination. She finds a hundred reasons for them not to be together and then she finds a hundred reasons for them to be together.

Trust comes up over and over again. They have trust issues, yes, of course they will have because they are both unable to deal with anything, they have no binding reality and they act on their whims. 

Even though she has been making Abhay dance all over her tune, she blames him for kissing Anamika and precipitating this. She takes no note of the fact that she did not want to deal with it and suppressed the memory.

# November
Abhay is clearly still in love with her, but he is also torn apart. He is completely broken. She just left without an explanation, on a whim without doing anything really to be responsible towards Abhay. So he wants her but he tells her that he cannot trust her and she has to have made a good decision that she is fully in. They do not know what a decision is.

Abhay is made to feel guilty and he is already being manipulated by her unknowingly because he is making the promise that he is going to wake up every day trying to gain her trust. So now we know that they do not have any idea on how trust emerges either. The more important part is that Needhi has a very bad effect on Abhay and the children do not discuss this with their parents or other responsible adults.

Their idea of moving past trauma is to forget it, which is really bad. Cheating and abandoning. Well. What the fuck. Really. Also, I promise to be yours if you promise to be mine. Mine and yours. Also. What the fuck. Conditional love. It's not conditional, it's a contract.

# December
She feels 19 again.

They have a set of promises one is about playing devil's advocate.

They are marrying, but then since they have not had any commitments here, no concept and no growth what is going on is that they will break up again, brutally. And that is why this is a viciously funny book if you know what the fuck is going on. She breaks up with him and then tells him to marry him again and now they are going to marry each other without changing anything. So what happened, really? Nothing!

24,AskIndia,[Policy] Creating Jobs in the Indian Economy,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/66u52j/policy_creating_jobs_in_the_indian_economy/,"An AskIndia thread asked the same question. I replied without reading this person's entire post - which turned out to be trolling. So I'm reposting my comment here. It starts with some historical background, and ends with a comparative description of how other countries have performed.

---

**My Answer:** Clothes and Shoes

1. **Industrialization**: Historically, models of industrialisation have followed two pathways:
 * *Slow but Steady:* Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. This helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weak.
 * *Accelerated Growth:* economic successes mostly in East Asia began authoritarian, explicitly (Korea, China) or de facto (Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan), and gave way to political transformation only after a degree of economic success was achieved.

2. **Where does India Stand**: India has attempted economic development while also granting universal franchise from the very beginning. The only other countries in this group are Botswana, Mauritius, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Costa Rica — all perennial democracies. At independence, India was one of the poorest nations, regardless of political system, with a per capita GDP of just $617 (PPP). This implies:
 * The Indian state has been ever burdened by the demands for redistribution since early in its life - leading to the poor state capacity we see today (healthcare, education, law enforcement).
 * There is a distrust of the Private Sector and over-reliance on Public capacity.
 * 'Exit', that is, winding down, declaring bankruptcy, and plugging inefficiencies is hard because of diverse stakeholders, vested interests, and poor institutions

3. **What Kind of Jobs does India Need:**  India needs to generate jobs that are formal and productive, provide bang-for-buck in terms of jobs created relative to investment, have the potential for broader social transformation, and can generate exports and growth. Apparel and Footwear sectors fit this bill.

4. **How have Apparel and Footwear worked for the East Asian Economies?** In the successful East Asian economies, countries where GDP growth booms averaged between 7-10 per cent, growth in the exports of these two sectors was exceptional. For comparison, over a 20 year period ""post-liberalisation"" for each economy:
 * Country|Year of Take-Off|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Apparel|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Leather and Footwear|Annual avg economic growth for 20 years post take off (per cent)|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
Korea|1962|30.4|69.9|9.0|
BGL|1985|27.9|29.8|5.2|
Thailand|1960|53.8|44.1|7.5|
Indonesia|1967|65.8|48.6|7.0|
Malaysia|1970|33.4|27.5|6.9|
China|1978|18.6|27.7|9.8|
Vietnam|1985|17.8|16.1|6.6|
India|1980|12.7|5.4|5.6|

5. **Why has India under-performed?** For a lot of historical, religious, and socio-cultural reasons. However, those pertinent to contemporary times include:
 * *Logistics*: Costs and Time for getting goods from factory-to-port are greater. Furthermore, Indian ports are unequipped to handle very large capacity containers. We use Sri Lankan ports for such transshipments.
 * *Labor Regulations*: Labor costs are low, but regulations strangulate formalization because of high overtime pay requirements, de facto EPF contribution taxes for low-paid workers, and inflexible firing policies.

 * *Tax and Tariff Policies*: India's domestic tax policies and unbalanced in that they promote cotton-based fibres instead of man-made fibres, which is the bulk of the global demand. Similarly, the global demand is for non-leather footwear, while India's share of global exports in leather footwear are double that of non-leather footwear (ie. it wrongly focuses on leather footwear)

 * *Export Market Discrimination*: EU and US impose customs tariffs on Indian apparel and footwear exports at ~10%, while it is 0% for Bangladesh. So Indian firms shift operations outside of India.

**What should India do? / What is it doing?** I'll add in this later if I see this post getting enough traction. Writing all of this took a lot of time in and of itself. If you have any suggestions, write away in the comments!"," There's a great recent episode on Rajya Sabha TV's ""State of the Economy"" where they discuss employment in India.

 Some really interesting contributions here already. There is one crucial sector we might be overlooking though - public sector jobs, especially police, judiciary and healthcare workers. 

This is important, firstly, because most of our public services are so understaffed. There is massive log jamming in the judiciary for instance, scant police coverage in most areas, absolute lack of healthcare facilities in a large part of the country. An efficient economy can only be built in the foundation of a well functioning polity. A healthier, safer society is an absolute necessity for a healthy economy. 

Secondly, having more public sector jobs ends up creating more private jobs, especially in the service economy. 

The problem we run into when speaking of public sector is jobs is financing. This is a big problem. I believe fully staffing our public services is an investment. We don't question the need for physical infrastructure, we shouldn't for well staffed public services. Also, it's high time we did something about the shameful legacy of the past - housing our netas in palatial bungalows, the most expensive real estate in the country. Sell of Lutyens Delhi babu bungalows, create a fund, invest in human capital.  This should be a sticky post Economic Survey this year had a separate chapter on clothes and shoes, you should read that. EU Resident here. Most of the top quality branded clothes (hoodies, tshirts and jeans) we wear here and houseries (including IKEA) are actually made in Bangladesh.

If anyone can supply these products with same quality and similar price, I can create a few jobs in India. Good start. Admins should close the other troll/genocide thread. 

I'll try to divide my reply in two parts. The first where I reply to some of your points and the second where I'll try to write up some new parts which you didn't touch on.
__________________________________________________________

**First part**

> Slow but Steady: Western Economies

> Accelerated Growth: East Asia

This is actually somewhat inaccurate. As Dani Rodrik and many others have pointed out, *there has only been one single path to prosperity* for large economies which can't rely on fossil fuels or on tourism(like Trinidad and Tobago). That's the path of export-led manufacturing growth. 

Most people mistakenly think this is the ""East Asian"" model but this was how the UK, Germany and France all developed. Same is true with the US. Manufacturing was a huge part of the US economy up until perhaps the 1970s. 

Some people claim India can't replicate this model for two reasons. The first is automation/AI, which limits employment opportunity. The second is slow trade/protectionism. I'll be brief on both.

As far as AI/Automation is concerned, a lot of people have to understand that plenty of jobs that were counted as manufacturing in the past were actually service sector jobs. It's just that they were in the factory back in the old days. Today everything is hyper-specialised, so a lot of those jobs have moved out but are so-called ""auxiliary services"". They don't get counted with manufacturing today, but they should. If they were, job losses aren't nearly as bad as it's made out to be.

As for trade/protectionism is concerned, it's true that the world economy is growing slower than during the boom times, but historical perspective is needed. The average growth during the 1990s was slower than what the world economy is growing at right now. Korea, Taiwan and the other Asian tigers as well as Ireland and some Eastern European nations(Poland, Slovakia etc) had very rapid growth during this period, despite generally low global growth. So, I think this excuse doesn't really hold today. Yes, the opportunities are lower than in the 2000s, but from a historical perspective they are slightly above average.  Sadly our focus has been on cotton and yarn exports. At best fabrics and some niches like home textiles. We haven't been able to crack the apparels segment.

Our largest textile companies (measured in terms of investment or market cap) are yarn companies or home fabrics companies. 

In footwear we could have an edge in leather footwear, but this beef ban thing could be a detterant.  /u/ringtring your original post is good but I would like to point that Thailand, BGL(Bangladesh?), Malaysia and Indonesia are not under East Asia but under ASEAN. Few points.  

> Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. 

Semantic use of the term *in tandem* is not accurate enough plus the timelines are so broad they are meaningless.  

Using such broad terms one can even say that South Korea developed under this slow western model because it changed its system before it had become developed.  

The fact is the political development is a spectrum in itself and the West like US esp. was on the end of this spectrum closer to everyone else who developed than on the other end of it, where basically no one exists.  
Meaning, no one has ever developed under a democracy. And since democracies are of various types we need to provide context for it and that context was provided. Things like universal suffrage is a basic and easy metric(India is an older proper democracy than US in this manner), other can be used as well like the power holdings among a few rich homogeneous elites even despite the voting rights.  

As for the point on why India has under-performed.  

The fundamental reasons are that India has not followed the general path that leads to development. There is no Universal model for it but there are certain practices which are near-universal meaning they are de facto pre-requisite requirements.  

Things like having an Infrastructure in place before you set up a secondary and tertiary sector like Services and R&D.  
This a a dynamic which goes even beyond Industrialization. There is no development and stability without Infra development. Roads were the first things a new empire build.  
Then at the same time as this is Land reforms, its another prerequisite. There are plenty of evidence for this with countries that developed in the 20th century.  

Everything else comes afterwards. India is accumulating factors which are exceptional, things like Democracy from the get go, Tertiary sector before Infrastructure. Land reform not even done barring few places like Kerala.  

Its no wonder things wouldn't be smooth sailing. 

And about What India needs.  
I am of a different view. India should help where the people are and they are in the Primary sector, they are farmers. That is where the labor force is. Help them and you solve multiple problems. Problems like lack of jobs if everyone over the coming generations is supposed to enter the job pool. Problems like not enough capital for other major works which will become obsolete (exclusive factories are not a sound long term gambit). Problems like uprooting people in a country like India which is unique in terms of its diversity and already having massive population density issues.  

Helping the people in the agriculture sector is the biggest bang for the buck. It helps bring the HDI levels up, it helps the social security dynamic. It helps in the balanced development of all/majority people argument.   

Currently though there is no proper model for it. And this is where my views are different than most. India is already doing things in its own way. It is already the exception. It should look for new models of growth instead of relying on pre-exiting ones which may or may not really be that effective at the stage India is in. No model is universal, they have to be fitted to the place they are being implemented in. India should look for solutions which are novel and unique to its situation.   

Currently though India seems to have picked the same model of growth that has been used by majority of the world and that is Rapid Growth through fast tracked Urbanization. 10 years back Indian urbanization rate was less than 20%, now its reaching mid 30's.  
To me this goes against the India ethos and even practically its not sound for India given its unique spread of population over a smaller area and stressed natural resources.   When Koreans/Chinese started to make toys to be sold in the west, they never knew they would become some one like this. Indian ways of growing is not faulty, it can be considered as a new way. We have a lot problems which most previous governments ignored and China/Korea/US gave a lot of importance during early industrialization.

Industrialization needs infrastructure, skilled worker and rule of law which are missing in India.

* We have a pathetic infrastructure. Because the government doesn't want to anger people and politicians have a huge interest in infrastructure building, we could not build everything very quickly. Roads/Bridges/Ports/Railways are very slow and inefficient. Most people will not leave land easily. The environment must be protected. The contractors also make a lot of money by building everything slowly and of bad quality.

* Rural education is in a very bad condition. Most factory workers, construction crew usually come from rural areas. In India, most of them are very unskilled and difficult to be trained.

* Inefficient governance is also another reason. Our state is very backward. It takes days for people to get the documents and months for companies. Bureaucrats usually don't work for people unless someone attacks them. Law enforcement is also very bad. 

 This post and the discussion that it brought fold is gold! I've been through the entire thread and this is some real quality discussion. Thanks to everyone who contributed to the discussion. ☺️ Reading it has been a pleasure. 

It's disheartening that the comments don't have as many points and the ones in the political threads do.  One area prime for reforms and job creation I feel is agriculture. I think India is employing a huge proportion of it's population in farming and yet it's very inefficient, maybe the latter is the cause for former. I think agriculture can be leveraged to bring jobs to rural areas bu investing in rural infrastructure creation, warehouses and storage, distribution and transportation and food processing. This coupled with building human resource capital in rural and semi-urban areas be it teachers. public transportation workers, support personnels etc. 

Manufacturing should be our main focus and we should focus on both domestic oriented and export oriented manufacturing.  >  Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. This helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weak.

As far as UK is concerned, what period was the capacity weak & when did it become strong? I don't think India has an  unemployment problem It just has people who don't want to work.  "

Not sure if it's the same as your thinking, but here's an article about how farm loan waivers don't help in the long run. Helping everyone is the best way to get votes. We are studying foreign policy this sem. This is the point my teacher makes again and again. Indians are so busy with basic issues that the other issues including foreign policy are ignored. It is one of the reasons that the Indian foreign policy is so non aggressive. It is hard to distract the public with basics when there is a war going on. Compare that to that of the US where foreign policy is one of the issues of presidential debate. I know it's unrelated but we did it in class today and I just wanted to share.

This is actually a throwaway account as my friends know me on reddit. As you may have already understood by the title, I am hopelessly in love with a girl. I know it sounds a cliche, but she is perhaps the most beautiful girl I have ever laid my eyes upon. I am afraid to tell her anything just because I am bald and am pretty sure she would reject my advances. This is not meant to be bragging, but  I am actually quite well settled for life in a secure job and being an only child, the legal heir to my parents' properties. I have come to terms with the fact of my baldness, but she is the only fact I haven't come to terms with. Everytime I see her, there is this feeling of overwhelming helplessness and numbness. Should I tell her of my love for her or should I just forget her and resign myself to my fate? The latter is a scary thought, but seems to be the better alternative as I am afraid her rejection would destroy me from within. Please help a brother out.

Ask her out, go have a few drinks, see what happens.  Dude if u think balding is a problem, then life has got some nasty surprises in store for you. You say you are well settled.

29,AskIndia,Buying an apartment in Hyderabad,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8dg2ih/buying_an_apartment_in_hyderabad/,"Hi everyone,
I am planning to buy an apartment in Hafeezpet. The total amount is 47 lakhs for ~1100 Sqft near main road. Is this normal price? I am not so keen on buying but my parents in India are adamant about it. Rent expected is around 15000 + 1500 maintenance. Planning to take a loan for 30 Lakhs and use cash 20 Lakhs.

Edit: I don't know why I am getting downvoted :( I just asked a question with the AskIndia flair!"," When you said “Parents in India” I am assuming you are abroad. Actually my parents also forced me to buy a house which was around 75 lakhs(chennai), but I didn’t . I don’t know about your age, income, risk appetite etc . Here is what I would do.

1) If I have 20 lakhs cash, bare minimum I would deposit in FD which would earn interest of 12,500/month. This is based on RBL bank interest rate.
2) I would then use 50% of this 12,500 every month to invest in stocks and 25% into mutual funds and keep the remaining as cash for rainy day.
3) if I have more risk appetite I would divide this 20 lakhs into multiple staggered buy for stock which I am currently studying. 
4) Rental income in India is not profitable plus you will pay EMI for probably 20 years which is again a burden on you.
5) there are beautiful EMI calculators online which will tell you how much you will end up paying for the 27 Lakhs for 20 years which is around 58 lakhs.

Is it worth it?? Meh....

This is just my thought...... Bro if you want to buy it because you and your parents need a place of your own to live and given that you can pay it off with the time you have left on your visa then it makes more sense. As much as I understand and appreciate  people living off a rented space because for them economically it makes sense. I would still suggest you to buy your own place it will give you peace of mind and moving every two - three year is not that fun on the top of everything intrusive flat owners.


   But if your sole aim is to save some money or create a new asset like this place as a future investment. Then I might suggested you should look for other investment opportunities, in that case atleast you will have a rough idea how much return you can expect off your money down the line.

30,AskIndia,PSA: /r/India Submission Flairs & How to Use Them,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4fyjjl/psa_rindia_submission_flairs_how_to_use_them/,"###/r/India submission flairs and how to use them

#Q: What are submission flairs and what are they used for?

A: Submission flairs are the text-boxes that appear next to your submission title when you post something on /r/India. There are various different submission flairs but we will get to each category later. The flairs help users in filtering the content of this subreddit. For example if you want to look at all the Political submissions then simply click on the yellow 'Politics' text-box next to any political submission and you will land up in [**this page**](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3APolitics).

#Q: How do I know what flair to use?

A: Use common sense, for example:

* **1. Reddiquette:** If you want a civil and focused discussion with NO off-topic comments, choose 'Rediquette'. We do not allow trolling and other unnecessary behaviour in threads marked as 'Reddiquette' threads. Please don't use this for 'zoke' threads. 

* **2. Policy:** All posts about central or state policies must be flaired 'Policy'. If your submission is about rural electrification or regulating app-based cab services, then the submission must be flaired 'Policy'. If you post a question about a policy then the post must be flaired as 'Policy' and not 'AskIndia'. 

* **3. Politics:** All posts about politics and politicians in India must be flaired as 'Politics' (unless 'Policy' is the more appropriate choice). Even if the submission is about the fact that a certain politician has their favorite shoe-fetching airlines, the post must be flaired as 'Politics'. Again, if you post a question about Indian politics or politicians then the post must be flaired as 'Politics' and not 'AskIndia'. 

* **4. Science & Technology/Food/Sports:** These are self-explanatory. All submissions about sci-tech must be flaired as 'Science & Technology' as long they have no policy/political aspect. If the submission is about research on Zika virus then flair it as 'Science & Technology', if the submission is about allocation of central funds in Zika virus research then flair it as 'Policy', if the submission is about how a certain minister claims that his/her influence accelerated the progress of Zika virus research then flair it as 'Politics'. Same reasoning applies for 'Food' and 'Sports'.

* **5. AskIndia:** This flair is to be used only when you post a question and if none of the previous flair is applicable.

* **6. Scheduled:** For all the RDD submissions and other weekly/biweekly/monthly submissions. 

* **7. Non-Political:** When none of the above flairs are applicable use this flair.


#Q: How do I apply the flairs?

A: Once you make a submission, you'll notice a red button which says *Flair your post* . Click on it and choose a flair according to the submission's theme, then hit Save.
**Example**: https://i.imgur.com/FKs9uVI.png

If you are posting from a handheld device, then please use the following abbreviations in the submission title and the flair will be added automatically.

* Politics: [P], [Politics], [Political]
* Non-Political: [NP], [Non-Political], [Non Political]
* Net-Neutrality: [NN], [Net-Neutrality], [Net Neutrality]
* Scheduled: [Scheduled]
* AskIndia: [ASK], [AS], [AskIndia], [Help]
* Sports: [Sports], [SP]
* Policy: [Policy]
* Science & Technology: [TE], [Tech], [Technology], [Sci], [Science], [Sci & Tech], [Science & Technology]
* Food: [Food], [FO]
* Reddiquette: [R], [Serious], [Reddiquette]

#Q: Can I have multiple flairs for one submission?

A: No. If you are posting from a hand-held device make sure that you add only one flair abbreviation in the submission title. If you are posting from a computer you cannot select more than one flair anyway. 

#Q: So, what happens if I 'mis-flair' a submission?

A: If you inadvertently use the wrong flair abbreviation then we will fix it ourselves. If you are on a hand-held device and want to change the flair of your submission to 'Reddiquette' then message us and we will do it for you. 

If we see repeated misuse of submission flairs then we will have a chat with you, your submission may get removed etc etc.

31,AskIndia,Well articulated anti congress Whatsapp forward. Bhakton ki nayi [p]eshkash,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7zckca/well_articulated_anti_congress_whatsapp_forward/,"


Received on the family whatsapp group

""A brilliant answer by Bala Senthil Kumar to the question below, as answered at popular Q&A site Quora.

 What is your view on the saying ""Congress has looted India for 70 years?""

It isn't the looting of wealth that bothers me so much as the sheer fact that the Congress merely replaced the Brits in some ways - they just became masters of the same, broken, weak people, who were simply willing to suck up to authority. Nobody gave India confidence! This is the part that bothers me so much, especially with MK Gandhi's style of 'winning' us freedom by giving the enemy higher moral ground.

So, India has grown up as an apologetic impotent nation, where our children are taught to revere impractical, passive, cowardly notions like non-violence, when everything in nature tells us to fight to survive. Of course I know the philosophy of not fighting because of being strong. But this comes from mastery, not shamelessly bowing to masters!

So, we saw a change of guard. The Brits went, and new masters came in the form of the Congress Party. Hierarchies remained, the class system remained, and subservience remained. Where the heck did all the dynamism go?

Then we were thrown into a socialist mindset, people waiting for alms from government wealth redistribution programs instead of being empowered. We got protectionist policies, that prevented prosperity and competition, throwing us away from a path of a meritocracy. Hindustan Motors was started around the same time as Toyota, and Tata Steel started around the same time as Nippon Steel. Nippon Steel produces around five times as much as Tata Steel without native resources of ore. No need to talk about Hindustan Motors and Toyota. Japan coming out of twin nuclear strikes was devastated way more than India under the Brits. Do we need to compare how different the growth paths of these two nations have been?

Only when thousands died did we start the Green Revolution. Only when China attacked us did we realize we need to become militarily stronger. Only with our backs against the wall, did India liberalize its economy. Under the Congress, every move we have made towards any kind of development has come under inevitable circumstances, with our backs against the wall.

India was never allowed to be truly independent, strong, and proud of its people's full potential. No wonder so many of us left in droves and thrived in various countries elsewhere. This is the loot I would feel most wronged by - denying India its best talents and minds, because we didn't create the conditions for dignified development.

Incredibly, the immense sacrifices of our fighting heroes were also swept aside under this avalanche of worship for Gandhiji. Why? So that the Brits would feel good? The Congress party was reporting to British Intelligence for 5 years after we became an independent country, about Subhash Bose's family's movements. During a criminal probe of the Bofors scandal, the Congress External Affairs minister delivered a letter to a foreign body to deny evidence and cooperation to an Indian investigating agency. Years later, a whole bunch of Congress members and their cronies used the letterhead of the Indian Parliament to petition the USA to not issue a visa to Narendra Modi, the man who would become Prime Minister. 

The Congress has a clear obsession with white people and a need to constantly please them. When Hillary Clinton asked India to wean itself off Iranian oil, the Congress government promptly obliged, even though Iran and India have been close friends for a long time. No surprise then that pasta aunty from Italy is their supremo. Think she would have got the same respect if she had been a Nigerian black woman? I don't think so. That's how deeply ingrained the slave mentality is in the ranks of the Congress.

It is the loot of India's pride, dignity, dynamism and die hard spirit that bothers me much much more than the loot of wealth. This country produced enough wealth to support the British Empire for 200 years. It can easily produce much more to ensure prosperity, health and well being for its own people. This is an abundant, powerful country, that has been prevented from being a developed, forward thinking, awesome nation that could by now have been an example for the world.

If India has been a weak, apologetic nation for so long, it's precisely because of the Congress. Why do we have to put up with these weasels and the fools who are aligning with them? I could even tolerate a ruthless, despotic, dictatorial mindset. It is this slimy, backstabbing, self serving Lutyens mindset that really irks me. I would give anything to destroy this smugness, decimate it, and put it firmly behind us.

The economic loot is nothing compared to this, but we will bloody well make them pay for all of it.

I received this message. I want you to read and think about it. I am forwarding for that purpose""

"," BJP has learnt a lot from the humble onion, narratives on narratives and the core, nothing. > Nobody gave India confidence! 

Playing with people's insecurities. Not getting any women. Use this Axe deodorant and women will flock to you.

Did congress do nothing to give confidence to Indian people? When congress came to power it denotified the tribes which had so far been classified as criminal tribes. By recognizing their humanity, and by giving them an equal opportunity did it not give them confidence. What about the right to vote given to women and outcasts? Was it not ahistoric in the region. And the states which were created on linguistic basis. 

> MK Gandhi's style of 'winning' us freedom by giving the enemy higher moral ground.

It was exactly opposite. Gandhism is a method to uphold the humanity and moral standards of the victims. 

> Hierarchies remained, the class system remained, and subservience remained. 

When congress came to power, one of the first thing it did was to abolish zamindari system. Then it gave voice and entitlements to outcasts. 

> Where the heck did all the dynamism go?

Dynamism of British period? Are sanghis missing their 'golden age' under white masters?

> people waiting for alms from government wealth redistribution programs instead of being empowered

People were not waiting for alms. People were poor and starving. Some folks have forgotten how poor India was and still it. Should congress have allowed them to die like China did? Is taking care of starving people and empowering them mutually exclusive? Can you not do both at the same time? Was it not something congress did?


> India was never allowed to be truly independent, strong, and proud of its people's full potential. No wonder so many of us left in droves and thrived in various countries elsewhere. 

NRI's guilt. 

 
 FFS all these chutiyas complaining about India's ""weakness and impotence"" are so clearly projecting their own shortcomings.

India managed to stay ""non-aligned"" under severe pressure from both US and USSR under Nehru. We were able to stave off handing over economy to the World Bank and IMF for as long as we could and when he opened up, we did it on our terms. We engaged in 4 wars and came out on top in at least 3.

We lifted more people out of poverty than any other country except China and corrected social injustices like untouchability which had existed for centuries.

And all of this while being a functional democracy, empowering civic institutions and fostering an inclusive multilingual, multicultural society.

How on earth - can someone say that is weak? If your family thinks this is any sort of accurate or well articulated I fear for their intelligence. Just a hypocritical NRI bhakt ranting about things he is  too lazy and selfish to change himself.  So many similarities between our new dumb entitled middle class and the hypocritical nationalist nris."
32,AskIndia,"[R] Updated Wiki, Rules & Flairs",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3huilc/r_updated_wiki_rules_flairs/,"#Comment Moderation in Political & Religious Threads

* Low-effort comments that don't contribute to the discussion will be removed.
* Slurs and invectives - we need to participate in discussions without resorting to juvenile name calling.
* Flaming the forum, that is, asking “where are the people of X party or Y group now” adds nothing constructive to the discussion and will be removed. 
* Serious, on topic, high effort conversation. This means most jokes, memes, non-contributive comments will be removed.
* **Political humour posts are exempt from these rules.**

The basic premise is that your comment should be constructive and should add something to the discussion. If all you are looking to do is pick a fight, then /r/India is not the place for you. 

#The Governance Flair

* **Would be renamed to Policy**. It applies to any new policy decision announced by the government (or new policy discussions that /r/India participants want to focus on) and applies to self-posts as well as link-posts. 
* **Comment Moderation would be similar to Political Threads.**
* To ensure that the focus remains on the policy aspect of a political post, users **must** add a submission statement limiting the discussion to a specific policy issue, and/or a specific policy correction.


#Low Effort Political/Policy/Religious Posts

* Link submissions that refer personal and verified Twitter accounts can only be made if the OP substantiates his views in a self-post (accounts like @narendramodi and @ArvindKejrwal are personal accounts and therefore not allowed for direct submissions; @PMOIndia is allowed). 
* Direct submission to non-personal and unverified Twitter accounts for political and policy posts is also not allowed.  
* Similarly, if you wish to cite an unverified Twitter account for a political/policy/religious post, you need to do so in a self-post (after hiding personal information from said tweet) and substantiate what you wish to discuss in the thread.
* Similar rule applies for image submissions for political/policy/religious posts. OP must cite the source for the image and accompany the image submission with a statement regarding the topic he/she wishes to discuss.

#Unverified Posts

* Info-graphics, images, selfs posts and other similar content which makes (an) assertion(s) but lacks (a) source(s) will be removed. The original submitter [OP] should post the source (if it is not cited in the submission itself) as soon as possible. If the OP receives a message from a moderator stating that their post has been delisted [removed] due to lack of source, they may still provide the source and the the submission will be relisted [unremoved].

#Editorialising

* Editorialising is not acceptable. Editorialising is simply the act of inserting an opinion into a (submission) title. You should, in most cases, use the title on the page you are linking to. 
* However, in the case of YouTube, you may have to be inventive and attempt to create an **nonpartisan** and **neutral** title if the one the YouTube video uses is clearly partisan and bias.

#Subreddit promotion via user flairs

* You are allowed to promote any subreddit with your user flairs as long as the subreddit you are promoting is listed under the [list of India related subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/wiki/related_subreddits) at the /r/India wiki. 

#Mobile Flairs
* AskIndia: [Ask], [AS], [Askindia],[Help]
* Sports: [SP]
* Technology: [TECH],[TE]
* Food: [FO], [Food]
* Non-Political: [NP], [Non-Political]
* Politics: [P], [Politics]"," You guys are increasing your own work and in a couple of days you won't be able to do what you started and then selectively apply rules. Happens every time you still don't learn.  I'm confused.

> * **Link submissions** that refer non-personal and verified Twitter accounts can only be made if the OP substantiates his views in a **self-post**

1. A self-post? Do you mean a comment?
2. Do you mean ""non-personal verified"" instead of ""non-personal and verified""?

> Direct submission to non-personal and unverified Twitter accounts for political and policy posts is also not allowed.

Isn't submission of unverified account anyway not allowed?

And so the only twitter accounts that are allowed for direct link submission are ""non-personal verified"" accounts like @PMOIndia, right? >Similarly, if you wish to cite an unverified Twitter account for a political/policy/religious post, you need to do so in a self-post (after hiding personal information from said tweet) and substantiate what you wish to discuss in the thread.

In such a submission can the name of the twitter handle be mentioned in the title? Have seen a few such posts in the recent past. All of this is going to lead to  more controversies.  Ok, I almost never checkin here except when I do the odd RDD thread but I cannot believe this kind of policing is still happening!

What kind of a place has this turned into that it's making normal everyday indians who are more worried about the kujhli in their underpants to be this aggressive brand of assholes? Here we go again. More and more poorly thought out rules, imposed on the subreddit without any discussion. 

Indians are political and argumentative people. You mods cannot wish that away with your silly rules. Just let the sub be instead of trying to sanitize the discussions. 

This is a chai stall at a railway station, not a formal dinner in Victorian England.  Why is so much importance being given to political/religious threads? 

Why isn't the 'no low-effort' rule being applied to all the threads and posts? 

Man, either apply the rules uniformly or don't apply them at all and let us decide if something is high or low effort. I have seen the 'no low-effort' rule in other subs too but they apply it to everything. More subjective rules with loopholes as a pre-requisite and a necessary design criteria. 

Now, there is no way to differentiate between these two. 

1. This means most jokes, memes, non-contributive comments will be removed.
2. Political humour posts are exempt from these rules.

So, basically, when our **subjective call** says that the user is ""*Flaming the forum*"", we can insta-ban the user. But, we can use yet another **subjective call** to claim that a different user was just indulging in Political humor. 

Just let this forum be. Why the fuck do we have religious threads This is how you make a Dead Sub. I've seen /r/india's rules worst so far. The twitter rules are fucking irritating.  >This means most jokes, memes, non-contributive comments will be removed.

WTF. Why can't you guys just let the sub be as it is without adding new rules etc for even one month?

>Would be renamed to Policy. It applies to any new policy decision announced by the government

I don't understand the need for a separate flair for this. Such discussions should be under Politics. [removed] Less objectivity, more subjectivity... I can already see numerous ways in which these rules can be twisted and interpreted to suit a person's personal biases.

>Low-effort comments that don't contribute to the discussion will be removed.

What criteria will be used to decide whether a comment is low-effort or not? Mods' subjective views?

>asking “where are the people of X party or Y group now” adds nothing constructive to the discussion and will be removed.

Okay, so if supporters of a particular party bash another party based on a false report(as has happened so many times), and later on the truth gets posted, can we not ask where the bashers are now? Whats wrong with that? Nice. Also please try and do a full revision of the rules. Like all the rules at one place. Hallelujah!! Thanks for this! Are these rules going live along with post, or are you looking for building up opinion and then implememting it? 
 Agreed with the policy for political threads, but not religious threads. As rational people we should be allowed to ridicule religions. Not adherents, but the religion itself. 

If I wish to call Mohammad a paedophile, Yahweh a genocidal maniac or Indra a pussy-man, there shouldn't be a ban on it.  Could you sticky this, please? >accounts like @narendramodi and @ArvindKejrwal are personal accounts and therefore not allowed for direct submissions


WTF? Also, /r/IndianPeopleFacebook should be listed under related subs. 

/r/IndianFootball too. Oh, NSFW Indian subs too. Why the discrimination? What about genuine criticism of some aspect of a religion? For instance, me calling radhe maa human diarrhoea posing as a Hindu, rather than, say, calling Hinduism diarrhoea in religion form. So where exactly are you drawing the line?"
33,AskIndia,[Modpost] New Flairs for /r/India and Improving Discussions on /r/India,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3de8cn/modpost_new_flairs_for_rindia_and_improving/,"Hello folks!

Moderators of /r/India here (using a common account).

###Flairs

We promised to give you flairs, and we have not kept our promise. So, here goes. We suggest the following flairs (and if there are any that you want to see added, please suggest them)

* AskIndia
* Governance: To separate policy decisions from Political Posts

As mentioned above, please suggest new flairs that you would want to see. 

Now, let's address discussion in /r/India threads, especially political posts. A few ideas. **Do note that these are only ideas, we are not implementing them. We are only looking for your opinion**. 

###Political Posts

* No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter. If you want to submit an image or a twitter post, create a self-post and explain what is it that you want to discuss about it.
* Political discussions should be strictly [R] enforced. We want to implement this, but we have fallen short because we don't have enough active moderators. We would need to hire more. The problem is we need to find people who have the time and inclination to do this. 
* Remove low-effort political self-posts. 

### Non-political posts

* Same rule as politics for Twitter post (and other social media screenshots including memes). Specify what you want to discuss and substantiate your stand in a self-post. /r/India should not be the place to discuss WhatsApp forwards. 

Please feel free to disagree with all the points made here. :)
"," Could you improve wiki? Many times a post/comment is removed citing some non-existent rule. And you don't allow to make meta post about it. Which I can understand because you don't want drama. You ask to send mod mail. We send but then you don't reply to mod mails too. 

* Remove politics from this sub. Like /r/unitedkingdom has /r/ukpolitics, /r/canada has /r/CanadaPolitics, /r/australia has /r/AustralianPolitics etc remove political post and direct people to post in /r/indianpolitics. It will improve this sub.

* Make things transparent. /r/Futurology has /r/FuturologyModerators/ and /r/FuturologyRemovals/ where removed things are recorded WITH reason. /r/technology has has their automod configuration public /r/technology/wiki/automoderator. Use a meta sub to which allows easier communication and discussions. Case in point /r/metacanada 

* Add this post and other mod announcement posts in the /r/india wiki.  [deleted] >No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter. If you want to submit an image or a twitter post, create a self-post and explain what is it that you want to discuss about it.

If I have to explain my meme or image in a self-post it is kind of counter intuitive, no? 

I mean, a picture is supposed to be worth a thousand words. My two bits:

* Remove the political post/politics altogether from this sub.

 our life is teeming with enough politics already be it newspaper or news channel with blaring mindless debates airing all day. And since many redditors have complained about the same in many self posts it seems like the right time to do so.
You can direct those who wants to discuss that to something like /r/indiapolitics if it exists or make one for them like many other countries sub did , if still you see people have this great uncontrolled urge to discuss which politician wrote what on twitter and those other shit you can always give them a warning first and if they don't comply then ban them from this sub(not shadowban,let them know why they are banned).

*  I'd suggest some flairs like **arts, sports and religion**. More flairs will keep different posts from getting mixed and people interested in a particular thing probably won't downvote the stuff they are not interested in and new genuine posts in their respective category will hopefully get a breathe of upvote from interested people. +1 for no political twitter spam > Remove low-effort political self-posts

Please elaborate on this?

Also, you guys to need to ensure greater transparency in your process. >No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter. If you want to submit an image or a twitter post, create a self-post and explain what is it that you want to discuss about it.

I don't think this serves any purpose at all. The reason these memes and tweet links exist is not for OPs to score cool karma points, but to reinforce his/her own political views. So self post or not, these low effort posts would continue to clutter the feed. 

>Remove low-effort political self-posts.

You will need to elaborate on this or else you are going to get accused of muzzling opinions.  Since there is an announcement, I want to bring up couple of points which affects the quality of discussion here.  These are tangentially related.             
Does this sub have an official stand or voice on any issue? Is it a place for discussion only or reddit India supported activism?  For example Net neutrality debate. I think the official voice of redditindia should not get into activism irl. It encourages brigading and suppressing contrary voices.          
I think it was wrong that redditindia took an official position on contentious issue like NN which lead to brigading in real life.  Shouldn't have happened.            
Second, do we need the twitter account of redditindia to tweet hot posts? And is there a criteria. I  have seen low effort self posts getting tweeted. I  see that as an encouragement. 
 Ooh.. common account as a mod.. 

*interesting*

Governance flair sounds good. Hopefully we'll have more discussions on that.
 How about a flair to seperate the faking news/unreal times articles from the real news. > Political discussions should be strictly [R] enforced.

> Remove low-effort political self-posts.

Yes and yes. >but we have fallen short because we don't have enough active moderators. We would need to hire more. The problem is we need to find people who have the time and inclination to do this.

Any other conditions? Wheeee flairs!!   
TIL, LPT/jugaad, ELI 5, ITAP, TOMT, throwback for old awesome posts that newcomers can enjoy like out of loop.     

But can we also have something against down voting self posts into oblivion?     
 [removed] You people tried to moderate political thread last time as well it didn't work. Politics is the major subject on this sub and unless you double the moderators keeping political posts strictly r enforced will be hard.  [removed] Having to explain memes kind of spoil the fun. And that also kind of deters the content makes (Who am I kidding, no randian makes original content). Even then, atleast its possible in the future. Aand thats how you make a dead sub...btw instead of these useless flairs why not make a ""Delhi"" flair to filter it out all the useless AAP posts. I have a moderation related questions.   

When Moderators delete a post, I have seen 3 kinds of things happening.

1. A comment is posted to the thread about why it was deleted   
2. A [deleted] message appear on the self post    
3. Sometimes neither of the 2 happen, but the post still disappears.    

So what's the difference? Why not a message in the thread any time a post is deleted by moderation?   
 Add a flair for geopolitics.  AskIndia is good but I don't think Governance flair would be used often. Rather, have a Weekly flair for regular posts. Another suggestion, have a BJP/AAP/Congress flair along with Political. A lot of people want to read political news not related to these 3 parties.  Rules rules and more rules....At this rate One day you will have to delete all political posts and move it r/IndianPolitics  > No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter. 

no direct submission to posts made by verified twitter handles makes no sense. make this rule about unverified twitter handles.

verified twitter handles serve as news source, and you have policy of not editing the news headlines, but you want users to editorialize  the 140 character twitter posts. That defeats the purpose of twitter, as a platform.

 Please could you add a crime flair. We get quite a few of those posts, and one for the counselling needed type relationship posts.

How do you define low-effort political self posts? Also what about low-effort political comments in political posts? Can you guys have the automod say which words are censored from the sub so that when my comments get deleted I can remove the offensive words? Thx Mods can you bring back the weekly movies thread

They were being done earlier but then were disbanded dues to lack of popularity after some time

Now with the whole make /r/india better thing going on

I think it would be good time to bring them back, and see how they work now

Plus it would also increase semi-Original Content and NP posts

Maybe stickie those threads early on Whenever we have one of these posts, it is followed by another list of new rules. Can we just let things be for a while?  Please bring up new ways to help new redditers  [deleted] IMHO, you guys need to cut down on your stupid rules, instead of making shitty new ones. 

You guys remind me of the following story:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_miller,_his_son_and_the_donkey I can pitch in as mod and help out if you guys are okay with that. 

Edit: just saw the comment by the mods regarding signing up. Will modmail.  - Regarding ""no direct submission to images"" for [P] posts, could you please clarify the reasoning behind this idea? Doing away with memes and ""caption this"" makes sense, but why all images? For example, would an image of a politician slapping someone not be relevant content which would not require any further explanation? Additionally, if you do decide to go ahead with it, why just images and not audio/video?

- Could you clarify what a ""low-effort"" political self-post would be? Would all such content need to be backed up by data or are opinion pieces also allowed? If data is to be made mandatory, how would you plan to make sure that the content isn't an op piece with some data just for the sake of sticking to the rules? [deleted] ""Governance"" flair is an interesting idea. Not sure how much traction it will get but it's worth a shot. There is a very urgent need to separate political bullshit and rhetoric from actual impactful decisions that political parties are taking.  I am very against these ideas of writing essay for self posts. I have already expressed my opinion [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3d8epc/is_noise_drowning_out_the_signal_in_rindia/ct2to3p):

> and low-effort content is always upvoted to the top

subjective. people upvote what they like

> Remove low-effort political self-posts.
> 
> No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter.

it's censorship. mods shouldn't decide what is 'low-effort' and what is not. the members of community should.

and not everyone wants to read a essay about why submitted an image of some tweet. 

>  /r/India should not be the place to discuss WhatsApp forwards.

People like it. Let them decide what they want by uproots/downvotes.

 We need more flairs. Arts, Movies, Books, TV, etc etc. 

We need weekly threads for different topics. Can we automate this please?  Be more strict with with titles which are unverified and misleading. I see them not tagged Wrt flairs.

Try and choose a flair which is a unique set with minimal Overlap and a topic obvious from the name.

So for example governance could be policy. Entertainment I think would be too broad.

Sports is a good choice. I think DIY maybe of value. Ask is another option.  Please take care of posts which are low effort under political flair. Don't let them shitpost. For example like today 

Really low effort & shit post

> https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3dlxn8/proof_that_rss_is_literally_hitler/

One line statements from Twitter which creates cicrle-jerk

> https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3dlo0y/tell_narendramodi_to_remove_his_paramilitary_from/

Rather ask such people to make self posts or wait till any media house writes a full article on this. What is the point in creating multiple threads due to just one comment from any politician?

As we are growing, we are lacking space on the front page, news & politics keep on clogging up that space.

Please don't resent anything & be harsh on these assholes. You have my vote on this.

Please bring more flairs other than AskIndia/HelpIndia like Sports & Entertainment. Please have more weekly threads like those tech threads & also sticky those threads so more people comment. Thanks for taking the initiative, the new flairs sound like a good idea, implementing them, a far bigger proposition, but doable!!    
>Political discussions should be strictly [R] enforced         

This needs to be done. I know it is a big task for the mods, but its the need of the hour! You can find people who are actually driven to do this, and if implemented,along with removal of low effort self posts, will be a welcome respite, and greatly improve the quality of political discourse in the sub.    

Again thanks for trying to bring about a change and I wish you guys all the luck to go through with it. you'll need it :) Could we limit the posts with personal questions and rants? They're almost always unverified, troll bait and conform to the subs circlejerks.

I'd love to see more moderation of those posts than deleting ""Chaddis vs AAPtards"" kind of comments. The latter get downvoted pretty often, anyway. Could you post some guidelines about downvoting that people will see more prominently when they are about to downvote?

Right now whenever someone sees something they don't agree with, it is downvoted to oblivion and it fosters a kind of circlejerk where you only see the majority opinion and anything that disagrees just disappears.

Other options might include keeping the threads in contest mode for a longer time. I used to avoid /r/India like the plague, but now I'm starting to see a lot of intriguing discussions. I still disagree with some people, but we are able to discuss in a logical and informed manner, as opposed to the childish, irrational, and chauvinist way people were a while back.

Re-subscribed. 1. Strictly objective rules. Remove all subjective interpretation from rules. This continues the situation of ""we have fallen short"" remark. When there is no objectivity, two people can have a different opinion about the same comment, and then a rule ceases to be a rule and becomes an opinion. 
2. Self posts for images. Well, there is already a work-around and loophole in current rules where users can post a collage of more than one twitter screenshot and not use exact title rule. Self post provides an easier editorializing of the title. Exactly how will this help reducing shitpost is unclear to me. 
3. New common account that is purely for communication. Does this mean you are now willing to discuss controversial mod decisions in public? This will help the community to understand the thought that went behind deleting some comment or thread and what was the subjective reasoning used? Unless subjective decisions are discussed and debated, these rules are just anchors of imposing your opinion on mod activities. Any comment can be constructed to violate any random rule because ""I felt so"" without any accountability to the community! Modmail is just a safety net because you are afraid that you may have been wrong and 15 people collectively pouncing on one person is better that 300+ people pouncing on the mods for a wrong decision.  Media,Random,Other.


I guess these will be cool flairs. [deleted] Good points...personally, am in complete agreement  *AskIndia*   *Governance*  what do this flairs even mean? 

And how am I suppose to make a self post on a meme in NP category? Defeats the purpose of Memes doesn't it? Thought this place would be more open and free. Definitely need a Political sub and also rules 'only where needed'.  [deleted] >Remove low-effort political self-posts.

Who is going to decide this ?
As it is, there is already too much censorship in a so called platform for free speech. Request:Can politics/religion related posts (I put those two because they are closely linked) be moved to /r/IndiaPolitics or /r/IndianPolitics or whatever that sub is? Would be nice to have more music related posts. Especially folk music from different parts of the country. Please ban twitter and facebook from unverified accounts altogether. Even the ""screenshot+blur"" thing is ridiculous. Self posts with an actual argument that quotes statements from known but unverified officials (i.e. legit public figures who don't have the mark of verification) should be allowed. >Political discussions should be strictly [R] enforced.

And yet you have trolls calling the PM a faggot. How about a [Health] or [Medicine] flair as well? Indians can do with some evidence based medicine. > No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter.   

I agree with twitter restriction and most of twitter posts are again self-posts without any explanation behind them^Swamy. But, memes keeps the sub interesting. Some of the memes are shit, but I have seen some amusing ones that are randian's creativity.   


> Remove low-effort political self-posts.   

What is low-effort? [Lame] for worthless discussions going on here. 

And on a serious note, I think we need [Humor] or [Satire] or something on sort of similar lines. How about Reli[G]ious Start a [Gender issues] flair
India is boiling pot of gender issues with reservation for women to fake cases by women ."
34,AskIndia,"Older, more experienced people of India: What will actually happen if I marry outside my caste?",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4qepvz/older_more_experienced_people_of_india_what_will/,"Reposting from [here](https://yy.reddit.com/r/AskIndia/comments/4qazaw/what_will_actually_happen_if_i_marry_outside_my/)

I am a 26 year old guy in love with my girlfriend from college in India. Both of us are working outside India in the same city. I am from Rajasthan and from Agarwal community. My girlfriend is belongs to a scheduled caste and is from Maharashtra. Both of us obviously don't care about the caste system.

Now my parents are against our relationship. They hate SC people in general. Some of the reasons they are opposing the marriage 

1. It will tarnish their prestige.
2. It will lower their standing in the community.
3. It will be difficult to find a match for my younger sister (7 years younger)
4. My entire extended family has hopes from me. (I don't understand this one either :P)
5. I don't know the best for me, they do.

Now I understand that they are orthodox and probably had dreams about my future wife. I don't expect them to change their views quickly (may be they never will).

What I actually want to know in case they never accept my girlfriend and I decide to marry her:

1. Will it really affect my sister's wedding?
2. What is ""standing in the society"", or ""prestige"". Do these things actually take a beating?

"," >Will it really affect my sister's wedding?

It might if the people from your community are really hell bent on being orthodox & backward. 

>What is ""standing in the society"", or ""prestige"". Do these things actually take a beating?

These things are a state of mind according to me. If any family is economically secure then it should not give two cents about what people think or what people might say.  

My personal experience: I married a girl from lower caste community who is also my long time friend (both of us are Maharashtrians) My parents were cool about it but her parents were hell bent on breaking us apart & emotionally tortured my GF but she is amazingly strong & did not give up. There reasons were also the same as everyone gives, i.e. what will people say, we will not be able to face the community. Eventually her parents agreed for marriage(took 1 year to convince) & after 2 years I think her parents have slowly started to realize that it was right decision. 

At the end it is up to you if you want to go through the possible emotional atyachar of an inter caste marriage(which is obviously the great story to tell to your grand kids) or have a plain socially approved arranged marriage. I did intercaste adventurous (atleast to me) marriage. My wife is tambram and i am not. 
There will be problems and bitter feelings initially. 
Your first task should be to make babies (not joking here). That can settle down the dust. Also after you marry stay out of sight for some years.  Why? 
If you stay locally then you both have to visit relatives weddings etc that can cause frictions and can upset your wife if your relatives say something ridiculous. 

Stand up for yourself. This is your life. Don't let some 500 year old tradition drive your life. 

Good luck! 

Edit: stay out of sight = go back to foreign country again?  > Will it really affect my sister's wedding?

If arranged marriage, it will effect in the sense there would be some assholes who wouldn't want to get married into your family. But do note that your sister is better off not getting married to an asshole of a family.

> What is ""standing in the society"", or ""prestige"". Do these things actually take a beating?

This is a tough question. I can give only my view based on anecdotal evidence - do note that I live in urban area is south India.

It frankly depends on extended family. In the inter caste marriages I have seen, one girl's parents were boycotted by extended family for around 2-3 years. Petty snarky remarks in family functions, not attending wedding, avoid meeting etc. Her husband's family (except his mother) came around and rallied around the couple. In another couple I know, the guys parents are still pissed off (5 years now) but it was more because of love marriage rather than arranged. His parents/extended aunty club cribs on not following certain customs (like wearing mangalsutra), skin color etc.

So if your mom/dad care a lot for what the extended family thinks of them and/or the extended family is their primary social circle, and the social circle is casteist, their ""prestige"" can take a beating. However, you are an adult and you have to live your decision. I can't answer this question. But you may want to put in a serious or reddiquette tag if you are serious about non-trolling answers.  If someone is rejecting your sister because you married outside your caste then she shouldn't be marrying the guy anyway.

Just my .02 rupee. Here is what i think , I think you are making a mistake. Leave her now.

Here is why?

If you wanted to be with that girl , absolutely none of the objections you have raised would matter. No one and i mean no one has a right on your future life. You and your partner have to be the only ones to decide. So even by asking the question and in the tone you have asked, i posit that you are not really into her.

Drop it now, not for the reasons you suggest but because you are not into her.


 Honor Killing is a possibility... They'll hack you and your wife into pieces and feed them to the ~~goats~~ gaus.. 

But seriously.. Fuck the orthodoxy.. If you want Indian society to progress you need to break away from useless traditions and mindsets which your family unfortunately still apparently follows.. 

Screw your parents.. (Not literally).. Your sister will be fine.. Its not like she's gonna be married the next day of your own marriage.. 

Chill..Marry...Repent..  Evaluate the fact if the girl is really the one. If the answer is yes, other things don't matter. 

Time heals everything and when your parents/relatives realize that you made a good choice they will reconsider their position.  Editing a few spelling mistakes. > Will it really affect my sister's wedding?

Yes it will, Rajasthan in particular is a bitch about this. Both my sisters are Married out of community and trust me most of the family outright reject meeting my Dad because of this (I am not pushing for Marriage, my dad has no timepass so he is busy wasting his time on getting an arranged wedding done.). But the ones who do get ready fall into two bunch, one who are genuinely nice and progressive people and the second bunch who think this will be way of getting extra dowry from the brides family. So that's that. If you think you sister can find a or wants to find a partner on her own, then don't worry.

> What is ""standing in the society"", or ""prestige"". Do these things actually take a beating?

Asshat from the community will bitch about it for the first few years, after that everyone shuts up once they find out how well the couple is doing. If you are confident you will end up in strong marriage with your GF then do go ahead and not let the Samaj bother you. If you are both outside India, then why don't you marry there. Nobody will really care in a few years."
35,AskIndia,[R]Feedback thread the sequel. Results and announcements.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2o2rpl/rfeedback_thread_the_sequel_results_and/,"Dear Subscribers,

Thank you for all the comments and thoughts on the feedback thread. Based on that here are the most popular suggestions and our decisions

**Edit** - **check out the clarification about user's posting history, please**

* Bring back old “United We Stand Banner” - **done**

* New link flairs  to be introduced - 

   * Old article (older than 6 months)

   * Technology (phone reviews)

   * Arts (bollywood, music, books, poetry)

   * Finance

  * Twitter

  * Sports

  * AskIndia


* Clarification on Flairs: User flairs have been enabled for a few months now. Just a reminder though, any flair which breaks the css or the reddit default format will be removed. Any flair that targets individuals will be removed. 

* Score hiding - **This is a reddit feature which hides votes/total score for a set interval. Since we're constantly the target of voting brigades, we'll be hiding scores for an hour to break up the voting patterns and make sure that comments are voted purely on the basis of merit. Scores will be hidden for 60 minutes. Subscribers will still be able to see the scores on their comments.**

* Selecting the next moderator - **Since we need a new mod in the near future, we will ask for people to sign up/nominate themselves. We will then create a shortlist and let /r/india debate on the people in the list. Expect more details in a separate thread.**

* About ScoopWhoop/Storify/Buzzfeed - **looks like these sites have now gotten mainstream with a lot of non-spammy users submitting links from them. Please use voting to keep clickbaits down and we will ban new spam sites.**

* Repost removal policy - **all reposts/same news will be directed to the first post it's category. The repost window will be 4 hours long**

* Personal Attack Rule Review - **No change. The community is a lot better since we undertook all the trouble to cut out the slurs. We'll keep this rule going for now**. 

* Can bringing up a user's posting history be classified as a personal attack? **Yes.** 

**Edit** - As long as you bring up the history of the person you're actually talking to - and not name drop some other redditor it won't count as a personal attack.


* Cross Posting: You may cross post threads in the line of /r/bestof, but anything even borderline /r/subredditdrama will be removed without hesitation. Additionally cross posting from /r/pakistan in comments or as posts is banned on /r/india on the subreddit's request. Please keep other subs' rules in mind before posting here. For instance /r/polandball does not allow xposts to communities as large as ours.

Additionally, please bring your objections to modmail, because we will not allow any negative community meta or drama posts. The place to ask for removal clarifications is modmail not the subreddit. We respond to the best of our abilities and fast as we can, excuse any delays on weekends and holidays etc. Please also note that in some cases there are delays because the mod in question might go offline thanks to timezones. 

Thanks!
"," what about flair for **science** lets discuss science articles also , it will be very useful for learning new things  [deleted] >but anything even borderline /r/subredditdrama will be removed without hesitation

This is quite a violation, no?

I'm sure you will say that if you want to critique, bring it up within /r/india and not outside? But /r/subredditdrama can, while indulging in schadenfreude, still keep us on our toes instead of giving one the feeling that critique is being swept under the carpet. [deleted] I have hidden the score for 60 minutes for now, but I believe given the traffic in /r/India the comment scores should be hidden for 120 minutes. Thoughts? Can the OP be Highlighted more clearly? Its just a more saturated blue, which isn't easy to figure out. For example, most subs have a Blue Background box behind OP name when submitting comments. Can we at least get some Indian mods? Someone who respects Indian sensibilities? Someone who understands, recognises and agrees with the democratic opinion of the country? 

Actually, I know the answer. Take it up your own modmail. 
 > * Clarification on Flairs

This clarification has been a long time coming. You should have given this clarification *before* banning people from the sub for it. Anyways, better late than never.

> * Score hiding
> * New moderator
> * Repost removal

All good steps. I congratulate the mod team. Why has this thread been posted so late in the night?

Wouldn't the more logical thing be to post it during India hours when most active subscribers are awake? > Since we need a new mod in the near future, we will ask for people to sign up/nominate themselves. We will be holding elections in a few weeks.

So someone like hindusanghi123 will be the next mod now? > Personal Attack Rule Review - No change. The community is a lot better since we undertook all the trouble to cut out the slurs. We'll keep this rule going for now.
 
Nope. It's become a lot more intolerant community which believes in violently criticizing groups of people or people in public but cannot take a personal insult when called to question on it. If you delight in shaming people you don't know from the comforts of your keyboard, it'd be hypocritic not to be ready to take insults in return.

> Can bringing up a user's posting history be classified as a personal attack? Yes.

Bullshit. So is the unverified twitter account rule.

> Cross Posting: You may cross post threads in the line of /r/bestof , but anything even borderline /r/subredditdrama will be removed without hesitation. Additionally cross posting from /r/pakistan in comments or as posts is banned on /r/india on the subreddit's request. Please keep other subs' rules in mind before posting here.

Can (and is) abused. Use Meta flair for this.

> Score hiding

The crappiest parochial thought fart someone ever had.

> About ScoopWhoop/Storify/Buzzfeed

What's the problem with them? Bad titling?

> Additionally, please bring your objections to modmail, because we will not allow any negative community meta or drama posts. The place to ask for removal clarifications is modmail not the subreddit

Absolutely no point to this. Leave it to the user's intelligence.

Adding a question, why is **pure theology** as /u/rahulthewall puts it is **banned** in this subreddit? Isn't this also a sub where history is discussed. A verse of the Rig Veda was banned while an article talking about Hindu mythology in medium.com was allowed. Clarify your stand. If you're supporting banning it in the future, that's stupid.

The twitter flair is a nice idea BTW. score hiding will be awesome. good job mods!

ps. would never want to become mod. too much hardwork. you guys are good keep it up Can you put multiple flairs on the same post? i.e. if I post an article which is more than 6 months old about a political subject - what should I flair it as?   

What if it's a Twitter comment which is political and more than 6 months old?   
 >Can bringing up a user's posting history be classified as a personal attack? Yes.

Bad

>but anything even borderline /r/subredditdrama

Bad

>For instance /r/polandball[6] does not allow xposts to communities as large as ours.

Bad.

Everything else sounds great.
 [deleted] Points are still visible on mobile or if you disable CSS, right?  Are you guys still taking the feedback? If yes then I suggest to NOT include AskIndia flair but instead redirect those to /r/AskIndia. Like /r/europe has on the top.

Also sometimes exact title rule doesn't really tell what is in the article. So for that something like *editorialized* flair should be there.

And now some queries - how much time should we wait for the mods to respond if the modmail is sent? Does *Repost removal policy* apply only to that article from one source or other sources too? Because different sources have difference in how the story is presented >About ScoopWhoop/Storify/Buzzfeed - looks like these sites have now gotten mainstream with a lot of non-spammy users submitting links from them. Please use voting to keep clickbaits down and we will ban new spam sites.

You don't have to ban all links from these sites. Just the ones that have embedded YouTube/Vimeo videos. 

Also, could you guys have AutoMod notify us every time a comment that breaks the rule is deleted. I use c*unt a lot, and it seems to be a word that is monitored closely. Often I've noticed that my comments carrying the word get deleted even when used in a non-sexist or satirical context. I would like to know if/when any of my comments are deleted. I don't see what's wrong with it.  Thanks for the flairs!

Edit: I still see two flairs only. Not activated yet?

Edit 2: Ah I see.  > Personal Attack Rule Review - No change. The community is a lot better since we undertook all the trouble to cut out the slurs. We'll keep this rule going for now.

> **Can bringing up a user's posting history be classified as a personal 
attack? Yes.** 

What the fuck? May I know when are you going to ban words like ""kulcha"" and ""kulcha warriors"" ???  Thanks for the change.  > New link flairs to be introduced -

No kulcha flair? Nice Work , When it will be done ? > We respond to the best of our abilities and fast as we can, excuse any delays on weekends and holidays etc

What about those cases in which no reply is received even after several reminders?

> please bring your objections to modmail, because we will not allow any negative community meta or drama posts. 

Again, you only pick and reply. The community should know if the mods are showing partisanship. 

> Is bringing up a user's posting history can be classified as a personal attack? Yes.

So basically I'm allowed to say one thing today and say something completely opposite tomorrow? > We will then create a shortlist and let /r/india[1] debate

What will be the criteria to select this shortlist? Thanks for the link flairs! That was required. 

Score hiding for an hour is good too. Please extend that to comment scores as well. 

 >New link flairs to be introduced -

Old article (older than 6 months)
Technology (phone reviews)
Arts (bollywood, music, books, poetry)
Finance
Twitter
Sports
AskIndia

Could we have a ""Uplifting News"" flair? I have been requesting for this for a while! Plis to include me on mod nomination plij.

I think this sub can use a right of center mod. :P

 >  Any flair that targets individuals will be removed. 

Can a person abuse himself/herself in the flair? My flair e.g. All I have to say is, please make sure the next mod is not a liberal. ALL of the mods are liberal as of now. Approved  Can we have some information about RTI in the /r/india wiki?


Also why 

> cross posting from /r/pakistan in comments or as posts is banned on /r/india




 Still zero feedback for why the mods seem terrified or simply unwilling to take any action against certain posters of a 'secular'/Leftist political bias with a habit of targeting others and the r/india community as a whole.

Are these posters mods or admins? Is that why they are completely immune and get a blank check to do whatever they like? Please clarify.  BTW mods, I'd appreciate if you applied the 'won't show downvotes' rule for new threads as well, because me and other posters identified as 'bhakts' or 'Sanghis' have been facing very furious and concerted downvote herding from r/india's 'secular' posters and lurkers. 

Every new thread I've posted in the last couple of weeks has been quickly downvoted to keep its score near 0 and usually certain posters keep topping that up every few minutes to ensure it never gets more than a few total votes and stays far off the front page.

36,AskIndia,[Mod Post] Introducing new flairs for better organization of content.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3ecyjp/mod_post_introducing_new_flairs_for_better/,"Dear subscribers,

A week ago we requested for feedback on introduction of new flairs for better organization of content and your consumption. We have deliberated on your feedback and we now support new flairs.

* **Sports, Technology, Food** - The title of these flairs are self-explanatory.
* **Scheduled** - This flair will be associated for regular threads like RDD, Books, Movies etc. The introduction of this flair is to encourage more such weekly threads by our subscribers. We would love to see regular threads on our sub.
* **Ask India** - This flair relates to any question that you'd like to ask the r/India community. For example, arranged marriages or which positions to have best sexual stimulations.
* **Governance** - Recently, our subscribers played a big role in Net Neutrality and tried to shape country wide public policy on the Internet. We would like to see more such traction on different fronts.  However, please note that this flair is specifically for public policy related decisions. **Each post with the Governance flair should be a self-post ONLY.**

We hope these new flairs help better consume and organize content. We would love to see more posts from our vibrant community.

Cheers!

---

**Suggestions on the following topics are welcome**

* Colour Codes for the flair (in case you have better suggestions or an overall theme look in mind)
* More Flair Categories

---

**Note:** We are aware of the CSS discrepancies at this stage (flair selector list is a little messed up and missing buttons in the sidebar). We would add these soon. 

---

**Edit:** We renamed the Regular flair to Scheduled to better reflect the purpose of the flair."," [deleted] Yo. Team, I think we need to explain governance better, or force it to have a submission statement to raise the bar for the discussion. You have introduced new flairs. But how do you sort based on them? I see only 6 categories on the right... More Flair Categories: TIL, History/Philosophy/Literature, LongReads, Entertainment/Arts

Color Scheme for flairs: Similar to r/science or r/technology

Theme: Even r/Bharat a mature sub, has vibrant colors, our theme is dull, should have colors which looks interactive. > Governance - Recently, our subscribers played a big role in Net Neutrality and tried to shape country wide public policy on the Internet.

It's such a relief from the regular political bashing. A job well done dear mods! Can we have a flair for Defence ? To club news related to defence, intelligence and strategy ? Can we get an '**Entertainment**' flair for posting Bollywood related stuff? I suggest including a ""health"" flair.  we need a new flair to tag all the Twitter posts.
I want to filter them all out! Niyam kanoon toh thik hai, pehle is post ko sticky toh kar do. > Ask India - For example, arranged marriages or which positions to have best sexual stimulations

Yeah and not just the subreddit.  For /r/india's 13000+ members ,very less number of people actually comment on posts or post anything .

My wild guess is ,people refrain from posting because as soon as you make a comment/post :

-Someone will oppose you just for the sake of it on the basis of million odd technicalities. 

-Some douche will start correcting your English.(Some kids relate your poor English skills with your opinion on that issue.)

-You might run into risk of hurting sensibilities of 'Seculars' or 'Hindutvas'. And ,then its all about jumping on conclusions to prove points.

-You might break one of those sub-reddit rules.

or

-You don't have anything to say or don't give a fuck about the issue.

On an average, on each post ,there are two redditors slugging it out over the most ridiculous things. 

Thats why /r/india resembles /r/worldnews . Its all about posting some news,then start bashing Indian society & how things are fucked up . Lekin agar woh bhi nahi kar sake, toh bring in Modi Vs. Gandhi debate,& you are good to go.

If we could just tone down our condescending attitudes,maybe more people will start contributing on /r/india. Now what is seen is comments of same set of people on almost every post. that's exactly the problem with India,we have schemes and schemes of things,but no follow up to the end. /r/kannada Rarely Active?

42,AskIndia,Bill Gates' thoughts on Climate change and India's Role in it.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3wcid0/bill_gates_thoughts_on_climate_change_and_indias/,"He thinks that asking India to switch to cleaner and costlier energy is unfair. The developed world should take the initiative, dramatically increase investment in Energy R&D and come up with cheaper alternatives that are sustainable for developing economies like ours. 
Here's the excerpt from his interview with The Atlantic. 
>..when you turn to India and say, “Please cut your carbon emissions, and do it with energy that’s really expensive, subsidized energy,” that’s really putting them in a tough position, because energy for them means a kid can read at night, or having an air conditioner or a refrigerator, or being able to eat fresh foods, or get to your job, or buy fertilizer.

>I’m a big believer in foreign aid, but the climate problem has to be solved in the rich countries. China and the U.S. and Europe have to solve CO2 emissions, and when they do, hopefully they’ll make it cheap enough for everyone else. But the big numbers are all in the developed economies, where China’s defined into that term.

> I want to call up India someday and say, “Here’s a source of energy that is cheaper than your coal plants, and by the way, from a global-pollution and local-pollution point of view, it’s also better.”


[Full interview here](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/11/we-need-an-energy-miracle/407881/) It's worth a read. "," You liked what he said? Twit to him and let him know about that. Bill Gates is an admirable brilliant character, unlike his late counterpart in another company. You know who... What if there is no renewable technology that is cheaper than coal? Should we say ""oh well, the free market didn't solve it, therefore let's all die in 60 years"". Carbon has a cost; we will end up paying it one way or another.

And obviously the west should do more. The biggest hurdle to combating Climate change from the West is the republicans that still in denial mode. And the powerful oil+gas lobbies. I wouldn't be surprised if their money funds cutting nuclear research, and many anti-nuclear activists.

It's kinda sad that he considers China a developed country that should be taking the lead on climate change and India a poor developing country, but that's reality I guess.

It's also important to remember that The Atlantic caters to a US liberal audience who are hugely upset by the climate denying crazies in the American right - India's problems are a distant concern. But to us in India the pollution levels are WORSE than China, so we should do more than be complacent. Throwing our arms in the air and going ""the west needs to fix it, not our problem"", is ultimately self-defeating.

But yes of course, the West needs to share renewable research and help out developing nations too."

I am a salaried software engineer in Bangalore, but I'm also getting offers for freelance stuff. I am mulling over a few of these.

One of them seems promising. Three dudes in US are asking me to help bootstrap their startup, and I think I'd take this one.

They are willing to pay me $1000-$2000 for a month of initial work. There's also a possibility of getting more work if they get seed funding.

I am worried about the tax return filing next year. Up until now, I have only filed ITR based on Form-16 from employer. Never had to worry about foreign payment for services provided.

Should I file ITR-4 in 2018? 

Or can I just mention it as ""income from other sources"" under ITR-1?

They are also willing to offer me some equity. Don't know how international equity compliance works, so if any of you have any experience, that would be helpful.

I am sure there are plenty of you folks here who have faced a similar situation. I google a lot (my google-foo isn't that good), and posted in some CA forum, but no reply.

This video does an amazing job of explaining the problem with fpps. 

There are several alternatives to it, some are linked in that video itself.

Fpps is considered to be one of the worst system of elections and you can trace many of our problems to it. 

Edit: some of the alternatives are alternate vote and single transferable vote.  Fpps is the system in which the candidate with the most number of votes wins, regardless of the number of votes. 
For eg, there are 9 candidates in an election. One gets 12% and each of the others get 11%. The one with 12%will win the election since he has the highest number of votes despite his share being very low. 

This was the system followed in Britain at the time of Indian independence. That and the simplicity of the system led the makers of the Constitution to adopt it.

PS:X-Post from r/AskIndia"," They do accept , provided you have an excellent academic record along with other things to show , like research papers , RA etc. The acceptance rates are very low though.

If you consider swiss uni. like ETHZ , they also ask for course material you referred so that you meet the academic standards/background they expect. I assume it's something similar in Germany. US universities generally accept any 4 year course if you want to apply for MS/MS+Phd. They look at your academic record and GRE scores.

Getting into top-end universities is extremely hard though and there is a lot of competition from all over the world. If you want full scholarship (this is usually given to MS+PhD students) the competition is just insane for places like MIT/Stanford.

I'm not 100% sure about Germany but the UK accepts Indian 3 year undergraduate programs (except medicine, you need to sit for PLAB). I'd imagine germany is similar to UK. I just saw this on my FB feed about PhD in Germany. Check if you find anything useful. DAAD, a student exchange programme between India and Germany, hosts many webinars and expos.

51,AskIndia,The long and fascinating story of how Dadra and Nagar Haveli got integrated into India.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/25ix5m/the_long_and_fascinating_story_of_how_dadra_and/,"India is a big, complicated country with a big, complicated history. This means that any reasonably efficient attempt at trying to make sense of Indian history must, unfortunately, gloss over the hundreds of thousands of little stories that went into making modern India. Take, for instance, the liberation of Dadra and Nagar Haveli.

> *""On the night of July 22, 1954, a group of nearly fifteen volunteers of the United Front of Goans (UFG) under the leadership of freedom fighters Francis Mascarenhas and Vaman Desai assembled outside the border to discuss the details of the assault. They marched across the border and approached Dadra, around midnight. When they neared the police station, they recognised sub-inspector Aniceto Rosario, their archenemy. He was responsible for the ill treatment of UFG members in the police custody at Daman and they sought revenge. At that time, he was addressing a group of 100 to 150 villagers; warning them against the illegal entry by outsiders through their fields. They were also told that disobeying the orders would be met with serious consequences. The volunteers managed to crawl into the village, while some of them mixed with the locals assembled at the meeting. The remaining went round and began to close in from behind the police station.""*

Much violence followed. More [here](http://www.navhindtimes.in/ilive/how-18th-june-road-got-its-name). And in this newspaper clipping [here](http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&dat=19540724&id=wXUjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=sL4EAAAAIBAJ&pg=5673,3493515).

Two weeks later Nagar Haveli was also captured, and the liberators declared that the little enclave was now ""Free Dadra And Nagar Haveli"", an independent country, with no international recognition of course, but run by a pro-Indian government called the Varishtha Panchayat. Some time afterwards the Panchayat asked India for help to run the enclave. 
> *""In response to requests from the Varishta Panchayat and the Administrator of Nagar-Aveli, Dr. A. Furtado, who proposed to resign, the Government of India agreed to make available the services of a senior officer of the Indian Administrative Service as the Administrator of those areas. Shri K. G. Badlani took over as the new Administrator with effect from 17 October 1960. It is also proposed to elect a new Panchayat to replace the present Panchayat which consists of nominees. This new Panchayat would act as the Legislative Council of the liberated areas.""*

From this Ministry of External Affairs report [here](http://mealib.nic.in/?pdf2487?000). (PDF)

Meanwhile the Portuguese government took India to the International Court of Justice. The court passed a judgement that upheld the Portuguese claim that its sovereign territory had been over-run, but then curiously passed another judgement that prevented the Portuguese from actually doing anything about the Indian 'invasion'.  Copy of the judgement [here](http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/32/4521.pdf). (PDF)

Understandably, both countries insisted that the ruling went in their respective favour.

Thus for seven years, from 1954 to 1961, Free Dadra and Nagar Haveli existed in a state of political limbo, nicely helped along by the government of India and Mr. Badlani.

And then in 1961, after Portuguese India had fallen and been annexed by Indian forces, D&NH requested to be merged with India. The popular telling of what happened next is as follows: D&NH quickly created a legislature, that then elected IAS officer KG Badlani as Prime Minister of Dadra and Nagar Haveli for just one day. That same day he signed over the territory to the Republic of India. And this handover was formalized with the tenth amendment to the Indian Constitution. Amendment details [here](http://mail01.tinyletterapp.com/NowHereThis/now-here-this-6/1076673-164.100.47.134/intranet/cai/a.pdf?c=66b2a0b7-a1c6-4faa-8c15-2659fdd94b72). (PDF)

I've not been able to source any documents to suggest that Badlani was actually made a ""Prime Minister For A Day"". But there is little doubt that he was, if only briefly, the head of state of a tiny little quasi-independent enclave in India before it was gobbled up by the republic.

And thus, my email-friends, was a nation built.

Source - [Sidin Vadakut's Newsletter](http://tinyletter.com/NowHereThis)

No way, likes of chaddichandan gang or any Indian company has built ""Arogya Setu"" app"," Where'd you get the info for point 4? > It aims to support all languages in the world(e.g Russian, Japanese, Chinese)

There's nothing wrong with extensive localisation, allows your app to reach a wider target audience.

>Code is obfuscated

Pretty standard practice, atleast on the web. You obfuscate your code when you don't want people to find out what your code does, so that people have difficulty understanding and cloning it (I suppose).

>Someone seems to have changed package name to nic.goi.aarogyasetu and sold it to our government for 100000 USD?

What makes you think government directly hired someone for the job. They simply contacted someone who could do it and paid them to do it. https://internetfreedom.in/a-comprehensive-look-at-covid-surveillance-and-privacy-in-india/

Pg 59 of the Working Paper talks about Arogya Setu App. How is the app supposed to know if you have been in contact with a COVID-19 patient if your screen is off, Bluetooth pairing is not automatic (so it can find devices that are amber or red in risk status) and if it wants to save your precise location for track back? By Magic? i am a big sceptic of this government and the invasion of privacy with this app.

i was dead against it until I saw the Vox video about the success S Korea had with contact tracing. they were one of the frontrunners of this pandemic in March but have flattened the curve remarkably well with exhaustive testing and contact tracing. Heck, i think India has more cases than them, now.

Contact tracing becomes even more critical in india given the idiots who are using this lockdown period to go play cricket.

as much as i hate this app, i have still installed it and hope many folks do so, too. i know I can uninstall when this SARS-COV-2 threat is behind us.

as /u/DrunkZooKeeper has said, these invasive permissions are required to build a social map and understand who has been in the same vicinity as someone who's tested positive. 

how else would you know whether you have crossed paths with an infected person at your local sabzi mandi?

folks, i can completely understand your discomfort and scepticism. i fight that battle internally every day. but an app like this works only if we have a large enough population using it. suspend your anger (as correct as it is to have it) temporarily. 

the need of the hour is to give as much useful information as possible to central authorities so that they have adequate data on which to base decisions.

please do consider installing and self-testing in this app. please do have everyone who will be in close proximity to you in the days to come understand this app and have them consider installing it.

this is the only (pardon me) diya we have while fighting this battle in a dark, dark room. In UAE we have TRACECOVID app, same functionality.

53,AskIndia,"[AskIndia] Why is ""corona virus"" death rate steadily increasing?",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g0lz8i/askindia_why_is_corona_virus_death_rate_steadily/,"When I started tracking corona virus in ""worldometers"" website, the death rate was merely 3%, it became 4% in a week and now I see corona death rate have increased to 6.2%.

If HCQ/Remdesivir/*Cinchona Officinalis* can cure corona, how could the corona virus death rate double in few week's time?

## "," When the mortality rate is so high, it only means that we aren't testing as widely as required. While we are capturing all the deaths in the data, we're nowhere close to capturing the actual infection numbers. 

Also, everyone who caught the virus before the lockdown, would be either dying or recovering right about now. Assuming 5% mortality and 60% mild cases, in 100 people who we didn't test or report, we miss 5 deaths but miss 60 recoveries which can skew up the ratio.

 I'm by no means saying the percentages which I mentioned are accurate, just example. Community spread + lack of proper health structure + lack of testing per 1 mil ppl Because it's just the beginning. We will never know actual death rate until we happen to stabilize the spread. Even if you test positive, what can a doctor do? Because we aren't testing everyone, we aren't getting many negative cases. Plus some people who died with pneumonia were tested for Corona and it came out as positive. Paracetamol is not in the same league - only for fever so lets set it aside. And whatever else you are mentioning are therapies - not vaccines. They are yet to be proved clinically with trials. Please Google how clinical trials are performed for any vaccine or a drug. Just because HCQ is approved for X disorder doesn't make it eligible for Covid19.

And you are talking about death rate of which place specifically ?  There is no easy answer there too - its a function of your health system and your demographics,  smokers comorbidities.  Also a function of how many percentage idiots of your demographics break these social distancing rules. Look at Kerala - they have an obidient population and look at some of other states. 

If you came looking for a simple answer - I am sorry there is none. 1) It takes appox 10 days for the infection effect to mature. And around 20% patients in India are dying when the infection effect peaks.  That's why you will see death rate increasing after X number of days. These patients who were counted earlier in only infection rate also get added to death rate.

2) After lockdown few cases were caught too late to be saved , for whatever reasons - delays in testing, slow diagnosis etc. So these numbers went directly to death rate and infection rate.

3) Many patients were found post-mortum to be Covid positive, when it was mandated that anyone who died with Pneumonia like symptoms should be tested, these also went directly to death rate and infection rate."
54,AskIndia,[askindia] Someone please help me with my anxiety and porn addiction.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fpuopo/askindia_someone_please_help_me_with_my_anxiety/,"I've been addicted to porn and masturbation for over 5 years. I've tried to stop several times but I just couldn't. I don't feel guilty or ashamed about it. It's  just that I want to be in control of myself. I think I'm compulsively consuming it as it eases my anxiety. If I stop watching I feel like tearing my head apart. My heart starts racing and I feel extremely irritable. 

I've already visited three pyschiatrists and talked about this. Tried anxiety meds that made me feel even more miserable. I don't know how else to come out this. I feel like I need to replace it with something else that will ease my anxiety. idk please help."," Your porn addiction is a Coping mechanism for your root problem.

 Stopping that addiction won't be enough also you will in a relapse and then building your streak, so don't be hard on yourself. Educate yourself on these topics. Are you interested in learning music? Maybe pick up some instrument? It will help. There's only one way to beat any addiction, you need to spend that energy somewhere else. Check r/nofap As with all addictions you need to taper it off.

Also you need to fill the void with something else. Do a lot more of this productive activity that you enjoy as you taper off your addiction.

Like you said you don't feel guilty or regret about porn and fapping.

That is the perfect attitude to drop an addiction. Keep trying to taper off your habits and don't feel guilty or regret if you get off your tapering schedule. 

Like with anything in life, all it takes is practice. How many times do you jerk off in a day? Educating yourself on this will divert your attention away from it. Keep reading articles on how bad it is. And you will start to leave it gradually. Kuch aur timepass dhundh karne ko. Play games like Europa Universalis IV or Stellaris. Start lifting weights.Replace one with another obsession.  I am damn sure that lifting weights religiously will improve your life a lot. sadly, you can do it now. So, I guess meditate. And keep yourself busy. You should keep your self busy in others tasks you like to do, it could be some hobby of yours or anything which you enjoy doing. When i was addicted, i figured out that whenever i was free i always surfed the internet for porn which led to me doing the same as you. Keep your mind busy. This will give your heart some solace.

P S: masturbation and porn are ok but why do that when there are real relationships out there .. What's scaring you? Are you procrastinating ?
Is there something that you are supposed to be doing and not doing ? 
.
Do it. And remember how good it feels when you're anxiety free. Doesn't it feel good? Don't you want that?
.
Or do you want few seconds of dopamine rush that just doesn't feel enough and stay mind fucked the entire time? What's better OP? Few seconds of boost or a continuous good feeling, motivation, excitement? 
.
Others have covered the topics already. 
https://youtu.be/QUpyimrptw0 
Try this, might motivate you a bit. Remember the porn isn't real. It's fucking you up, this is not what we are supposed to be doing or atleast not to this extent. Start doing workout, yoga Don't do boring stuff Don't worry too much about the porn and masturbation. There have been many studies that indicate that they won't hurt you. Although you still need to understand that most of the stuff shown in porn is unrealistic and you shouldn't base any real life expectations on that.

As for your anxiety, that appears to be a medical condition and you should seek help from qualified personnels for that. Try meditating, exercising, sticking to a schedule and keeping yourself busy if nothing else helps. Read tantra and spiritual texts. Then you can transcend the sexual energy to another higher level. The point here is not to become spiritual but to see the broad picture like from a higher dimension. Find a girl. put your friend in isolation I am not a psychologist nor is anyone in these comments. Visit one and take a opinion from there. This is not the place you must discuss this. Which one affects you more? porn or masturbation?  Can you do one without the other? [removed]"

* Will probably be fired in coming months if the recession gets bad.

Hotels are already closed down and fired 75 percent of workers. The small businesses won't be able to pay the rent so they have no option but to shut shop.

The home isolation has caught up to me and I'm wondering what it's like for people in India who have been reclusive and have been living at home for years and years. Is the phenomena of hikikomori different in India? I know many in our country are unemployed. Where do such people live? Are they truly socially reclusive? How do people make ends meet in such a dire situation? How do they cope with the extreme social isolation and general disregard of a non contributor in a society? What can people do to identify such behaviors? What triggered it for you? Is there a way to curb such triggers? 

If you do relate to this phenomenon please don't shy away and open up about what you feel. Indians suffer a lot of developmental problems when growing up. Some people are high functioning despite their inherent problem which often snowballs into something big, it's only a matter of time. Bullying and peer pressure play a huge role in our society and affects our personal decisions. How do we mitigate all of this?

I'd love to engage with you guys over here for now and have a better understanding of your expectations and needs. To whoever that participates on this thread: please be civil and respectful. God knows how much people have already suffered."," The whole concept of hikikomori might be differently perceived in India than what is generally seen in Japan. India definitely have a fair share of recluse populace, but I doubt the people who stay in isolation for such long time can survive in India. Most of the parents of hikikomoris in Japan have come to accept the fact that their son/daughter is a shut in. I can't even imagine our parents being like that, especially when we as a country fail to stress the importance of mental health. Been working for a few months now but I spent around 5 years unemployed prior to it.

Lived with parents. Still do. They've been supportive.

College was the trigger for me I had zero liking for the course and at the same time didn't really have any interest at all which I could pursue instead. So I dragged myself through graduation because something was better than no qualification at all.

Initially I went through that phase where I punished myself for being a useless loser who fell behind his peers. But I never had any dreams or passions with regards to career and stuff so my NEET status in itself gradually stopped being too bothersome an issue to handle but every once in a while, when things went South, I wished I had a bearable facade of a purpose to keep myself occupied during those times. 

I've been always been pretty bad at socialising. Once I went into the NEET lifestyle and got completely acclimatised to it, it worsened the matter. I stopped keeping in touch with the few friends I had from school. I felt as if we inhabited different worlds so there wasn't much to converse about. Made a few friends online but the came and went.

I work now but it hasn't affected my feelings about work and social life. Working 9 hours a day, 6 days a week continues to he an outrageously ridiculous concept to me and I almost never desire to create new connections. I can't guess what exactly would have made the difference for me because I remember myself being like this even in my oldest memories."

1. How could China prevent virus transmitting to another state but allowed it to spread across India?
2. How is China treating Corona patients(which vaccines, which medicines)? The mortality in China is just 3% but Italy got much higher mortality rates
3. Is China hiding their numbers and millions of people actually died there?

Jai Shri Ram."," 1. They cant and didnt  
You can't 'control' life. It finds a way...      
2. Treating symptoms, drug combo's and experience from previous outbreaks. They were already in a better prepared scenario and was able to scale up infrastructure in a couple of weeks/along with early internal lockdown.  
Italy didn't take adequate precautions, has a higher older age population and was late to respond. The worst is over for italy now. US and possibly Brazil could top charts next if not us.       
3. Possible many countries are doing atm. Mortality rates in countries which took adequate precautions and had better responsive/emergency measures have low mortality rates along with greater testing. China hid the numbers, and the peak started to develop during a human mass migration event. This allowed the virus to start spreading everywhere. The Chinese government, if it did not hide the spread of the virus, would have stopped travel way before CNY migration started. The spread in India came through International travel. * Dictatorship does as dictatorship wishes. The Chinese media whose only source is the government said that it didn't, doesn't mean it didn't. 

* Italy has a very high population of senior citizens and unluckily they had to be left untreated to save the younger population.

* If not millions, at least a lakh did. 

JSR 1. Cuz the virus didn't ask for China's permission before spreading across India. It controlled it internally the same way India is trying to - by enforcing lockdowns. 

2. This is a slightly technical question. Better to ask it on r/covid19 if you want good answers.

3. Yes, it is possible. No one outside the Chinese govt will ever know the truth. 1. It spread through whole of China before it spread to India or anywhere else
2. Mortality is in reality about 10% or more in China (Italy's health care system is way better than China's)
3. Millions died in China

The commies are just good at lying. It just seems like Chernobyl al over again. In a couple of months we will get the real numbers out of China. Its stupid to postulate China allowed to spread it to India. India is a sovereign nation and had done well to not have cases imported from Wuhan. The second wave is from Gulf US and UK.

64,AskIndia,"[AskIndia] Fathers/mothers of Reddit India, what were the 38-41 weeks of pregnancy like for you? Long post ahead.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fkql7h/askindia_fathersmothers_of_reddit_india_what_were/,"Hi everyone!

I am currently in my 25th week (late 2nd trimester) and I'm trying to educate myself about what lies ahead for me. I have to zero in on the most important decision - the city of birth (job city?/my hometown?/husband's hometown?). I need to decide this ASAP as traveling after 28 weeks(April end that is) is generally not advised.

Which brings me to making this post here. I want to gather all the information/anectodes/experiences, in a countdown way, about the D-Day/D-weeks. If the circumstances allow, I would prefer a normal delivery. However, I totally understand how uncertain pregnancies can get. I just feel being informed can help us stay less anxious & not panic. Its going to be long and my thoughts might seem all over the place, so please bear with me. Here are my questions:

1) How frequent are the scheduled* OB/GYN visits in the very last month, assuming a normal pregnancy? Currently I visit once a month, for routine check up and milestone/mandated tests (flu vaccination, various blood tests, sonography, etc)

*(By scheduled I mean no complication was experienced by the woman or any urgency(water breaking, bleeding, etc) occured)

2) One lady who had the same OBGYN as me when went for her scheduled 37th week visit, was told she will have a C-Section as the child is getting overweight (weighing 3 kgs then). The OBGYN asked her to soon decide which date she would like the surgery to happen and let the doctor know. The lady said she however got labor pain the very next day and delivered via vaginal delivery. Now, I am a little skeptical here; from what I've read, **2.5-3.5 kgs is the average birth weight for newborns in India**. How can 3 kgs be overweight then? I'm already very paranoid about the state of deliveries in urban, big-name hospitals and this incident scares me more. There is no data public on the number of normal and surgical deliveries a hospital has, so that one can decide, and once you're in, you're in. After that, you have to leave everything at the doctor.

3) One lady who delivered at the same hospital (different OBGYN) as me, went at 37 weeks when she felt contractions. Her cervix was examined twice in a 5 hour span. She said she couldn't bear going through that painful examination again and asked for a C-Section herself (totally fair). My question is, are these cervix examinations by hand so necessary, when they're leaving the bearing lady in pain? Is there no other way (imaging, ultrasound, etc)? My point is those contractions could have been what is called 'false labor' and if not for the pain due to the examination, that lady could have gone home and come again full-term or when she felt contractions again?

4) My sister went for a scheduled visit in 38th week. Her cervix was examined, she started bleeding. She was told to come back if bleeding continued till evening, which it did. She had to be operated the next day, after staying in labor room for some 24-32 hours. This again makes me skeptical about cervix examinations.

5) What's the countdown going to be like? When does one know that ""yes, its now that I rush to the hospital."" Should I be scared of just a few drops of blood? Should I rush the very first time I experience period like cramps? From my few interactions with mothers, I feel 37-38 weeks is the sweet spot where many things happen. I know my post gives a lot of distrusting vibes towards doctors, that they're there to loot us, they try to 'invent' some complication in these sweet spot weeks to push for C-Sections, etc. Trust me, I would like to be proven wrong. Hence, I'm here to collect as much anectodes about false alarms, doctor sending the lady home even after mild contractions as its not time yet instead of asking to schedule a C-Section, etc as I can.

5) From what I understand, some women might never experience labor even after 40-41 weeks and hence have to be induced. Are some women induced before that too? What could lead to induction before full term?

6) Do all women having a vaginal delivery get an epidural/other pain medication, or only those who demand it when they get tired, or when they can't bear pain?

7) Did anyone research natural birth centers? There are many in the major cities, like 1) Sanctum Birth Center, Hyderabad, 2) Birth Village, Kochi, 3) Daimaas Natural Birth Center, Mumbai, 4) Apollo Cradle, Gurugram. Google reviews are mixed. Anyone undertook the services of these natural birth centers?

So everyone, contribute what you can towards my questions & in general, your pregnancy stories."," OP, post this in r/TWOXINDIA as well. https://www.babycenter.com/childbirth-class has all you need to know about child birth. Regarding centers,city,hospital, I don’t know. India C section is becoming very much the de facto option which is sad malpractice by doctors. Most cases natural birth is possible without much medication. 3 of my kids were natural born without any medication. 4th one (actually our 2nd) she took epidural. 1. Depends on the risk factors. High risk pregnancies require weekly monitoring. Otherwise bi monthly suffice.
2. 3 is average and is by no means overweight.   
3. Cervical examination is done to check how much the cervix has dilated. I was checked every hour when I went in while in labor (about 3-4 times). Ended up with a emergency c section as large baby + baby in distress.
4. Any bleeding in late term, even if it's due to cervical examination needs to be monitored. Unless the doctor did a membrane sweep, there shouldnt really be a bleeding but then again depends on sensitivity I guess.
5. I had a cervical check a day prior to my labor (I was at week 39 and very close to my due date) and I had no bleeding but went into labor naturally much later at night. I woke up with back pain after midnight and I just knew this was it. Went to the loo, water broke, told my husband it was time and then woke up my parents. Waddled to hospital 2 hours later after I timed my contractions and knew they were getting a min apart. 
6. High risk and multiples. Also Indian doctors love inducing women even when they are in labor to reduce the labor time which makes it much harder on the women (I was induced despite being in labor already and the pain shot through the roof).
7. Only large hospitals can administer pain relief for vaginal birth as most hospitals in india don't have monitoring systems in place to check for contractions and tell the woman to push. 
8. None. I was birthing at my home town. So I chose the one which had a sensible doc that would listen to me and not swat my concerns as ""google"" led. Look up water birthing, think there's one in Kerala but I'm of the ""give birth in hospital"" opinion as I don't know how equipped these centers are to handle post natal and intensive care for babies. 
All the best. Best to cross post to the twoxindia sub as well."

66,AskIndia,AskIndia: All my family is in love with Modi and become angry like typical bhakts whenever I say anything against him. How do I convince them otherwise?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f99trn/askindia_all_my_family_is_in_love_with_modi_and/,"Charity, or in this case, Politics begins at home. I have no hope of convincing or helping other people if my whole family (immediate and extended) are hardcore fans of Modi.

Whenever I've tried to convince them, they've always retorted with 

(1) Excuses, ""But he has done so many good things...""

(2) Anger, ""We can't let terrorists enter..."" 

(3) Typical Bhakt behavior, ""This is a Hindu rashtra!""

Number (3) has saddened me the most, as I think I was still holding on to hope that they were not too far gone. Now, I just don't bring up politics anymore.

But that's not sustainable in the long run seeing the everyday horrors that they are simply ignoring.

So please help me form some arguments that can convince them otherwise in my last ditch effort to retain respect for my family."," Many people have suggested to try the Super Bhakt mode.

Like putting Modiji's photo in your purse and removing your parents. 

Some quirky things like that. Since youve tried the path of rationality and failed  try either 1 of these 2.

1) go super bakth as someone already suggested. Start doing Modi japas 24×7. Go as crazy as you can.

2) establish a patriotic stand first. Change your dp to Bose or Bagath Singh etc. Vande Maataram is your caller tune and blast it every day in the house BUT start framing bakths  and Modi as anti nationals. Call them.liars and terrorist every chance you have. If ppl come to argue have solid facts to back your argument. Shouldnt be hard because they really are liars and terrorists. Again go crazy.

Don't feel guilty whatever you do, it's in service of the nation. You can't convince them honestly. 1. Excuses: Ask them to give you proof of what he has done. Tell them data shows the GDP growth and employment are at their lowest. India’s ranking has fell on most accounts. So what has he done really? 

2. Anger: Explain to them that just because Modi is there terrorists haven’t stopped entering. If they entered before they still do and if they didn’t then, then don’t now too. The Indian Army for most part works independent of the party in power. It’s a rhetoric being fed to people. 

3. Bhakt mentality: This one is tough to counter but ask them counter questions like “do you want a Hindu Pakistan?” They seem to be allergic to the word Pakistan so coupling these two freaks them out. Also you can mention how Gandhi espoused for a secular India and wanted equality for all irrespective of religion. If they say anything bad about Muslim community as a whole, start bashing them by saying that they are pathetic creature and people with same mentality are there in both religion and won't let peace prevail in this country . Ask them whether he will be happy if u go an kill someone/be a part of riot since he want hindu rastra . And don't pay them any respect , since they don't deserve it . Ignore them and irritate them with all news forwards , the so called good dead of modi. Make them see the videos of the riots and tell him whether he want u to be the one of the victims or even the oppresors. Don't participate in any religious thing and if necessary u can even point out their fake hinduism that they practice by quoting swami Vivekananda.  If they love u , they can't ignore these things and if they still don't care better avoid them and make them feel that u hate them and don't care about them Just dont give up on them. Keep calm and fight back with facts. A lot of times people fool themselves with fake news. They know its probably fake but since their echo chamber says its true they run with it. when they are repeatedly confronted with the realization that what they read on whatsapp is probably no true theyll begin to see the light.   


  
if they dont . make a mental note that in case you have kids youll never force hate on them. No point arguing don't spoil your relations. Everything ends do not worry, they have placed him on a pedestal. With time how things are panning out looking at current condition he too will fall like several others that came before him. It's sad that this douche had to happen when we were still doing good even with huge curruption. Give it time this too shall pass. Ask them why Modi is advertising Gandhi to Trump, who is a villain and not Godse ji who was the greatest desh bhakt who ever lived. Also ask them why Modiji let Trump visit the monument built by traitor Mughals and not the Sardar statue which is the greatest virat monument ever built.. Is Modi gone sickular and become an apologist of Gandhi Nehru legacy.. If they are old people, try explaining them what Hinduism actually is. It's definitely not killing people. XD Show them the video of the real purohit of Ayodhya saying that Babri demolition was wrong. Show them videos about Swami Vivekananda and Gandhiji responding to communal flares.

72,AskIndia,[AskIndia] How many months left till India gets slapped with hefty sanctions?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ez5344/askindia_how_many_months_left_till_india_gets/,"Less than 10 crores blind bhakts out of 140 crores Indians, have done immense damage to image of India in all international stages. India has been bullying all forms of protesters. When Malaysia criticized an Indian policy, Indian government stopped importing palm oil from Malaysia. But Karma always bites back with interest. 

Many USA company heads are also criticizing India, resulting in backlash from government of India. It may be a just matter of time, USA gets royally pissed off with India and starts imposing sanction in the lines of Iran, Iraq, Syria.

Your thoughts please."," If we get sanctioned then the poor will suffer more, so I hope never Not happening. Some legislators and committees here and there may criticize, but outright sanctions are out of the question. US and EU governments are neither that moral nor that concerned as to jeopardize all their business investments and military purchases from India. I doubt that will happen because US sees India as a counter to China How delusional can you be? The world isn't a black and white place where justice is always served and righteous people always win. Everyone has their vested interests.

And you seriously think that there are only 10 crore bhakts?

Sometimes it makes me think that the left wing is filled with idealistic babies with zero knowledge of ground realities. I sometimes wonder, is the IQ level of reddit crowd plummeting day by day or what? 

What are you, a 14 year old asking such retarded questions when you yourself can very vividly answer the question yourself. 

* India is a major trading partner to many important countries including the USA, EU and Russia. 
* India has far more good relations with other governments of Latin America, Africa than it has enemies. 
* On what moral grounds will the countries sanction us? CAA? On what grounds? When the most powerful country in the world actively blocks citizens from random muslim countries and EU nations have their own problems with immigration, integration. 
* Comparing with the countries like Iran, Iraq, Syria. You would be dead if you had pulled even the 1% of protest level against the government. I mean do you even know what you write? Imao china has literal concentration camps for Muslims and the world did shit.  People need to stop seeing west as some bastion of justice they only sanction someone when they have something to gain. Sanctions are a foreign concept. we don't care. 

Bhakts will be happy that now hindus can manufacture whatever they want right here in india.

They will see this as a plus. This has been discussed on this sub before.

The govt's response to protests against the CAA is an internal matter, and much like the US President's subtle, indirect support of neo-Nazis and white supremacy in America, the outside world doesn't have the authority to interfere. What happens is that with the outcomes of studies like the Democracy Index, Freedom of Press, Ease of Doing Business etc, the conception of India changes. And that impression is quite important when it comes to European countries investing in India, or even Japanese/Korean companies investing in India. 

There is no doubt about the fact that the right wing ideology pursued by the govt is hurting or economy, but it won't invite sanctions a la North Korea or Iran. The only thing that could do so now is if India invaded PoK, or something similarly drastic, which the BJP govt won't do before the Delhi elections. BJP could be the worst govt in recent memory, but criticizing our sanctions on Malaysia is plain stupid. Our foreign service did the right thing.

In foreign affairs a head of a country usually does not comment on the internal affairs of another country be it right or wrong. Even the presidents of fucking America and China do not explicitly comment on our internal affairs the way Mahatir did.

The language used is very important, usually presidents use statements like ' we hope for a de-escalation etc. ' and they do not mention the ruling govt of another country in their statement.

If Mahatir had genuine concerns he would have no issues criticizing China for their uighur treatment.

If we didnt sanction Malaysia for that statement we would be treated as pushovers on the world stage. There is no right or wrong in foreign affairs, India being a big regional power has to act like one. > USA gets royally pissed off with India and starts imposing sanction in the lines of Iran, Iraq, Syria.

US can no longer apply sanctions to India the way they did back in 1998. The US depends a lot on India for cheap labor and an upcoming Internet-related customer base.

Even if Modi turns into a dictator, they will appease him with free shit and get a hand into the market.

Also, Modi is Trump's bitch. India is resistant to sanctions to a certain extent. It would also be beneficial for us in the long run. Earlier sanctions against India during the nuclear program helped in building local industries and increasing local technology. Economic sanctions will come but may not be for the reasons you have mentioned. Right wing and nationalism is rising across the world. And this would result in more and more closing of borders in the name of protecting national interests. This is what is going to affect global trade in the near future. Just my two cents. Won't happen unless China becomes less of a threat. Right now the US needs us Kiska sanctions ? UNSC or by US or by EU ?
Sanctions are placed only when a country possesses an ""immediate"" threat or is indulging in HR violations.
And what will be restricted? Travel ban, arms embargo, economic and trade.
Sanctions work when other nations co-operate, EU sanctions crippled Russia and UN sanctions obliterated Iran's economy Many small time journalists/reporters to get ideas, roam around on social media, so are you one? To all the nay sayers.. Don't be too Confident about our geopolitical importance.. Sanctions don't have to be big blanket bans.. Today environmental clearances are no longer required for oil exploration, the way reliance works they're gonna rape whatever site they will work on.. Leading to a environmental catastrophe which could lead to Sanctions.. It could be anything and our current govt is filled with incompetents.

73,AskIndia,What steps women can take for their safety. [AskIndia],https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e3ond3/what_steps_women_can_take_for_their_safety/,"Time and again, we have so many incidents of crime against women India. We can't have policemen or guardians accompanying women all the time.  What all steps women can take in case of emergency. Few things that comes to my mind 


1. Carry pepper spray. Also, please do an emergency drill for using it. 

2. Learn self-defense martial arts. 

3. Carry taser?

4. Always notify someone while traveling alone in cab/auto. Share registration number of vehicle loudly on call.  So that driver knows someone is aware of your whereabouts. 

5. In case you are stranded somewhere if traveling in a car, do lock all the windows and call the police.  In case of 2 wheeler, just ditch it or ride with punctured tire to nearest petrol pump, toll, shop. 

6. Never travel alone in an inebriate state. 

Please add your suggestions.

Edit : Stranded not strangled"," This illusion of control is just that, an illusion. Even a guy wouldn’t be able to defend himself against a group intent on overpowering him. I don't know about safety but if you need to pass critical information in case of emergencies you can use Automate app. It's an automation app you can do things with minimal interaction. You can also add shortcuts to your home screen, so with one tap you can automate hell lot of things. I use it daily and it's a huge time saver for me. So during emergencies where every second is crucial you can use that time to send as much as information to your friends and family members. There are countless ideas on how you can use this app. You play with this app for sometime and you will get it.

It's a powerful app so use it with caution. Check the child lock, before getting into cab Also protest, demand action. Hold the authorities accountable. 

Educate men. Speak out against lewd behavior, in person and whenever it's portrayed in media. 

Avoid traveling alone in the night, especially in insecure areas. Request a colleague to accompany you if it's unavoidable. 

Learn self defense or carry weapons.

But most important of all, do not give up your liberty. Most sexual violence is also intended to subjugate women and lower than standing in society. Fight for equality and your rightful place in society. It's sad to see the focus on totally different things in  the moment of tragedy. No way a girl can overcome more than two guys unless she is a champion boxer or mixed martial artist. Instead of asking for police and judicial reforms and 911 like helpline number our focus is on how to make women learn self defense. As far as pepper spray is concerned, here are some tips

* Make sure there is no wind blowing towards you
* Use it on the face of the suspect and flee immediately.
* practice on a dummy in your balcony
* Keep it in a keychain or somewhere easily accessible 
* If a security person asks what it is, you can say it is pocket deodorant, etc. &#x200B;

1. If you are a concerned citizen and know of dark/scary/hostile regions in your neighhborhood, don’t wait for a rape to happen to make that space safe. It is immensely rewarding to fix lights and increase patrol before something bad happens (personal experience).
2. If you know of any assaulters/rapists in your friend group, ensure that everyone you know knows about them and they know they will always be watched. Don’t bother with public opinion and ‘women ruin lives with lies’ BS, keeping friends safe is key.
3. If you find out that your friends have been harassed or assaulted, ensure that anyone who victim-blames them, or tries to discuss things they ‘could’ have done to prevent shit is shown the door. Women spend hours anxious about their safety anyway, next steps are more important than ‘what ifs’. Keep names of legal advisors and therapists handy.
4. If your  friend/ relative was assaulted as a child by some who is still a favoured relative/ family friend, it is never to late for them to speak their truth. Support your person thought their journey, ensure that such predators don’t ever prey on young people ever again. Keep an eye on them, publicly.
5. If you are at a wedding which serves alcohol, and notice rowdy behaviour, call it out. Yes, it’s someone else’s joyful occasion, but drunken assaulters use alcohol, crowds and people’s hesitation to strike. Alert a few sober people and create a subtle surveillance system around people who ""aren't in control"".
6. People who survive assault/rape may have PTSD. Ensure that your responses to news on sexual harassment, rape and abuse doesn’t make them feel like shit. It will make you part of their support system.
7. Be the kind of human whose vulnerable friends would be comfortable and trusting enough to stay over with. It saves lives.

This is what I have to do, and have had to do. Carry a small concealable surgical blade. make perpendicular slits. Carry a small knife and learn how to use it, learn how to use it and run away as quickly as you can.

https://youtu.be/BxoScSOkCCs People have many good suggestions did not see this so adding one here ... of course if under threat you need to reach out support : family friends or 100. Assuming you have notified and are waiting for help to arrive and the bad folks have still not gotten to a stage where you are overpowered, start Facebook live or live-streaming. At least what happened or parts of it will be available to people to get some clues and you can also use it to tell the bad guys that your picture is now on internet.

While trying to capture either video or photos, make sure they are direct to internet (will need to set up your settings before hand) and you take a picture of the area as well as people, to the extent you can. Whenever my wife is alone in cab late nights she always calls me and keeps talking to me loudly throughout the ride. She gives driver hints like I am a man and I will meet her at drop point. Also, she shares live location on whatsapp and I keep looking at it from time to time. If you are ever thrown into the trunk of a car, kick out the back tail lights and stick your arm out the hole and start waving like crazy. The driver won't see you, but everybody else will. This has saved lives. I carry a Swiss army knife which my brother taught me to use (I still don't feel confident but hey its there). 
On my phone (through Google maps) have set up location sharing with 2  people. 
When taking an uber, have set up sharing of location. 
I make it a point to inform my family the minute I start from and towards my home.
I always make it a point to call someone (or even fake call) the minute I am in an auto or car and day how much time roughly it will take me and that they can track me.
When on my bike, I am with other bikers so not alone. And we travel long distance but not after sundown. I understand the post's positive intention, but it is heart-breaking  that one has to do so much to just to stay safe and to carry on with their life, pursue their dreams and to live a normal existence in a 'society'. Learn how you could use a ball pen, always keep a metal ball pen, target his eyes. In times of puncture, do not ever worry about it damaging your bike, it will cause very minute damage, but that is totally worth than putting your life in danger. You can go miles with your both tires punctured (Not sure if you can go faster). 
I myself have driven my bike on a road trip after getting front tire punctured and the nearest village was 2-3 km away. NOTHING!!!

All those precautions you have listed have time and again be used by different women throughout this country. It is already a stifling atmosphere for women here and I will not blame them for migrating to other countries if they get the chance.

As a man I have always loved my independence and the ability to just backpack and go somewhere on my own. I have seldom thought what it is from the point of view of a woman and these recent sexual assault incidents just show a side of India which I have not personally experienced. 

I am of the belief that death sentence and castration should be given to rapists especially for gang rape type incidents. I have heard many times that death sentences don’t act as a deterrent especially from law enforcement and human rights morons in this country but they are wrong.

Death really does act as a deterrent especially with regard to the typical Indian male. To be frank, the average Indian man is timid. He doesn’t have the courage to stand up for himself and doesn’t have the courage to fight for his rights. When such an individual is interacting with the opposite sex, he feels somewhat of an unknown power because in his mind women are of the weaker sex and come what may he will have power over her. When such men group together, it can lead to disastrous consequences. That is why gang rape is mostly a phenomenon of South Asian countries and few war torn African countries.

These same Indian men go to foreign countries such as the Middle East and Europe but they avoid doing the same there. Why? Because they have fear of the law. 

Our judicial system is overseen by old men and women who can be called dinosaurs in this day and age. It’s all nice for the liberal elite to copy the practices of foreign countries debating whether death penalty is ethical or not while forgetting the demographic differences between the people of our country and foreigners especially with regarding to race , iq and upbringing. Let’s face it.. most Indians are uncivilized and therefore for uncivilized people stringent laws are applicable. Barring instances of being innocently charged, we could do with some culling of the population, especially some men. Emigrate. Love how the conversation after a catastrophic incident is always about ""how not to get raped"" ""how to defend yourself against rapists"" instead ya know.... the initiators of the horrific acts. Best they can do is fuck off from this awful country and settle to some other where they aint seen as  consumable . Asking women to take safety precautions is fine but the real way to stop rapes is to well ,stop men from raping.

&#x200B;

Unpopular opinion but we need to make an example out of the perpetrators of these vicious crimes. You can say this is my outrage but these perpetrators do not deserve human rights since they have proved by their acts that they do not deserve to be called human. I am not suggesting a mob lynching here but the law must be extremely strict for rape in this country. People need to know that if they commit rape, they will be found out and they will be reprimanded severely . Further all the netas who have rape cases against them need to be brought to book. We need to set the example that no matter how high and mighty you are, rape in India is a serious offence.

And of course mental health. Being exposed to pornography and item songs in a society where  conversations about sex are taboo is another reason why there are so many rapes in India. We need a sex education and mental health programmme that has better outreach.

The outraged me says- Chauk pe khada kar saalo ko, baaki sab hum dekh lenge. Honest question. Are tasers legal in India? Migrate from India One most important thing to always remember is, as the minister said, call the police the moment you feel unsafe. Don't worry about false alarms. Better a thousand false alarms than a tragedy. Similarly, if you are the woman's relative, call the police immediately if her phone is switched off. 

Don't go by the bad reputation of the police. The corrupt judgemental assholes in the police are a lot better than the soulless demons on the streets. Practice running. Sprint, as well as long runs. They can't do much if they can't catch you. \>> Never travel alone in an inebriate state. 

There are a lot more common-sense tips like this one could mention. The flip-side of pointing out the obvious is to attract trolls! I gave my wife a pocket alarm sorta thing. No larger than your car key, this thing makes very loud/annoying noise when active, and it is pretty difficult to find the off switch (by design) for someone who is not familiar with it. Hope she never have to use it. I think self defence should be made mandatory in all schools & colleges. Please consider getting trained professionally if you can afford. Or practice at home if it's not affordable. Our body tends to freeze if we are not trained. We need to build a bit of muscle memory and mental alertness. We rarely have the time to think in such situations. 

I am sorry you have to go through this. I really am. Well I didn’t mention upper cut because it kind of takes time to learn. It’s essentially doing a really quick squat . But yeah if you can learn the upper cut in the right way, you can certainly KO someone. A few months ago while sparring my partner mistakenly landed an upper cut to my family jewels. I had a cup but holy shit it still hurt. So yeah I’d say upper cut to the chin or groin will also be great. I am in Manila, Philippines at the moment and the women are free to roam everywhere anytime of the day or night wearing what they like. India is definitely a few light years behind in this context. Adding one. Please check your phone for SOS features. Most of the current ones do have one, where, in case of emergency, you press the power button certain number of times to immediately alert your preset contacts of your whereabouts and that you need help. In Xiaomi phones, the setting is there under Password and Security. Also, avoid the outskirts of your towns and cities if possible, as those areas are primarily occupied by people who don't have a future and aren't afraid of any consequences to their action. matlab bencho apni protection ke liye bhi unko hi mehnat karni padegi. ye sikho, ye rakho kya zindagi hai ye I think you meant stranded instead of strangled.

Should probably add getting a concealed carry permit & learning how to use said weapon. I'm not advocating vigilante justice or random shootings by scared civilians but I'd much rather hear about 5 instances of rapists getting their faces shot off in one day than 5 horrific & abominable instances of rape.

Seriously, I've been in such a shitty mood after reading about the poor girl in Hyd & the police finding another body in similar circumstances literally a couple of hours later. Just absolutely sickened. For once, due process should take a back seat & scum should be treated as such. Leave the country if they can. Some self defense can help in a 1 on 1 situation but it’s better to avoid a potential situation altogether. Even a single vulnerable male cannot prevent a robbery or assault.
The only force equalizer is a gun which can take a few of the attackers out of the reckoning but that is a different discussion.
Until then, stay in populated areas and have someone pick you up or call for help. Not many people know this but on your Ola app, there's an option which can automatically send all your rider information and your cab's real time location to your friends/family when you've booked one. Upto 5 people can be selected I think and they'll get an sms as soon as you book a ride which also has things like the cab's number, driver's name and number, etc

EDIT: I think uber has the same feature but you have to do it manually after every booking. Someone please correct me if there's an automatic option 1) Realise wanting safe streets is not a women's safety issue, it's a public safety issue.

2) Realize our society and injustice system is misogynistic and patriarchal and will not help us. 

3) Become active in an org. that works to keep our streets safe like blank noise  

4) Get fit. Lift weights.  

5) Learn one martial art.

6)  Carry pepper spray/ stun gun/ taser, rape whistle. Learn to use them  

7) Get angry, not scared Educate men around you, as many as you can. The onus shouldn't be on women to go out and learn martial arts - it should be on society to not have rapists at large. I think you have pretty much covered. We need to make all the six points you have mentioned as a practice. It's terrible how we just skip the part of tackling evil in men when we are talking about this. Women shouldn't be forced to take extra steps for safety. Men need to be better than unempathetic animals. It's a sad thing to see to that we just accept evil in men as a given. It's not the women's fault, it's the men's. 

Here is the only rule that matters:

Be better at bringing up men. Be better yourself. When you hear friends casually catcalling someone, speak up. Tell them that's what potential rapists do. Sure, you might be firm in your conviction that you could never do something like that. BUt by not saying anything, you are complicit. You are the reason why toxic masculinity continues to exist. It isn't because of the evil men, it's because of men who aren't evil not saying anything. BE BETTER. I thought tasers weren't legal. I might have missed something. Can you buy taser in India 5. Always a nightmare,thank God. Honestly I don't like it but guns are the only solution.  Quick and easy. Carry a lighter and deodorant. Trust your guts if you feel unsafe. Leave the place with a good friend or family member if available. 

If nobody is there then simply sent your current location to family members and do live call video with anybody and speak out loud and tell them where you are in it. Also go to public place as fast as possible if you think you are in danger. where exactly do you get off telling me how to behave. Delete this post now if you have a single brain cell. Smash patriarchy. Trying to raise better sons would be a really good place to start. But of course, we're now going to teach women how to become superhuman. See a few videos on Pressure points for self defence Leave the country Put curfew on men after day light! 

Im tired of seeing posts on preventive measures women should take after every heinous incident like this. EVERY FUCKING TIME  we find a shortcoming in how the woman in question could have protected herself. But the onus is on men to learn how to not reduce women to mere objects and respect their autonomy. Just taking precautions does not help! Rapes happen even at home! The responsibility is on parents, schools and higher education institutions to inculcate manners! Yes manners, to learn how NOT to behave. We have been very good as a society to teach girls how to be a good wife, daughter, student or career woman etc. But clearly a large population of men has an IOTA of brains on how to treat others (especially woman) with dignity!!! I hope it doesn't get lost, but there is an app called #life360 . It sends a very accurate location, and has sos, and will update your family
Haven't tried the second idea but if you end up in a really dire situation, call the police. they may or may not pick up, i hope it never comes to it, but just try. Self defence is really a chance thing. You can't ninja through 5-6 men who are really tough. I hope it never comes to that? Individual solution is not an answer to problems which impacts mass, for example people are installing water and air purifier for individual needs but it doesn't solve the problem at aggregate level and you will always have carry filtered water bottle, purchase package bottle at a price in which you get 20X litres and wear masks all the time. It goes same in women’s safety. Answer is mass protest by women and more women in public safety force. India has most strignent law regarding women safety, still we hear rape incidents every week, why because womens are not raising voice which can shake the country to its core. India has 48.20% female popluation still lacks all majority women party. No men majority political party will hear your needs, like present government thinks sanitary pads are luxury and they taxed them. Enough of rant, always carry pepper spray, emergency alert app, learn jiu jitsu and strength training. Lastly you should able run fast if group tries to attack you. Peace. Don't be a woman. Lift weights and learn to fight. The Quran has a lot of tips for women’s safety.
1. Wear a veil
2. Have a male relative as an escort while going out or travelling.
3. Do not interact with men who are not family.
4. Convert to Islam."

Gonna get straight to the point i passed class 10 took science i kinda liked it so i thought it was okay. Fast forward got admission in a coaching institute y'all know how things are here . I was like good at the beginning but idk if i should say this but my dad who is an asshole according to me and i classify him in Type A personality (just Goole it) was always fking poking me "" why did u always get 200-240 marks out of 360 u can't do anything with it blah blah blah "" i snapped idk i just fking lost myself it was just a self destruct mode. Whatever i did they didn't give a fuck i had literally give them a list of every fucking rupee i spent they just compared me with others and wht fking good things they did just preaching shit whole day. I know i should have ignored them i didn't ok.

I just stopped studying by the end of 11 i didn't gave a fuck about my future and stuff . Things were like downhill from here i just wasted and whatever fuck i did i didn't care yea well they encouraged tried to get me back on track but nah i didn't. I kinda fked in boards i know i will get 95+ in english and pe but idk bout pcm.

I had made up my mind about suicide and shit. I actually even did  a thorough research on how to kill urself easily i actually know every convenient method. But something just happened today and i had a kind of realisation that maybe i shouldn't do   it . But now i am middle of nowhere idk wht to do. Just an fyi though i was staying away from home i don't wanna tell where. 

Thanks for reading my rant.

It's okay if u don't give a fuck cuz i know i am the asshole here."," I scored 69 in Math during my boards, Proudest achievement till date. Ah, the common after school crises. Chill out. This feeling lost situation is more common than you think, it is the outcome that differs. I've been there myself. Firstly, there's no escaping from the reality that unless you get a graduation or equal level of education, life is going to be hell. Yes, there are dropouts who have been successful but it isn't common. So get a hold of yourself and find a course that you enjoy, enroll into it and finish it. Let that be your focus for the next few years. You'll make friends in that time and life wouldn't be all miserable. You're young, which means you have the opportunity to do whatever you want and be successful. Don't squander it. And kudos for rejecting suicide, it's not a solution for anything. I want to start with a question.

Are you interested in engineering or any related job you can get after your boards?

Because, if yes. Then why not give it another shot?

I don't know your father.
I don't care about him.

But why throw your life away for someone else.

I'm no one to give advice.

But here's the thing - engineering, medicine and courses like these don't give a damn about your percentages as long as you are eligible.

But even if it goes bad - you can always give the boards again.

Same with entrances.

Heck, I am a dropper myself and I fricking loved my drop year. Got my seat at the end of it too.

So, once again I ask - do you want to give it another shot?

Because if you do.
Don't do it for the asshole.

Do it for yourself. Brother.

I know sometimes things doesn't really make sense all the time.

If you need advice, 

Listen to Eminem and get going.

Do research about singers, writers who can help in that situation, follow them and get out of that situation like a legend.

You never know whom you can help with that knowledge.

Just make a web of every single person linked to you and you will know.

These situations , comes and goes, and when we look back at life, we can just laugh about it and smile and be proud of all the good decision we took. ok bhai nothing special in your case...ye sub normal hai F In five years from now, you'll find all of it immaterial. In the meanwhile, life will carry on happening to you. Don't fret - we all have treaded this path."

Just like most other non CSE branches In general the scope for science and niche engineering jobs is very little in India.

Re Fire Engineering, the lack of scope is directly linked to the lack of urban planning in India. Urban planning is a very rich umbrella if disciplines and done right creates a lot of jobs. So it’s a great pity that this is not taken more seriously in India."

Real persona is 💰 💰💰💰💰 Akshay is asking Modi to replace him in the next movie involving 'Khiladi' in the title. Likh lo: Yeh chodu baadme ticket bhi maangega. *Sunny Deol roars in the background*

I had immense respect for Akshay Kumar once upon a time. Lately, everything he says has a desh Ka/ki prefix to it. Desh ki mitti, desh ki movie, desh ki Tatti, desh Ka lasun. When exactly did he become a sellout? _Isko koi Karan Thapar ke saath bithao yaar._

_Ravish Kumar bhi chalega_. Everything modi does is political in nature, even meeting his own mother. I don't think this is any different. Chilla chilla ke sabko amero ki scheme batade Someone must have told Modi he needs to show his softer side. Become more likeable. Nice try! Canada Kumar at it again! https://youtu.be/ctrgPD9s_yY?t=13 I don't think we elected a PM. We elected a superstar who tries to fit into the hero persona. Modi *kaka*: Time to pay for the National Award bro. So basically full 1 hr of ""aap thakte kyu nahi""

""Aap mein itni energy kaha se aati hai"" Is this about dual citizenship? race for the best actor award ***Bhaturewalas interviewing chaiwalas. tell me something moar interesting.*** ""Who has questions to my answers part-II"" brought to you by ANI but this time we hired a new anchor! :P Great actor from India with Canadian akshay kumar I actually enjoyed their Talk, and I really ask everyone to see this regardless of their political affiliation as it was really different than what I expected"

Subash Chandra founder of Essel group which includes Zee News, is a MP from Haryana with support from BJP in Rajya sabha. I respect people like Kher more than Amitabh Bachchan, at least we know where their loyalty lies.

Amitabh has been a Cong MP in 80s.

Then was close to Amar Singh and SP in later 90s and early 200s. Wife is still SP MP.

Became close to Modi when he started to rise.

Now hearing he's going back to cong as we speak.

 Ambani bhool gaye Sudhir Chaudhary - Zee TV. Prakash Raj - Congress  Prannoy Roy, Barkha Dutt, Rajdeep Sardesai and Sagarika Ghose - all Congress  i have been curious about this. most americans openly identify with one of the two (mostly) political parties... i wonder if it means that they are officially a member of that party or they just prefer them over others... it would have been nice if this was the case here as well. would have been easier to decide who to avoid and who not to looking at how things are here in this country.  Many people on here seem to misunderstand the word ""bias"". Opposing a current govt is *not* bias. Refusing to sing praises of the present govt is *not* bias. Bringing to attention where a govt has fallen short is *not* bias.

In fact, it's the job of the media to keep the ruling party in check. To remind the public that all is not well. To maintain transparency. To expose the liars.

Things that *do* constitute bias: false equivalency, what-aboutery, lying to the audience (whether outright or by omission).

Also, people are allowed to have opinions. Vishal Dadlani is not someone who needs to be neutral; he's not a public servant or a newsman. The question of bias is not relevant here at all. Randeep Hooda, Virender Sehwag - BJP Me What is this for? End purpose? Mohandas Pai, former CFO of Infosys is a rabid BJP supporter, just like most bigots in India. A-grade hypocrite too.

95,Non-Political,[Non-political] A/c train queue system implemented by people on their own,https://imgur.com/x2S75mL,," Isnt this a given thing at delhi metro stations now? Bas kar pagle,rulayega kya ? [removed] All those people who are amused by it this is what happens when you give them some infrastructure.  

With Air conditioned trains the doors are closed and open only when the train actually stops.  So you have to wait anyway. 

With other locals I have seen even auntys  board the train before it actually stops so that they can grab a seat.  No way they will wait for the train to stop because some other aunty would have grabbed the seat by then. 

Now if you really want to ensure people queue up start installing platform screening doors.  But that's expensive and I don't have any expectations from Indian railways.   Fake fake fake! OP paid the people to stand in a line! Only if this was followed for every other train too, every morning is a fight to get into a Churchgate bound train Wtf is happening? In which alternate universe is this borivali station located? Propaganda. Next thing you know they will tell that first people will be allowed to get off the train and then people will board the train. Nonsense. Wonder how this happened? Was there constant messaging to nudge people to do this? How did you manage to travel to a parallel universe? History time. When I was growing up in Mumbai in  late '80s every bus stop south of Sion used to have an orderly line to board the bus. It was very similar to this [video](https://youtu.be/ats8Y1yzgPI?t=182). Somehow the suburbs were always unruly. 

Cars waiting at red light was also very common and so was crossing street only when walk signal was on.

But there was always mad rush to board the trains. This is very refreshing.

 Queue!? ab ye kaunsi nayi western concept laye ho?

Hamare sanskriti mai koi queue nahi hota.Kabhi sunna hai pushpak viman mai chadte waqt log queue mai kadhe the?  If I were first in line, I'd just be terrified that the entire line will push forward at anytime even before the train arrives.  I recently made a trip to europe and I was amused to see how the locals were civil to other people. If there's something that Indians need to badly improve - its being civil to others. That huge fan though. People of Mumbai always surprise. The roads are crowded but flow is always smooth Its because its an A/C TRAIN. CIVILISED PEOPLE USE IT. JUST SAYIN  Yay, Mumbai! But there should be markers so that people can queue up on either side of the door and let people alight properly first. After looking this picture I am crying from inside.  Wait there are AC trains on the local lines? I catch a train from andheri in the evening everyday and this is a common sight only in the women's compartment though.. great to watch.

Also, andheri station is jam-packed in the morning and people had to literally fight for climbing up. The last two months have seen a major change and Now everyone stands in a proper queue Wow, this is the India I want to see.  Haath pe chapti maar re. Oh wait...... that's central line. Don't know when central line will become decent. Good to see some positive story since  ages This can only happen in non-rush hours in Mumbai Locals. 

If people start queuing at rush hour the line will stretch for 2 kms outside the station.  Aaja Bhai Tu Bhi Line Mein This is a very interesting experiment in Indian behaviour.

1. If you somehow project the idea of discipline onto people, 95% of them will follow. 50% of these will be rowdy and lawless while taking a local train but will suddenly stand in line because there's a line expected or being formed in front of them in the metro [I've seen this happen IRL].

 And while the line collapses pretty soon, it is still an attempt at order which partially succeeds in two ways - people can alight without battling through a wave of incoming bodies, and folks who are right in the front of these lines get assured seating/standing of their choice.

2. You will see people blatantly flouting rules, throwing their garbage on the floor etc. on normal train platforms. But our metro stations? They're some of the cleanest places in India. Just look at the difference in India's metros - be it Kolkata, Delhi, Mumbai... The cities is filthy, the metro system is clean as a whistle.

3. The security system works. Not for its intended role, but it keeps loose food and drink outside the metro system.

I believe civic planners and govt officials can learn some lessons here. *Rechecks*
Am I on the right sub reddit ? 
*Rechecks* There is hope for the country. Demonitization actually had a few benefits!!! Next thing you know people will stop littering.  Then when the streets are clean the cops will stop beating and extorting street vendors and the poor.  Then that will have a snowball effect, and the road workers will start repairing roads with enthusiasm.  Traffic will move smoother and people will be in a better mood, they'll stop going out at night to rape innocent women and children.

Finally, the politicians will see all this and ask for 2% less bribe. This works only until the train arrives. Then it's a free for all. Nice quality! Which camera? Which station? And then there's that one mandatory asshole who decides to jump the queue and plunges everyone into the usual state of chaos.

Cleverest people , if all mumbai and suburban trains do this , half the problems will be solved . nice post Kaun hai yeh log, kahan se aatey hain ye log? This is common in mumbai at bus stops. In fact no where in India do people 'follow traffic rules' as much as mumbai in my experience.  What alternate universe is this? Sandwich massage for free I can confirm that this happens in the gold class of dubai metro whereas as in normal compartments people just rush in and out like in india They do this in nyc too........  Security staff in Bengaluru metro makes people queue up like this. All of that vanishes once the train arrives lmao Yeh kabse hone laga yaha??? 😯😯  Nice editzz Queing for reserved ticket isn't a big deal. But for local it is. It is impossible . looks like they renovated borivali When people start building a whole railway station on their own without any corporation help, I'm not amused when they start standing in queues.

As far as I know they are hosting an entire event based on the hashtag, it wouldn't be long till people start screaming the hashtag around couples who just want to spend some time together. 

This just feels weird.

Edit : #PyaarEkDhokhaHai translates to #LoveIsBetrayal
Mostly targeted towards singles who are frustrated about not having a date for Valentine's."," Yep, yet another ""let's get viral"" tactic, looks like.  It was ok at first but now it feels forced. Tanmay Butt if you're reading this, tu sannyas le bhai.  World is coming closer to Black Mirror day by day!
Episode: Hated in the Nation I agree.

I don't mind the hashtag, but the event and all is stretching it. It just sounds kinda stupid and weak to me. Bhaiyya toh kya samjhe ki youtube pe intellectuals milenge?  Unsubscribed from AIB's channel a long time ago, quiet happy. [deleted] I'll happily debate anyone who says PyarEkDhokhaHai

Because I've experienced the opposite What does PyaarEkDhokhaHai  even mean?? Mediocrity sells and AIB are doing a good job at it . Guess now they are the Salman Khan of YouTube. Never followed them or such. They are for urban teenagers who don't have a sense of humour and don't know words beyond bhencho.

 Exactly! It’s just silly IMO  I was thinking this while going through their Instagram story as well. Kinda seems like an exercise in futility.  Please tell me it is just a joke and not an actual event that people are attending.  If someone provides the translation I can also decide to outrage.  To Be Honest, The whole bashing of couples and the Valentine's Day/Week was fine until a certain point. Making light-hearted memes, cracking poor jokes was fine. But this whole hashtag and the upcoming events planned by AIB and others is meaningless and capitalises on the frustration of singles who can't get into a relationship despite desperately wanting to! I'll probably get a lot of downvotes for this but I think it's a very clever marketing strategy. At the and end of the day AIB is a brand and they seem to have figured out a viral branding technique cashing in on the large pool of single people who are active on social media.    
   
I'd also like to ask everyone calling them the personification of mediocrity to give me some examples of good Indian brands in the content space.  Can anyone fill me in on what it's about?


Also ,fuck AIB, mediocrity personified. They're finally living up to their name, in a literal way. they have sponsors. Don't take this shit seriously Can we stop having self derogatory memes until a point people seriously start believing it and trouble/judge others if they talk about having a better experience?   

I mean, I have never dated hell I am shy as fuck if I need to approach a girl but I know it will work if I want it to work and try to make myself a decent human being. I don't even get it. Is it supposed to be ironical? Sarcastic? Commentary on regressive society? AIB is still a thing? Finally somebody said it!! Hosting an entire event on that is just too ridiculous. Atleast screaming the hashtag around couples seems like a fun idea to me."

India: How a rich nation became poor and will be rich again

Essays | March 19, 2007 - 12:38

(Developing Cultures : Case Studies, co-edited by Peter Berger and Laurence Harrison, Routledge, 2005.)

Does 'culture' in some way help to explain the fact that the same Indian economy that was stagnating for the first fifty years of the 20th century began to grow at a respectable clip after 1980 and was amongst the fastest growing in the world by the end of the century?

Consider the following hundred year trend: between 1900 and 1950, the Indian economy grew on the average 0.8 percent a year; but the population also grew at about the same rate; thus, net growth in income per capita was nil and we rightly called our colonial economy stagnant. After Independence, economic growth picked up to 3.5 percent between 1950 and 1980, but so did population growth (to 2.2 percent); hence the net affect on income was 1.3 percent per capita, and this is what we mournfully referred to as “the Hindu rate of growth.” Things began to change with modest liberalization in the eighties when annual economic growth rose to 5.6 percent. This happy trend continued in the reform decade of the nineties when growth averaged 6.2 percent a year, while population slowed to 1.8 percent; thus, per capita income rose by a decent 4.4 percent a year.

As a benchmark, recall that the West's industrial revolution took place at a 3 percent GDP growth and 1.1 percent per capita income growth after 1820. To appreciate the magnitude of the Indian change after 1980, let me illustrate: If India's per capita GDP had continued growing at the pre-1980 level, then its income would have reached present American capita income levels only by 2250; but if it continues to grow at the post-1980 rate then it will reach those levels by 2066: a gain of 184 years!

How does one begin to explain India's economic performance over the past hundred years? The Indian nationalist blames the first fifty years' stagnation on British colonialism. But a trade economist will counter this by showing that the world economy was also stagnant in the first half of the 20th century (especially after World War I) when world per capita GDP grew annually at just under one percent.2 The main culprits, he would say, were conflict and autarky. Disgraceful protectionism by most governments between the Wars slowed both the world and the Indian economy.

Although the Indian economy picked up after 1950, the neoclassical economist would argue that it performed below the world economy, which experienced a “golden age” driven by trade expansion until 1971. Like the rest of the Third World India did not benefit from global trade expansion because it had closed its economy and pursued 'import substitution'. Moreover, Nehru's socialism had shackled the economy with fierce controls on the private sector, pejoratively called 'Licence Raj'; hence its annual GDP growth was 1.5 percentage points below even the Third World average between 1950 and 1980.3

This changed dramatically with modest liberal reforms in the 1980s and more sweeping ones in the 1990s as the Indian economy integrated with the world. In those twenty years it not only outperformed the world economy significantly but it was amongst the fastest in the world.4 Thus, gradual technological diffusion, rising capital accumulation and productivity, and gradual education expansion help economists to explain a good deal of the story. There is also the value of time and accumulated learning through time. “Collective learning” is Hayek's term, and he applied it to the cumulative experience that generations build up which is embodied in the language, the technology, and the way of doing things.5

But economic explanations are not enough. That India adopted democracy in 1950 before capitalism (in 1991) is also significant because democracy's redistributive pressures, such as free power to farmers and other subsidies, have dampened growth and also explain why India's reform process has been so painfully slow. Economists also find it puzzling why the liberal institutions of the British Raj did not engender faster growth during the colonial years. The rule of law, the relative peace of Pax Brittanica, a non-dirigiste administration, the railways and canals—all these were market friendly moves, after all.

I believe that national confidence also plays an important role. The more damaging impact of colonialism may well have been to Indian minds—it created an inferiority complex from which they have only recently recovered. Douglass North has rightly emphasized the importance of beliefs.6Businessmen understand the value of confidence in entrepreneurial success and in creating a climate for investment; Historians too emphasize the power of self-belief in national success--Roman history and Britain's rise in the 19th century are examples of this. After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose, especially as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism damaged that confidence. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, confidence returned and young Indian minds finally became decolonized. I traveled extensively across India in the 1990's when I discovered this changed mood, and I think it also explains the current economic success.7

I shall now amplify my arguments by taking the reader on a galloping tour of Indian economic history. From this story I shall draw lessons about the role of institutions and culture in development. En passant, I shall touch upon the great questions of Indian history: did the British impoverish India? Why didn't the railways engender an industrial revolution? Did Nehru's socialism dampen India's progress? What is the consequence of democracy preceding capitalism?

Let's begin with the Mughals

India's nationalist historians have portrayed its pre-colonial economy as a golden age of prosperity, and this fabulous wealth set the Europeans on their great voyages of discovery.8 During the Mughal Empire at the end of the 16th century, India's wealth did indeed sustain more than 100 million people. With plenty of arable land, its agriculture was certainly as productive as Western Europe's, and even the subsistence-oriented peasant got a decent return.9 India also had a large, skilled workforce that produced not only cotton but also luxuries for the aristocracy. Consequently, the economy produced a large financial surplus, which was used to support the growing Mughal Empire and finance spectacular monuments like the Taj Mahal.10

In 1497, the Portuguese sent Vasco da Gama with a flotilla of four ships to find India's wealth. But the two-year voyage was not a commercial success and the Indians were not interested in European clothes and goods for they made far ones in India. But Da Gama told King Manuel of Portugal of large cities, large buildings and rivers, and great populations. He spoke about spices and jewels, precious stones and “mines of gold.” He believed that he had found India's legendary wealth.11

It took the English a hundred years to discover this wealth. Initially, they came to plunder but soon discovered the rewards of trade. They found that India produced the world's best cotton yarn and textiles and in enormous quantities.12 What the Indians wanted in exchange from the Europeans was gold and silver, for which they had an insatiable appetite. Hence, there was a constant flow of gold to India, which absorbed a good deal of the bullion mined by the Spaniards in the New World. Having learned about cotton textiles from India, the English turned the tables, and brought an industrial revolution to Britain, but destroyed the lives of millions of Indian weavers.

India was a leading manufacturer in the 18th century

India was a leading manufacturing country in the world in the early 18th century. It had 22.6 percent share of the world's GDP, which came down to around 16 percent by 1820, closer to its share of world population.13 It had a developed banking system and vigorous merchant capital, with a network of agents, brokers and middlemen. Given the enormous financial surplus, a skilled artisan class, large exports, plenty of arable land and reasonable productivity, the question is why didn't a modern industrial economy emerge in India? Instead, why did India become impoverished?

Despite a dynamic and a growing commercial sector which responded to market forces and extensive foreign trade, the truth is that 18th century India was significantly behind Western Europe in technology, institutions and ideas. Neither an agricultural revolution, nor a scientific revolution had occurred, and in the long run the manual skill of the Indian artisan could be no substitute for technological progress,”14 and this would have needed new attitudes. Notwithstanding the surplus and the trade, mid-eighteenth India had a “per capita product perhaps two-thirds of that in England and France.”15

There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor. One explanation is that even in the 18th century India had a large population and plenty of cheap labor. Prosperity comes with rising productivity and a rise in productivity depends on technology. When the supply of labor is elastic, it is more economical to hire people than to invest in machines. Hence, an Englishman observed in 1807, “In India it is seldom that an attempt is made to accomplish anything by machinery that can be performed by human labour.”16 There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor.

Did the British Raj impoverish India?

India's nationalist historians have blamed the British Raj for India's poverty. The classic nationalist case is that India had been rich before the British came and colonialism weakened agriculture and “deindustrialized” India, throwing millions of artisans out of work. Britain's trade policies encouraged the import of manufactures and the export of raw materials; finally, it drained the wealth of India by transferring its capital to Britain.

Nationalists claimed that Lancashire's new textile mills crushed India's handloom textile industry and threw millions of weavers out of work. India's textile exports plunged from a leadership position before the start of the Britain's Industrial Revolution to a fraction. The indigenous banking system, which financed these exports, was also destroyed. Since the colonial government did not erect tariff barriers, Indian consumers shifted to cheaper English mill-made cloth and millions of handloom workers where left in misery. British colonial rule “de-industrialised” India (a favorite nationalist phrase) and from an exporter of textiles, India became an exporter of raw cotton.17

Britain also changed the old land revenue system to the disadvantage of the farmer, who had to now pay revenue whether or not the monsoon failed. This led to famines. The worst one in 1896-97 affected 96 million lives and killed an estimated 5 million people. Although the railways helped in the trade of food crops, the enlarged national market sucked away the peasant's surplus, which he had earlier stored for the bad years. Moreover, the British government transferred its surplus revenues back to England. Since India consistently exported more then she imported in the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century, Britain used India's trade surplus to finance her own trade deficit with the rest of the world, to pay for her exports to India, and for capital repayments in London. This represented a massive drain of India's wealth.18

In recent years some historians have challenged this nationalist picture. They have argued that Indian industry's decline in the 19th century was caused by technology. The machines of Britain's industrial revolution wiped out Indian textiles, in the same way that traditional handmade textiles disappeared in Europe and the rest of the world. Fifty years later Indian textile mills would have destroyed them. India's weavers were, thus, the victims of technological obsolescence.19

They also found that the land tax had not been exorbitant—by 1900 it was only 5 percent of the agricultural output or half the average per capita tax burden. There had been a “drain of wealth”, but it was only about 1.5 percent of GNP every year. The revisionist historians argued that India's payments to Britain were for real military and civilian services and to service capital investments. Also, the overhead cost of the British establishment—the so called “home charges”—was in fact quite small.20 If India had its own army and navy it would have spent more. True, India did have a balance of payments surplus, which Britain used to finance part of her deficit, but India was compensated by the import of gold and silver that went into private Indian hands.

India begins to re-industrize

Indian entrepreneurs began to set up their own modern textile mills after 1850 and very slowly began to recapture the domestic market. In 1896, Indian mills supplied 8% of the total cloth consumed in India; in 1913, 20%; in 1936, 62%; and by 1945, 76%.21Although India did not participate in global trade expansion between 1870 and 1913, Indian businessmen made large profits during the First World War, which they reinvested in after the war. Thus, India's manufacturing output grew 5.6 percent per year between 1913-38, well above the world average of 3.3 percent.” 22 The British government finally provided tariff protection from the 1920s, which helped industrialists to expand and diversify.

By Independence in 1947, Indian entrepreneurs were strong and in a position to buy out the businesses of the departing British. Industry's share in India's GNP had doubled from 3.8 percent (in 1913) to 7.5 percent (in 1947), and the share of manufactures in her exports rose from 22.4 percent (in 1913) to 30 percent (in 1947).

Why didn't an industrial revolution occur?

One of the intriguing questions of history is why India failed to create an industrial revolution. Karl Marx predicted that the railways would transform India and usher in an industrial revolution. Indeed, by the First World War, some thought that it was ready to take-off. By 1914, India had the third largest railway network, the world's largest jute manufacturing industry, the fourth largest cotton textile industry, the largest canal system, and 2.5 percent of world trade.23Although a colony, it had a very liberal regulatory regime--far more investor friendly than the one that replaced it after Independence—and after the 1920s the infant industry was also favored by tariffs. It had a merchant class hungry to become industrialists. Industrialization did, in fact, pick up after the War and industry's share in national output doubled. But it was not enough to broadly transform an agricultural society. Modern industry employed only 2.5 million people out of population of 350 million.

Amiya Kumar Bagchi, the Marxist economist, suggests that the reason was the lack of effective demand during the colonial period, and this limited business opportunity. Indians were just too poor to buy modern goods and services.24 If the domestic Indian market was small, couldn't the entrepreneur have supplemented it by producing for export? Morris D. Morris, blames supply constraints.25 An Indian entrepreneur was uncompetitive because of a shortage of technology, skilled labor, and capital—all of which raised his cost of his production. The historian, Rajat Ray, argues that Indian businessmen did not export because they made inferior products, unacceptable to the world market. In his view, technological backwardness was the single biggest failing.26 But surely, they could have imported technology, as Jamshedji Tata, G.D. Birla, and others did.

Unlike nationalist historians, I do not think there was a British conspiracy to deliberately under-invest in India or sabotage Indian business interests. Bombay's textile mills were built with the credit, technical assistance and machines from Britain although they were a competitive threat to the Manchester's mills. I believe the industrial revolution did not occur because Indian agriculture remained stagnant, and you cannot have an industrial revolution without an agricultural surplus or the means to feed a rapidly growing urban population; second, the international trading environment turned hostile with protectionism after the First World War, followed by the Depression; third, the colonial government did not educate the masses, unlike the Japanese state; finally, a colonial mindset pervaded the Indian middle class--even the hardiest potential entrepreneur lacks confidence when he is politically enslaved.

What is the verdict on British rule?

Did the British impoverish India? There is no question that in the 18th century it plundered and looted India's wealth, as all conquerors have done in history. But did it create on-going institutions that were to India's detriment? This has to do with the nature and theory of colonialism. True, its Industrial Revolution threw millions of weavers out of work, but it would have happened any way when the new technology reached India. British government policy could have cushioned the impact by erecting trade barriers and saved enormous amount of human suffering, but protecting handlooms would have been a temporary palliative.

Odd as it may seem, I believe that Britain did not “exploit” India enough. Had it made the massive investments in India that it did in the Americas, India would have become more prosperous and a much bigger market for British goods. A richer India would have been a better customer, a better supplier, and a firmer basis of Empire.27 Britain's main failure was not to educate the Indian masses—hence 83 percent of Indians were illiterate at Independence. Britain's education system in India produced only a thin upper crust of extremely well educated Indians, while the masses remained illiterate.28

Although Britain could not lift Indians out of poverty, nor avert famines, it did give India the institutions of democracy--the rule of law, an independent judiciary and a free press. It built railways, canals, and harbors. It gave India almost a hundred years of peace—the Pax Britannica. Although it gave modern values and institutions, it did not interfere with its ancient traditions and religion. Hence, India has preserved its spiritual heritage and the old way of life continues. Many despair over the divisiveness of caste, but the hold of the Indian way of life is also a bulwark against the onslaught of the global culture.

Independence and 'License Raj'

After Independence, democracy took root in India and gradually the masses acquired a stake in the system, periodically electing representatives even from the lowest castes. The rulers also adopted a Fabian socialist economic path, and Indians did not turn to capitalism until 1991, although there was modest liberalization of the economy in the 1980s. Thus, India embraced democracy before capitalism, which makes its journey to modernity unique and explains a good deal.

Jawaharlal Nehru and his planners did not trust private entrepreneurs; so they made the state the entrepreneur, and not surprisingly, they failed to create an industrial revolution. Instead, India experienced an agricultural revolution in the early 1970s. It thus had an important pre-condition for the industrial revolution—an agricultural surplus—but the industrial take-off eluded it. Its investment rate also rose from 6 percent to well over 20 per cent, and yet it did not engender a take-off. Why?

I think there were at least six things wrong with India's mantra: one, it adopted an inward-looking, import-substituting path rather than an outward-looking, export-promoting route; it thus denied itself a share in world trade and the prosperity that trade brought in the post-War era. Two, it set up a massive, inefficient, and monopolistic public sector to which it denied autonomy of working; hence, its investments were not productive and it had a poor capital-output ratio. Three, it over-regulated private enterprise with the worst controls in the world, and this diminished competition in the market; four, it discouraged foreign capital and denied itself the benefits of technology and world class competition. Five, it pampered organized labor to the point that it has extremely low productivity. Six, it ignored the education of its children.

Nehru's strategic planner, P.C. Mahalanobis, made two wrong assumptions. He assumed that there were no opportunities for rapid export expansion in the 1950s, and this turned out to be wrong. India discovered that tiny Hong Kong could earn more from its exports than the whole of India, as India's share of world trade declined from 2.2 percent in 1947 to 0.5 percent in 1990. He also assumed that competition was wasteful, and this was also a flawed idea because there can be little improvement in productivity without it.

Even more damaging were the creeping controls on the private sector. The most bizarre was the licensing system. It began with the Industrial Licensing Act of 1951, which required an entrepreneur to get a license to set up a new unit, to expand it, or change the product mix. A huge number of untrained clerks, engineers, bureaucrats at the Directorate General of Technical Development, operating on the basis of inadequate information vetted thousands of applications on an ad hoc basis. These low level functionaries took months in the futile, micro-review of an application and finally sent it for approval to the administrative ministry. The ministry again lost months reviewing the same data before it sent the application to an inter-ministerial licensing committee. After the Minister's approval, the investor had to seek approval for the import of machinery from the capital goods licensing committee. If finance was needed from a State financial institution, the same scrutiny had to be repeated afresh. The result was enormous delays, sometimes lasting years with staggering opportunities for corruption.

Large business houses set up parallel bureaucracies in Delhi, to follow up on their files, organize bribes, and win licenses. If the entrepreneur did finally get started and made a success of his enterprise, he was again in trouble. It was an offence punishable under the law to manufacture beyond the capacity granted by the license. India became the only country in the world where the production of sorely needed goods sorely was punishable by law.29

The system ended in thwarting competition, entrepreneurship and growth, without achieving any of its social objectives. It fostered monopolies and it proliferated uneconomic-size plants in remote, uncompetitive locations, employing second-rate technology. Bureaucrats who did not have a clue about the basics of running a business made the decisions on the choice of technology, the size and location of plants.

Although it was becoming clear that India was on the wrong path by the late sixties, instead of changing course after Nehru, Indira Gandhi introduced more controls. She nationalized banks, discouraged foreign investment, and placed more hurdles before domestic enterprise. Hence, industrial growth plunged from 7.7 per cent a year between 1951-1965 to 4.0 per cent between 1966-1980. Productivity of Indian manufacturing declined half a percent a year from 1960 to 1985.30

“1966-1980 is effectively the dark period for the Indian economy.”31. It is harder to blame Nehru for adopting the economic wrong model for socialism was the wisdom of his age and dozens of economists visited India and hailed his bold experiment.32 It is right to blame Indira Gandhi, for by then Japan's miracle was evident, and Korea and Taiwan were following its footsteps. However, ideology is only one part of the story. An important reason for non-performance was poor implementation. Even Nehru's socialism could have delivered more and did not have to degenerate into “License Raj”.

India after the Reforms

Although there was modest liberalization in the 1980s, the decisive turning point came in July 1991 when the minority government of Narasimha Rao announced sweeping reforms. It opened the economy to foreign investment and trade; it dismantled import controls, lowered customs duties, devalued the currency and made the rupee convertible on the trade account; it virtually abolished licensing controls on private investment, dropped tax rates and broke public sector monopolies. As a result growth rose to 7.5 percent a year for three years in a row in the mid-nineties, inflation came down from 13 percent to 6 percent by 1993, exchange reserves shot up from $1 billion to $20 billion by 1993, and had crossed $100 billion by end 2003. This was as important a turning point as Deng's revolution in China in December 1978. Surprisingly, the elected coalition governments that succeeded Rao continued the reform process, and despite its slow, incremental pace, it has made India one of the fastest growing major economies in the world.33

Indians have traditionally not accorded a high place to making money. Hence, the merchant or bania is placed third in the four-caste hierarchy, behind the brahmin and the kshatriya, and only a step ahead of the laboring shudra. After the economic reforms making money became increasingly respectable and the sons of brahmins and kshatriyas began to get MBAs and wanted to become entrepreneurs. The business pages of newspapers became livelier; chief ministers in the states scrambled for private investment; judges became more even-handed in industrial disputes. As a result, India is in the midst of a social revolution rivalled, perhaps, only by the ascent of Japan's merchant class during the 1968 Meiji Restoration.

There has also been mental revolution. And a changed attitude to English illustrates this new mindset. Ever since the British left Indians constantly carped against the English language. But in the 1990s this carping seemed to die, and quietly, without ceremony English became one of the Indian languages. English lost its colonial stigma, oddly enough, around the time that the Hindu nationalists came to power. Young Indians in the new middle class think of English as a skill, like Windows. This is why Hinglish (Hindi mixed with English) is spreading. Encouraged by flourishing private television channels and supported by their advertisers, the newly emerging middle classes avidly embrace this uninhibited hybrid of Hindi and English, and this popular idiom of the bazaar is rushing down the socio-economic ladder. The purists naturally disapprove, but people are more comfortable and accepting of it today because Indians are more relaxed and confident as a people. Their minds have become decolonized.

The world, meanwhile, also changed from an industrial to the information economy, and it seemed to speak to India's advantage, symbolized by its success in software and business process outsourcing. These “Bangalores” have given Indians confidence and they reflect a new social contract. The new entrepreneurs did not inherit wealth; they have risen on the back of their talent, hard work, and professional skills. A new self-belief has emerged among urban youth that doesn't need approval from others, especially from the West. Music composers like A.R. Rehman display an exuberant nonchalance, as do the new young Bollywood pop stars. So do new fiction writers like Arundhati Roy, designers of fashion clothes, beauty queens and cricket stars.

Some lessons

Neoclassical economic theory explains a great deal about why the Indian economy that was stagnating in the first half of the 20th century went on to become one of the fastest growing by the end of the century. It tells us, for example, that disgraceful protectionism by governments in the inter-war years in the first half of the 20th century dampened world trade and slowed down the world and the Indian economies. It also explains why India performed below the world average between 1950-1980: thinking that trade had impoverished her in the colonial period, India closed its economy and denied itself the fruits of a “golden period” in world trade between 1950 and 1970; “License Raj” and other institutions of Nehru's socialism also suppressed growth. Finally, neoclassical economics explains how by dismantling controls and integrating the economy with the global economy, the Indian economy has become more competitive and is growing rapidly after the reforms.

But this is not the whole story, and we must turn to institutions and attitudes to understand the incentive structure of the Indian society.60 Indians blame colonialism for impoverishing them. But we have seen that colonialism is a more complex tale. For example, it did not 'de-industrialize' India as the nationalists argued; handloom textiles died in India (and the world) because of technological obsolescence. Colonialism's bigger damage was to the loss of Indian confidence, which inhibited Indian entrepreneurs. This confidence began to grow with Gandhi's freedom movement in the first half of the 20th century, and industrialization did pick up. However, its impact on society was insufficient to create an industrial revolution.

After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism acted as a damper. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, self-assurance returned to the Indian marketplace. Today's mood in India is opposite to what existed a hundred years ago. Insecurity and inferiority filled colonial India, which is all too apparent in the writings of Bengali writers of the 19th century, such as Bankim Chandra Chatterji. Today, writers like Salman Rushdie and Arundhati Roy exhibit a matter of fact assuredness (almost a cool) that is a reflection of changed national mindset.

India embraced democracy first and capitalism afterwards and this has made a difference. India became a full-fledged democracy in 1950, with universal suffrage and extensive human rights, but it was not until 1991 that it opened up to the free play of market forces. For the rest of the world it has been the other way around. In the West, suffrage was extended gradually in the last century, and as mass political parties developed, democracy began to impinge on capitalist institutions and practices.

India's democracy has an overwhelming majority of poor voters--70 per cent still live in rural areas; organized labor constitutes less than 10 per cent of total labor; and the middle class is around 20 per cent of the population. Because of democratic pressures, India tried to redistribute the pie before it was baked. It set up intricate regulatory networks before the private economy had transformed a rural into an industrial society. It began to think in terms of “welfare” before there were welfare-generating jobs. The result, as we have seen, was a throttling of enterprise, slow growth, and missed opportunities. It is the price India has paid for having democracy before capitalism—or rather too much democracy and not enough capitalism.

Since politics is a short run game and growth is a long run one there will never be a situation that is completely optimal. This explains why Indian politicians do not bother about education because results take a long time to come. When a politician promises rice for two rupees a kilo when it costs five rupees in the market, he wins the election. Since the mid-1960s politicians have vigorously competed in giving away free goods and services to voters. When politicians do that, where is the money to come for creating schools or improving old ones? India's damaging fiscal deficit (around 10 percent of GDP for the center and states combined) is a testimonial to the downside of competitive politics, and it teaches that the demand for publicly provided goods and services is insatiable in a democracy.

But India's problems of governance go far beyond the need to appease interests. The weakening of its democratic institutions since Indira Gandhi in the 1970s has caused widespread corruption, political violence, populist giveaways, and a paralysis of problem solving. Conspicuously absent are disciplined party organizations, which help leaders in other democracies to mobilize support for specific programs. Hence, there is an excessive reliance on the personal appeal of individual leaders to win elections. When in power leaders tend to take the easy way out, which is not to act at all.

Will capitalism, and its cousin globalization succeed in establishing a comfortable place for themselves in India? The answer depends on their ability to deliver prosperity broadly. It also depends on leaders in the government and in business to champion the classic liberal premises of free trade and competition. It needs leaders to come out say that (1) some people will not fare as well in the competitive market place; (2) the winners will far outnumber the losers; (2) capitalist democracy is the best arrangement we have found; (4) globalization is not only a good thing, it is a great leap forward in history. My fear is that capitalism's success in India is threatened not so much by the leftists or protectionists but by the timidity of its defenders.

The curious historic inversion between democracy and capitalism means that India's path into the future is evolving through a daily dialogue between the conservative forces of caste, religion and the village, the leftist and Nehruvian socialist forces which dominated the intellectual life of the country for 40 years, and the new forces of global capitalism. These “million negotiations of democracy” slow down the pace of economic reforms, but they also mean that India might have a more stable, peaceful, and negotiated transition into the future than say China. It might also avoid some of the deleterious side effects of an unprepared capitalist society, such as Russia. Although slower, India is more likely to preserve its way of life and it's civilization of diversity, tolerance, and spirituality against the onslaught of the global culture.

Does culture matter?

Cultural explanations have been a vigorous industry in India for more than a hundred years. Colonial officials routinely blamed India's poverty on the otherworldly spirituality of Hindu life and its fatalistic beliefs. Max Weber attributed the absence of development to the caste system. Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist, found that India's social system and attitudes were an important cause of its “low level equilibrium” of low productivity, primitive production techniques, and low levels of living.34

Deepak Lal, another economist, similarly explained economic stagnation in a low level “Hindu equilibrium” around the caste system, which bought stability in the context of political warfare, monsoon failure and climatic uncertainty, labor shortage, and an under-valued merchant class.35 David Landes, the historian, blames the enervating heat, which is deleterious to work. For this reason, rich countries lie in temperate zones and the poor in the tropics and semi-tropics.36

While institutions and culture do matter undoubtedly, we are all skeptical of national stereotypes and easy cultural explanations of the sort that were common hundred years ago. In my experience, successful Hindu entrepreneurs can be both extremely otherworldly in religion and aggressive in business. The Indian farmer, despite being caught in the caste system, responds quickly to market based incentives, as the Green Revolution testifies. Brahmins, who are supposed to have contempt for manual labor, will plough their land vigorously if they have to. And Rajput Thakurs, who never worked for a living, will shed their feudal ways for the sake of a commercial opportunity. Moreover, there are substantial non-Hindus in India and these communities had also been stuck in the same rut of stagnation. Other Asian countries were equally backward, but they had no “Hindu equilibrium” to explain away their stagnation. Finally, the same Indians when they migrate to other countries perform better.

Thus, I am uncomfortable with the “otherworldly values of the Hindus” or the “immobilizing effects of the caste system” and the “conservative habits of the merchant caste”. I believe that Sir John Hicks' Economic Principle does trump in most cases. It states that “people would act economically; when the opportunity of an advantage was presented to them they would take it.”37 It explains not only the diffusion of the Green Revolution across India but also the demographic transitions currently underway in many states.

When seeking an explanation for a nation's wealth and poverty, my preferred method is to begin with economic factors as proximate causes that motivate a businessman to invest--the size of the market, the capability of suppliers, distribution hurdles, and the state of competition. If this does not satisfy, I seek answers in institutions, some of which are, of course, intimately tied to culture. I have found that institutions can evolve rapidly as incentives change in society and can be transferred fairly quickly; for example, during the 1990s India was able to dismantle many of the institutions of Nehruvian socialism and replace them with capitalist institutions. Finally, if none of these factors provide a satisfactory explanation, then I turn to attitudes and social structure.

I find Deepak Lall's distinction between material and cosmological beliefs useful.38The material beliefs of a civilization are about ways of making a living and are the subject of economics; cosmological ones are about how to live and are in the realm of 'culture'. The rise of the west was accompanied by a change in both sets of beliefs, but East Asia's success has needed mainly a change in material beliefs—it has become prosperous without losing its soul. In other words, it is possible to modernize without westernizing. Ever since the British Raj material beliefs have been changing in India unlike our cosmological beliefs.

Our continuing inability to distinguish between the “modern” and the “western” in India is surely the cause of some of our grief. If we could only accept that a great deal of modern western culture, especially its material beliefs, are not the West's property, but are a universal, critical way of thinking, which belongs to all rational human beings. We would not waste our energies on swadeshi (protectionism) hindutva (preserving the ancient Hindu civilization), and futile language debates (“remove English from primary schools”). The debate between modernisation and westernisation, begun in early nineteenth century by Ram Mohan Roy, continues to rage in India. At the root is a fear of the loss of the Indian way of life. The older generation fears it more than the young, whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the West's material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological ones.


"," Wow. TLDR? [deleted] [deleted] I don't think thats what Tharoor is really talking about. More from the perspective of:- Hitler is taught to be an ""evil"" guy now. In germany as well. Yet, Britain has mostly whitewashed the horrors they've committed in what they teach to their own kids. Continuing the same stuff.  

IMHO, he's raising awareness about the atrocities that they've committed, and thats something I can get behind. I think Tharoor's main goal is to educate the modern Western masses about some of the harsher realities of colonialism, that they conveniently leave out in their history text books. This was an interesting counter narrative as well. Das essentially wrote the same thing in 'India Unbound'. But I don't think it really contradicts Tharoor's claims . Everyone of Das' arguments are well corroborated in partly being responsible for holding ""India"" back but he let's the Brits go Scott free.

Yes, there were individual entrepreneurial success stories (too few benefited). Yes, the European institutions enabled the industrial revolution and yes, the caste system was responsible. But without a ""Indian"" structural head who could've changed things or we could've had an enlightment (a historical what-if), the colonial masters simply gave  no chance for growth. That carries a lot of culpability. 

The drain theory is definitely true. The EIC was paying 400,000 pounds to the crown since 1765 apart from the ""gifts"" to Parliament all sourced from India. They took advantage of Aurgazeb's tax exemption. The Marathas, Nawab of Awadh and Hyderabad's Nizam all had to pay substantial amounts annually to the French and EIC well before 1857. Asaf-ud-daula paid 7.6 million rupees annually just to be recognised Nawab in 1797. The point is, the money could've been spent on subjects or institutions and maybe we wouldn't be as poor as we are now.

A book came out last year called ""Selling Empire: India in the Making of Britain and America, 1600-1830"" which demonstrates the centrality of India--both as an idea and a place--to the making of a global British imperial system. Essentially, the new world was discovered *because* Columbus was searching for riches in India. 

He makes the argument that in the run-up to the American Revolution, the East India Company played a visible and disturbing role. In his view, Americans’ awareness of the Company’s conquests in India, and the establishment of an authoritarian government there, evoked the fear of a shared place for Indians and Americans in a corrupt and “despotic” empire . Following the Revolution, America’s connection with India paradoxically expanded, as reflected in part by the continuing appeal of Indian consumer fashions. Much of it, however, arose fortuitously out of the extended British wars with France from 1794 onward; as a neutral power, the United States was well situated to take advantage of trading opportunities denied to others. By 1806, India had contributed 4 percent of U.S. imports, and Americans commanded much of the Continental European market for Indian goods. 
 >It gave India almost a hundered years of peace. 

I'm done. I wouldn't call 100+ of looting and injustice ""peaceful."" Have read the whole thing.
The Nehruvian disaster is irrelevant for judging the British period.

Taking information from the article itself, I think we can still blame the British for not letting India join the industrial revolution.

This they did by creating:
Low literacy/education (In a modern economy, this alone will mean that you'll fail to compete.)

Unstable political environment/ low confidence (In an uncertain future, why will anyone invest time and capital.) There is a mention of low self confidence and lack of education being the reason Indians didn't moved toward industrialization. And he also mentioned that Indians had no money to buy anything at that time. Then how after 1947 suddenly things could have changed? Isn't these things require time especially a skills gained after education. I think once a generation of Indian educated enough in 1980's they automatically moved towards the industrialization solely on the basis of there skills. And of course we can't deny the poor government policies but I feel completely blaming them isn't right  a thing. Is there something wrong I have understood from this article? Saved for later. Too long to read right now. Let's just sum it up: The British did many good things and bad things.

Personally I'm glad for stuff like outlawing Sati and reforming personal laws which I'm sure most of our post independence governments wouldn't have the guts to touch. Was India ever a rich nation in the first place? People use the 27% of world GDP stat to justify the label but we had 27% of the world population also at that time. 

Both Shashi Tharoor and Gurcharan Das are starting from the flawed premise that we were a rich nation.  Slightly off topic, but I believe much of Tharoor's British bashing is just shrewd political posturing. When he first ran for parliament in 2009, the Nair community voted for him en masse because ""he is one of us"". The educated/liberal class voted for him because he had the ""it"" factor, undersecretary general of the UN, erudite, sophisticated etc. He won handily, with a huge margin. In 2014, a lot of the older Nairs voted BJP because ""they stand for Hindu values"" (evidence for this is anectodal, everyone in my (+wife's) family voted Tharoor in 2009, most of our parents' generation voted BJP in 2014). Tharoor still had the youth/liberal vote and won, but by a margin that was an order of magnitude less compared to 2009. A huge slide. In 2019, he faces the prospect of running against Suresh Gopi (popular actor, current BJP RS MP), and stands a real risk of losing. I consider his anti-Brit stance an attempt at pandering to the nationalistic crowd.

It is really simplistic to claim Britain ""looted"" us or caused millions of deaths due to famine without considering how much of India's wealth was concentrated in the hands of Zamindars, Nawabs and Rajas or taking into account the lives lost in wars between the various kingdoms and city states that dotted the Indian sub-continent before the British brought it all together. Well Tharoor is not completely wrong either. India was rich, maybe not as rich as all those WhatsApp forwards mention like 27% of world GDP and other crap. I also believe that Tharoor's fans are a little bit exaggerating his debates and speeches. I think he's going to use this wave of false patriotism that's been around which makes people patriots on social media, to his advantage in the next elections. I mean - no one really discusses if a robbery is ""overall a good thing"" even if it did help turn someone's life around in a positive way.  > The older generation fears it more than the young, whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the West's material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological ones.

As I've been trying to explain to the languagetards on all sides, accepting English IS decolonization. Glad to see an academic agree. I can drink his urine straight from source Brilliant. Learned a lot about myself and my country...  Brilliant article. Its important to see good arguments from both sides. Thanks for sharing."
111,Non-Political,[Non-Political] Randians help me out with my crush situation,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9rswpz/nonpolitical_randians_help_me_out_with_my_crush/,"I have a crush on this girl in my college. We text daily - memes, study stuffs etc. She shares her secrets to me so she actually trusts me. I love talking to her but the thing is I’m quite a shy guy so my talks and texts are very “friendish” and not like the ones our college studs do and get gfs so fast.  I ask her about her day, make her laugh, help her out but all this seems to have put in the friend zone. 

She recently had a breakup with her ex and she was very down for some time and I tried to support her as much as I could. Now it seems that she’s not ready for any relationship at all. I understand she’ll need some time but what can I do to make her look at me not just as a friend?  Can’t really ask her to go on a date or something because we both are day scholars and this is a town in india we’re talking about.

Please give any tips or advice you have. This will be my first relationship and I really want this so I just wanna make sure I don’t ruin this. Thanks."," पढ़ाई पर ध्यान दो! exactly my story 6 years ago

1. ladki ka just breakup hua: check
2. relationship ke liye tayaar nahi: check
3. i was a shy boy: check
4. i am assuming she ll fall in love with me someday: check
5. i was her tampon: check

exactly, thats what you'll be: a tampon, learnt that the hard way, quit her in 2015 after getting tired of her back and forth bullshit and uncertainty, she ll keep you locked but she wont say say, fuck that shit man, no one s got time for that... She sees you as a friend and has made it clear that she is not interested in you for anything intimate. It's best for you to use your emotions somewhere else. If you don't believe me then ask her clearly, saying hey <her name>, do you think we two could be together as a couple. She will give you a straight no. Start flirting with her. Take it slowly but definitely let her get the hint that you are interested in being more than just friends with her. You have hidden your intentions so far out of fear and maintaining this act is not going to help you. Some Chad might come into her life and take her away from you. If you don't tell her she'll never know. She also might have feelings for you that you don't know about. Be brave and tell her that you like her, but be subtle about it. See how she responds and then take it from there. Itna sudhra hua na Bano ki saamne vaale ko lage ki asexual ho Stop being her gay BFF and ask her out already. Otherwise, like the other guy said, emotional tampon bane reh jaoge. She will use your shoulder to cry on and find some other guy's dick to ride on.

I know it sounds rude, but its just the way the world works. Always better to learn the lesson early in life. Tell her your feelings either she says yes or friendship ends. Or she knows and keeps the friendship which is painful. And everyone knows.

(non-political)",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8ius6e/rant_do_we_deserve_what_we_have_or_do_we_have/,"Ok, so my classmate from school got a new Mercedes S class. She or her parents didn't buy it, her fiancé gifted it to her. **What does he do?** He acted in a flop movie, his dad owns businesses. **What does she do?** She is jobless since her graduation. Her dad is a lawyer I think, (not sure). But I wouldn't say her family income is significantly greater than mine. For all I know, it might be lesser. At every point in time, I worked my ass off. She, not so much. She's got some rich dude now, and suddenly her life has upgraded a million times.

After a very ugly breakup 4-5 years ago, I extremely hated every female on the planet. It took me months to come out of such unreasoned hatred. But this is the 3rd time one of my childhood friends is marrying a rich dude. I know it is not wrong, but it totally kills off any motivation for doing better in life. This unfair advantage girls have over guys is reinforcing my reasons to hate girls.

I know not all girls are like that. My ex bought a Honda Amaze on her own, by working her ass off and paying EMIs. My friend from university bought a Tesla. But every day, you hear one of your friends say things about girls which only reinforces the belief that girls are gold-diggers. Are they really that pretty? some are but not all. But despite working so hard in almost every aspect of life, a girl from next bench who hasn't worked at all is getting everything I desired. Then why did I work hard? Why should I from now on? What can I say, I'll marry a girl and would be able to afford a vada-pav may be?"," There are guys who marry for job/wealth and stuff as well. Life is unfair if you compare yourself with others. You gotta do what you gotta do. Idk who even told you life is fair. Hardwork leads to success. But hard work isn't the only way to success.

You're totally disregarding the fact that guys get dowry. My neighbor works at a bank as a Junior Officer on Contract. He gets 20k per month and his job isn't even permanent. But he lives in a house that costs a crore and a half, drives a car that costs close to a crore and has a bike that costs 20 lakhs!

And he's not an outlier, the dowry given over here are huge and its there everywhere. My mother's friends boast off about how their son got acres of land , houses and expensive watches in dowry. All their sons are average engineering folks from a tier 3 college working for an IT company. :3 Bhai do you have any idea how much guys get in dowry? Their whole life revolves around getting a good job so their family can extort good dowry from girl's family. They get inherited bunglows, cars, fridge, TV, washing machine, expensive gifts etc you name it, and this is out of compulsion. What your friend got was a gift, she didn't ask for it. This way, men are bigger gold diggers. Stop acting like the world owes you anything. Life isn't supposed to be served on a silver platter. You're making excuses for your own incompetence. Life is unfair, dude. That's the simplest way to look at it. I feel like you quite a lot, but then what makes me stop thinking this way is when I see daily wage laborers or these people who do odd jobs, no matter how hard they work, they will never have a comfortable life. I start to think, how would they feel when they look at us.

I'm not undermining what you are feeling by saying the last thing. Like I said, I feel the same way, but yeah. Life is unfair. Hi.

I feel you.

I really do.
An ex of mine left me for a richer dude. It shattered me to pieces. I was devastated. There was no motivation for a good while. I was cutting myself ( I hate people who do it, it achieves nothing, just like suicide).

I know what you're going through.

I find solace in the fact that no one can point at me and say ' Baap ka paisa'. 

I made myself. You'll too. 

Men want just one thing dude. And that one thing is disgusting. Men just want Man Samman.

Its all that will ever matter.

I hope this helped. Life is different for everybody and in every aspect. Why wasting time and mindfulness on comparing yourself to someone else. What do you want? What will you have to do to achieve it? Fuck rest of the world and work on that.

And yes, please change the scale which you use to measure happiness. A Mercedes is happiness for 2 days. Inner satisfaction is the key. Get their. Life doesn’t owe you anything. Life doesn’t have to be fair, life doesn’t have to be unfair. It is what it is. There is no logic or rewards systems with life. Sometimes you get what you deserve and other times you don’t, this can either be good or bad. 

All you can do is, put in your best and hope you don’t get a hot pile of shit in return. C’est la vie. "

115,Non-Political,[Non-Political] Vodafone had been extorting my balance for the past 2 months and blocking my calls to their customer care number.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6t66al/nonpolitical_vodafone_had_been_extorting_my/,"So for the past 2 months Vodafone has been tormenting me. Last month there was a series of deductions from my balance amount for the so called VAS, none for which I have requested. Activation of VAS went on for 3 weeks in which.I lost amount 5 to 9 rupees and each happens on a day to day basis. I was refunded the first two times. But, as it started happening on a daily basis, I was denied access to  their customer  care dept.( It was denied because, i was able to connect them through other Vodafone numbers)

 I took resort in Twitter and contacted them . They did reply instantly with a message that their executive will be calling as soon as possible. None of those people called. ( I continued pestering them for two days, still those hyprocrites were in connivance).
Only after emailing and doing MNP message , i got calls from Vodafone to ask why i did the MNP messages.( they wanted to know what made me to port from their network [and after all these calls and tweets] SMH).  They did refund ,but only after 2 emails, 10 tweets, and 3 calls from another number.

So , that was last month. Yesterday , I unknowingly used up my 1 GB data pack along with my remaining balance . As usual, I proceeded to recharge through Paytm. Surprise!!! processing failed!! one, two, three, leave it,  six times, the processing failed. Tried with the Vodafone App, nope!! all the tranaction pages starting showing 'Request page cannot be processed ' messages( data packs can be activated  but no talktime ones)Tried calling their customer care, again surprise!! call doesnt go through.

Has anyone got any idea why those hypocrites are doing this to me. Is there any way I can sue them for my hassles? 

"," Send the Port message. They will immediately call you. I had this problem a lot. I was skeptical at first but it turned out that it was an App that had ads which would get activated even though I didn't tap on them. It was Boost For Reddit in my case. Now I avoid using it. Are you using any app that has ads at the bottom?  I am in the same boat as you, except I have postpaid. I emailed them and  threatened to not pay the bill and threatened to go to their competitiors if they continue the nonsense of adding VAS charges (which they added 366 rupees this month when my usual bill is 360 Rupees!). They said they will credit the same in the next bill cycle. I suspect they are lying. So I shot back an email saying I want it done for the bill I am about to pay this month. It looks like they have obliged. But, I won't be sticking around with them anymore. They do it all the time. Register a written complaint via email, it works everytime, also it means that those who cannot send email and are not assertive enough (read most of the people) will not get there balance back and will have to way to stop further wrongful deductions. I think this is deliberate and standard operating procedure of the telcos. They do it all the time.

The governments of 1977-1979 and 1998-2004 became possible only because the RSS agreed to keep out of sight**.

> ... **Cut to 1949 and the RSS’s undertaking to Patel to write a constitution, which, among other things, would specify that the Sangh had “no politics” and would remain “devoted purely to cultural work” (Article 4(b) of the RSS constitution; D.R. Goyal, 1979). The written constitution was Patel’s pre-condition for lifting the ban imposed on the RSS in the wake of Mahatma Gandhi’s January 30, 1948 assassination**.

Further, the note quoted information received from the provincial governments, which showed “**that the activities carried on in various forms and ways by the people associated with the RSS tend to be anti-national and often subversive and violent and that persistent attempts are being made by the RSS to revive an atmosphere in the country which was productive of such disastrous consequences in the past…**”

> ... The letter of September 11, 1948, was to Golwalkar himself. In this Patel lauded the RSS for its service to Hindu society even as he outlined the “**objectionable part**” which “**arose when they, burning with revenge, began attacking Mussalmaans …” Further, “As a final result of the (communal) poison, the country had to suffer the sacrifice of the invaluable life of Gandhiji …**” Patel said people’s opposition to the RSS grew when “**the RSS men expressed joy and distributed sweets after Gandhiji’s death.**” Well. Power corrupts. And absolute power corrupts absolutely.  (Don’t remember who said that, but it fits here) Any lawyers around? Is it possible for a court to cast out the leadership of RSS and give control of the organization to an external administration? If an organization is clearly in breach of its charter and principles, and the current governance structure takes no notice.. surely that’s grounds for dismissing the leadership?

 1. Indian consumers dont care about quality.

2. As someone who travels frequently for work in India and abroad, I have observed enough times to know that Indian tourists and travelers are, in one word - impolite - to travel with. And this is true for all sorts of transport. 

There will always be exceptions to this but they're few. Almost negligible. 

 Indian girls are the worst for dating and fucking. Like they are confused between wanting a boyfriend and a husband and an ATM.

Somehow if you are a lady, you automatically get some privileges. And if you protest, people think you are a rapist or a molester.

Religion needs to be stopped from turning us back into 5th century. Slam poetry in India is shit and serves no purpose whatsoever. Upbringing of indian kids have gone shit these days.

Its not a flair option unless you spend 24x7 on /r/india I don't see it as a big deal  Humor can be political or unpolitical. So no. Nope, I like the way it is now. I love how everyone gets tricked by its headlines.

Also the article on Manipur deserves to be on the frontpage. They used satire in a smart way to draw attention to a serious issue which got neglected by the media. Divert faking news to /r/bakchodi  I find the 'Political' tag fairly apt for Faking News these days. It's become a propaganda site. Instead of ""humor"", I'd suggest ""satire"" flair if it's too necessary. Under humor flair, shitty Whatsapp political images about ""pappu, feku and bhagoda"" will get posted and just degrade the sub. I was just going to post this. It should be a ""satire"" flair.

128,Non-Political,[Non Political][Serious]To all Indian women: What do you think of an Indian guy who has payed for sex? Would you marry him?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4cdae5/non_politicalseriousto_all_indian_women_what_do/,I know this is a re-post of the question. I accidentally deleted the question. I am not trying to troll anyone. I am genuinely looking for opinions. ," Hahahahahahahah you actually think there are women on Randia?

And if they are, they'd risk replying to you? DAILY SAXX THREAD strangely all males are answering this question which has been addressed for females specifically payed....?? [deleted] I honestly find it a bit sad. No, I wouldn't date or marry him.  I would marry a girl who is a prostitute if I love her. There is your answer.

And paying for sex doesn't make you any different from a normal guy, if a girl is turned off by this, she is too narrow minded don't marry her. It's a societal jinx, the catch 22/ Pandora's box.

When we are young we are brash and we do things which we wouldn't otherwise, no one should hold that against you.  High quality Red Pill stuff and quite cliche as well.. But I shall still repeat: 'Men use love to get sex and women use sex for getting love'. 

I don't think women would mind her guy indulging into emotionless sex.. Its the romantic involvement of men with other women which pisses her off.. But again, its not a thumb rule. Over possessive women can create a tantrum and ruin it. 

 [deleted] well women can have sex if they want it.Finding a partner is no big deal but for a guy it is. Its not that easy.    I think it's disgusting, so no. Can't marry someone whose morals don't match yours.  girl here..It would be a huge turn off. It is a sign that he is not able to attract women. It is an almost deal breaker Do you really think marrying means you're not paying for sex? Nice try lol When a girl/boy is blindly in love, it doesn't what the partner has done in the past. She/he will even put up with his carelessness, brash attitude etc., all in the name of love.       This type of question arises partly because of the ""arranged married"" background where a lot of ""judging"" happens before two people actually gets to know each other. 

Perhaps if 'arranged marriages' never happened in India, this question would be like 'do you knowingly date a guy who has paid for sex before'. Which is again an individual choice, but since you wouldn't know if a person has done that or not without getting to know that person a lot, you will be better placed to make a good call knowing all aspects of that person (rather than if they are X cast, gothra, and how strong/week is their family and what not). Dude if you want a genuine answer, ask this question on Quora and not Reddit. 

 [deleted] i'd say the context is important.  i can't say one way or another until i know more details.  in the end, if it is all in the past and the baggage is lost, one may perhaps be persuaded to move on.  

i'd also be interested to know what the guy feels about marrying a woman who has received money to have sex.  A friend of mine(he says the story was about a friend, but he knows too many details). A close friend of mine told me he lost his virginity this way. I am actually quite proud of him. If the urge is too strong, go pay someone and do it consentually. 

And if you want to know, yes I do find him attractive.  Having had a chat with many women about this subject, let me offer a perspective. 

The responses you will get will be most likely be negative. Said guy is a loser, etc or on the SJW side - oppression of women and what not.

However, the deeper reason for this is defensive feelings which arise from the fact that prostitution simply puts a price on pussy, and takes away all the enigma and value from it. 

Men chase women and jump through hoops for them and put up with a lot of their bullshit with the ultimate goal of sleeping with them at some point or continuing to sleep with them. Acting as gatekeepers of sex is the 'power' that women have in a male dominated society, and to every woman, in her head, to get sex from her a man must be 'worthy' of it and must do things to remain worthy. 

Now what if, men suddenly stopped caring, and just bought their way into pussy anywhere from 3000 - 20000 bucks a pop? It completely negates the power they have, and hence they feel defensive and would want to dismiss/discredit such men in any way possible. [deleted] [deleted] If the roles are reserved, then no. If a girl has to pay for sex, then either she is too ugly to get any dick or too slutty, not getting enough dicks. Either case, not worth it.

And if a guy fucks a pros, I don't think it is a problem unless you get STDs or something. People falling in love with prostitutes is not that common, as bollywood makes you believe. Girl here. I have a friend who's paid for sex before, does it occasionally.   
  
Answering this would be tough for anyone because the industry is largely exploitative, but without customers those women don't have an income and are left more vulnerable to exploitation and poverty. The job and its income gives (some) women (some sort of) financial independence.   
  
I'd want to know why the guy paid for sex, who the woman was, how they interacted, and what he thought of the experience. If he chose to have unprotected sex, seemed to disrespect the woman (or sex workers in general), and was sexually/physically abusive, I wouldn't want to date him. If he treated it like any other service transaction and dealt with the service provider with dignity, I don't think there's anything wrong with it.   Are you thinking of getting a tatto kya - 'Paid for sex' :) "

Wonder how many of them on the map are fake. Aahh.. An urban-dweller's dream come true They are having an n-some That is some really shitty experience.

Even though you have a 100 cars, just keep a limit on how many cars you want to show on the app.

Expectation Setting : The road is literally filled with cabs. You will get one in like a minute or so. 
Result : Still get a cab that is 2 kms away or more than 10 mins away. Well that's just the weekly ola orgy being carried out in peace Bangalore is the only major city in the country where you can  park pretty much where you want.  I don't think I've ever seen cars being towed or asked to move off any road here.   Just curious, what is that place on the right where they have a shitload of cabs? I used to live in that neighbourhood 4 years ago. There were zero normal cabs. The times, they change! Why does it say Indra Nagar near Jakkur? Better than Uber I think, got an Alto 800 today in Uber. I'm 5'9"", my colleagues are 6'2"" and 6'. It felt like solitary confinement in there. [removed] And despite the shit load of cabs present, there is not a single TFS cab.

It's always the case, the 6 Rs/Km cab is a myth. that's what is called a cluster fuck I really, really, really like this image.  You're lucky that a cab is in your area. My area is quite away from the main city and most of the time there are no cabs in the area. One time I had to go to the station and I couldn't find one, Uber saved the day (but with 1.4x price surge). It could be entirely possible that most of them are on their way somewhere else and hence showing on the map?  The Ola Centipede Now I know why traffic is so bad in Bangalore.  Seen something like this on BTM last Saturday morning around 11 AM. It was still 1.5 times, waited for some more time it became 1.3. Then i saw TFS car and booked it immediately without any surge pricing. 

I use OLA a lot, have been to cars couple of times when driver said it is their first day in OLA.

She has two kids, recently met her in a supermarket. The girl I talked to not more a dozen times in our 12 years of studying together recognised me and talked to me. 

She lost her bubbly personality and have this calm and measured demeanour. I just wish she does well in her life. 

On a side note, I got a fb request from her today. 
 My mom and dad wanted me to be like neighbour's *beta!* or the first, second or third boy in the class.

134,Non-Political,[Non-Political][Serious]: What's your thoughts on GST now?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6izxwj/nonpoliticalserious_whats_your_thoughts_on_gst_now/,"1st of all; I'm not looking for political circle-jerking. I'm looking for neutral viewpoint and dispassionate analysis. I personally believe if you passionately hate or support something, you lose the objectivity.

I think it's a step in right direction. However, there is a lot of scope for improvement. I have couple of points to add. Please correct me if I’m wrong and share your valuable insights. Also, comprehensive study articles/papers is most welcome.


* For starters, the rates are quite confusing. and I spoke with a CA guy, he thinks there are a lot confusion as of now. So I think we can say it's in beta phase. After the implementation, govt would need to sort out various issues and make sure it increases the efficiency. Also, I think rates for various items have been decided in haste and randomly. So, that has to be addressed after the implementation.


* I think it doesn’t solve the central issue. Police at the state borders will make other excuses to stop trucks and demand bribes. One of my relatives is truck transporter. If the driver doesn’t pay the bribe, police simply break their headlights and then charge the fine. This is a lot common. In this respect, GST barely helps in faster movements of goods. Since petroleum and Alcohol has been kept out of GST, police can stop trucks to check these items.

* It’s far from one tax one nation. The proposed tax structure includes a Central GST, a State GST and an Interstate GST. “Given the current structure, if a person does business in three States, he has to get six registrations and make a number of regulatory filings.

* The Central GST Bill allows the central government to set up an anti-profiteering authority by law, or designate an existing authority to carry out the functions.  The authority will be responsible for ensuring that the reduction of tax rates on account of implementation of GST results in a commensurate reduction in prices.  India has had bad experience with new monitoring bodies. I am afraid this will simply turn another method of officials to strong-hand the honest business and extort money if there is no proper oversight on anti-profiteering body. CVC in railway was established to catch corrupt officials. It is yet to catch a single official and we know how much corruption is there. This will lead to more govt; more govt means more corruption and inefficiency.

* I think it will take atleast 2-3 years to have clarity on rates and various legal issues. Till then, there would be chaos and inflation will generally increase. After that, if govt make right iterations, we might see the benefit of GST.

* Lastly, In India reforms generally work in different way. Govt takes 3 steps ahead and after much brouhaha it takes the two steps back. So, you are left with only one step in right direction which is better than zero steps ahead.
"," I actually welcome the One Nation; One Tax system. But with GST, this primary objective is defeated when we have multiple tax rates. But there is hope the rates will be made homogeneous over a period of time.

GST is taunted  as a measure to reduce the paper work and complexity of businesses. But the government failed to address where WE the consumers are in the equation. It was advocated that the less procedures and simplicity in tax returns would increase the efficiency and would result in reduction of cost which will ultimately benefit the consumers.
However, with the raise of key services like banking, insurance, etc from the existing 15% service tax to 18% GST, the consumer interest takes back seat. For service industry I believe they should have atleast kept in a similar rates since there is no visible benefit when you are going to higher tax for the same shitty services.

The governments preparedness with systems is questionable since there were reports that the implementation dates should be postponed due to this. But the government is firm on implementing from July 1st, as with demonetization they are not bothered with the consequences. But this will ultimately affect the businesses and result in lower growth.

As you mentioned, registration with multiple states and filing returns would defeat the primary purpose of GST. Also for inter-state transactions, the government advised the business to continue using the existing forms, so the state border checkposts will remain.

Yes in longer run probably 3 - 5 years the system will mature and we may even have one single rate for all commodities in the future.

  To tell you the truth OP I still don't understand what the GST does . I mean I get the gist of it like all indirect taxes will be abolished , different tax rates by different states will now be the same but other than it I still don't know what it is going to do I think a lot of us cheered its passage, but in hindsight, I really think the BJP should have waited until securing its own majority in the Rajya Sabha instead. As you, OP, point out, they ended up having to make too many mini concessions to get everyone on board, and the effect was just replacing 28 different complicated, bureaucratic AF tax systems to one big one. 

But it's a step in the right direction. In hindsight a lot of Modi bhakts (myself included) naively supposed this was going to be a quick shot, overnight process - I think successive governments will keep tweaking it. Hopefully. Why would inflation rise? [deleted]"

It has always been an indoor cat, and is shit scared of the outside world and everything beyond the main door. The neighbours say it escaped out of the blue. They tried searching but in vain. How do I get my cat back?
Update :D"," You could probably keep its kitty litter outside and hope it comes back. Put flyers outside may be. I grew up with a cat who lived for 25 years, and have also had neighbors who have had, and have cats. So I'm assuming I know a thing or two about cats.

Firstly you cat give zero fucks about your neighbor and might have wanted to GTFO from their home as soon as you left it there. You basically put it outside it's comfort zone. So kitteh dear would not want to be there. Cats are also hunters, so kitteh might be hunting and roaming the neighborhood for a few days.

The key here is that you need to be back home, and kitteh needs to know that it's slave (yeah cats own you) us back and it's territory is no more blocked.

I wish you luck. And all I can say is that your meow will be back. Also depends where you stay. If it is some busy tier 1 city, your meow might be a kabab right now. Don't leave your pussy with neighbors man !  If it's a male cat, they are notoriously difficult to keep them at home once they reach puberty. He is gonna be out trying to score some pussy. If you are lucky he may come back 3 to 4 days later depending on how successful he is at getting laid. I have a Tomcat and you can't keep that fucker at home for more than 2 days and I live in a fucking 21 floor tower. He leaves the home on his home and comes back home after 2 to 3 days on his own.  keep some milk near the window Your post does not have any flair and will soon be removed if it remains so.

What kind of event is this ?

Can you please elaborate  After reading few questions, I was thinking of doing an AMA. Will you be interested in knowing about Japan and Japanese culture?

144,Non-Political,"[Text] [Non Political] I was on verge of quitting my business after four years, I wrote this to myself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4zkbjx/text_non_political_i_was_on_verge_of_quitting_my/,"Waldo Emerson once said that bad times have scientific values, and I can’t recall who quoted that no matter how bad it is, it can always be worse. These are some uninspiring thoughts when we have poured in years of work to learn, unlearn, build, dismantle, and assemble again. 

Some jumping ship, some hanging around fighting for the cause; begging, borrowing, appropriating, somehow, you do everything to never let doubts creep into your mind. 

Some nights are spent, staring at a blank screen, unresponsive code, a sad prototype of the dream that you chase.

Some days are spent, evaluating yourself, if the sum total of your life was a failure that was staring you in the face each day, each night. Your self-worth becomes zero, you become completely undesirable to people who probably loved you once, you have already jerked off to all the porn that you could handle.

By this time, all your friends have become your creditors, with lines of credits exhausted, you scroll your contact list constantly to find that one person, not to seek funds, but to talk with.
We try to hark back for simpler times, reminiscence the moments that made us laugh, then, but we hope probably it would bring an honest smile to our face – our smiles that we had pawned off we did not know when, to users, downloads, sessions and GMVs.

Then one day, you come home, stare at the blank screen, try to make sense of things, break down, and just before letting go of everything seems like an option. You think of Ali, you think of Lincoln, you seek wisdom in the hymns of Nanak, and sagacity and enlightenment from Bhagvad Gita; but you know who comes to your rescue, Earnest Hemingway.

*You are not made for defeat, you can be destroyed, but not defeated.*

To further (mis)quote Hemingway, sometimes our actions are not immediately discernible and when we try for something beyond attainment, something that has never been done, and things that others have tried and failed, and perhaps with ‘karma’ you will succeed.

I guess Andy Dufresne was right, it does come down to a simple choice really. Get busy living or get busy dying."," OP, do not continue your business because you buy into what I call as ""success porn"" where one is constantly bombarded with motivational quotes and stories of entrepreneurs rescuing businesses from the brink of their death.

Take a calm, logical look at your situation separating emotion from the process completely. If you were just handed this business today, what would you do? Sometimes shutting down your business is the right thing to do.  Upvoting for visibility in the hope some experienced hand pours some wisdom. Business is harrrd! 

And for most times, once you're in, there really is no easy exit. 

I have no advice for you, but I congratulate you for the 2 or 3 houses (staff) you feed and wish you all the best.   if money is the only problem, in all seriousness i am eager to hear.
The biggest problem is finding people like you who have the will / desire to succeed and money becomes the problem.
PM me if you would be open to a discussion and if i am getting it right. Many Thanks for sharing this, OP. It was deep. 

*""You are not made for defeat, you can be destroyed, but not defeated.""*

I have always been motivated by below shabad for Guru Gobind Singh: I am sure, you would have heard of it. 

""ਦੇਹ ਸਿਵਾ ਬਰੁ ਮੋਹਿ ਇਹੈ ਸੁਭ ਕਰਮਨ ਤੇ ਕਬਹੂੰ ਨ ਟਰੋਂ ॥ ਨ ਡਰੋਂ ਅਰਿ ਸੋ ਜਬ ਜਾਇ ਲਰੋਂ ਨਿਸਚੈ ਕਰਿ ਅਪੁਨੀ ਜੀਤ ਕਰੋਂ ॥ ਅਰੁ ਸਿਖ ਹੋਂ ਆਪਨੇ ਹੀ ਮਨ ਕੌ ਇਹ ਲਾਲਚ ਹਉ ਗੁਨ ਤਉ ਉਚਰੋਂ ॥ ਜਬ ਆਵ ਕੀ ਅਉਧ ਨਿਦਾਨ ਬਨੈ ਅਤਿ ਹੀ ਰਨ ਮੈ ਤਬ ਜੂਝ ਮਰੋਂ ॥੨੩੧॥ [1]

If you can't read Punjabi: 

""Deh siva bar mohe eh-hey subh karman te kabhu na taro. Na daro arr seo jab jaye laro nischey kar apni jeet karo. Arr Sikh ho apne he mann ko, eh laalach hou gun tau ucharo. Jab aav ki audh nidan bane att he rann me tabh joojh maro.""



Good luck dude, wish you lots of prosperity.  Cool writeup OP. I am in the same boat so can empathize. Some of the things that seem to work for me:

1. Dont spend too much time on social media - comparing your life with someone else's on facebook is going to make you feel a lot worse. Everyone is fighting their own battle. Your battle might be harder, but you are also built stronger, so its only fair.

2. Do something to tune out completely for say a week/10 days every 3 months. When I say tune out, you should be extremely engaged in something completely unrelated - like music or some sport or some travel. Thinking about the same business ALL the time structures your thoughts in a certain way. Breaking this pattern by doing something unrelated and then coming back to look at the business has given me some amazing insights. 

3. Sometimes business hits a wall. Consider letting it go for sometime like a few months. Dont decide on anything but just focus on something else - it could be another idea, or could be a small job, or some remote work. Sometimes the only thing a business needs is time for it to reveal itself. 

4. Consider psychotherapy. In India this is kinda looked down upon, but this one thing can dramatically improve your self being. Having someone to open up to completely helps you evaluate your thoughts better and helps you make sense of what you are doing. The awesome thing about India is that psychologists are ridiculously cheap - you can get someone with shitload of phds to hear you out for a pittance. 

5. Try reading about stoicism. That one thing has dramatically changed my perspective on life and has been the single biggest source of happiness for me. 


 Great advice all around! I am going through a phase where I am penning down all my thoughts for a startup. I will use this perspective and advice to prepare myself and my family for the hardships. Good luck!  and where are you now?

curious... Well as long as we're furiously name dropping and quoting people...

>Everybody knows by now, all businessmen are completely full of shit; just the worst kind of low-life, criminal, cocksuckers you could ever wanna' run into - a fuckin' piece of shit businessman. And the proof of it, the proof of it is, they don't even trust each other. They don't trust one another. When a business man sits down to negotiate a deal, the first thing he does is to automatically assume that the other guy is a complete lying prick who's trying to fuck him outta his money. So he's gotta do everything he can to fuck the other guy a little bit faster and a little bit harder. And he's gotta do it with a big smile on his face. You know that big, bullshit businessman smile? 

> ~George Carlin  


So tread carefully OP. A warrior always proceeds with life strategically, not with some misplaced romantic fervor.  Nice read. Thanks OP.

She will guide you to places where you can actually take them; or atleast divert you to people in Mumbai who do such a thing. 

Alternative call up People for Animals or Blue Cross if they have chapters in Mumbai.

PS: How old are they? Can you atleast post a picture of it? Or send them as a message to me>? That would really really help me greatly!! I am facing the exact the same problem in my colony ( In Delhi).....There were initially 4 puppies but two of them died....We looked after them collectivelly but no one really took responsibility....It's sad but the two are big enough now to surive on their own....still their are so many new puppies every year and there is no solution but sterilization.  Don't feed them normal milk. They cannot process lactose. I killed a baby squirrel by mistake that way. Find lactose free milk like lactaid. The same milk that newborn human babies drink.

Edit: As pointed out, lactose has nothing to do with it. I take it back. Most infants including puppies however have difficulty processing cow's milk and will develop diarrhoea.  upvoting for visibility

148,Non-Political,India's first lesbian ad. [Non political],https://youtu.be/Ef27m5ocK6Q,," Fuck them, still not installing their stupid app. Its a pain to browse stuff it that and it takes an unusually long time to load.  What is this supposed to be an advertisement for? What is so special about anouk that makes it especially suited for this or any couple?

A Zomato lesbian ad could have been much better.

""It's your turn to cook today""

""But I cooked yesterday!""

""Fuck it, let's just eat out.""

Cue *Bow chicka bow wow* Nope, still not downloading the Myntra app If they r lesbians, which one gets dowry? This isn't an ad.. this is a short movie.  This is absolutely disgusting. What the fuck is happening to our culture? How can we allow this? Why the fuck is she is marrying a north Indian? 

Edit: Holy shit, my fourth gold in the last two months! Thank you /u/robojunkie for this gilding Kudos! Although I guess the first one was by fastrack : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmk9D53G6F8 Couldn't take this shit. The Tamil was horrendous.  The kurthas were *meh*.. Good thing Myntra does not have a offline store 😜  Seriously impressed!

Would love to see this and other ads like this air on national television. When more and more kids start seeing these things on TV, the more ""normal"" it becomes for them. What is this ~~ad~~ short movie about? It just shows two people in a relationship where one person is waiting for her parents to show up. I felt that the advt. was more focused on showing the relationship than the kurta! Ads can be lesbian too. TIL. Plot twist. The girl in blue is actually dying of cancer and is breaking the news to her parents.  Good job. LGBT rights are an important contemporary issue and there is an urgent need for a public conversation in this regard. Sensitizing the public about different sexualities is a very welcome initiative. 

That said, corporate appropriation of a social cause is ALWAYS meant for profiteering, and any positive effect is merely incidental, not at all a stated aim. **A good example is how the Tobacco companies targetted women by making cigarettes a symbol women's liberation**.

Who ate Chow mein amongst them? As a South Indian, I am impressed that recent movies / ads are casting super hot girls as South Indians.

Sell your products right, without increasing price and adding discount later. Does that require being bold? I dont think so. Uh why are most comments talking about the Myntra app?

Fix the bloody Indian dota 2 servers. Its fucking unplayable. 22 year old me, with my best friend(know her since a long time), head to a bar with other friends. Get high. Dunno how we started kissing when others went to loo or what ever. Kissed twice. I regularly visit that place. First kiss at 17 in coaching class with fwb.  Cheeks or lips? Never happened ;_; [deleted] Waiting for one.  End of 11th grade. Made out in an empty classroom for over twenty minutes. Best kiss ever Anyone watching Barca Bayern match tonight? Holy fuck kxip got analed. My first kiss would be when I was 19 - yeah pretty late but pretty much made up for that. I have a date - actually a drinking date - with a Polish girl this week. First time it was supposed to happen ->

Met my GF for the second time at a restaurant. We were warming up to each other when a text came to my cell and she read it. It was from my ""back-up"" long distance GF. Long story short, kissy toh huwa nahi, break up ho gaya. :(

First time it happened ->

Fast forward two years. Same girl. Same city. Different restaurant. We sat at the corner table, hidden from rest of the restaurant. She goes ""Jaldi se kissy karlo. Koi aa jayega"". :P I cupped her face and kissed. :) See Abhijeet defending Salman on Twitter. ek number ka chutiya insaan

I'm awkward with guys more than girls lel. I don't talk to a lot of people though. Plz to Advice : 

Why is it necessary for guys (specially me) to keep on initiating the conversations. When i am just looking at being friends. Why do girls do that? If you arent believing in having friendship with a  guy say me, the fuck do you be a chatterbox once i initiate the conversation.

Experience holders and girls plz to advice . Honestly i am not hitting on them then also they do it like this. Kya hai bhenchod 

I hate it when people throw their fits over me, and then fucking turn off your cellphones and disappear. This just because they assumed something about me? And didn't listen to me?

154,Non-Political,I think we should come up with a way to make journalists of India accountable. Any ideas folks? [non-political],https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/339yw8/i_think_we_should_come_up_with_a_way_to_make/,," Yes, start a website that categorizes the media by organization, and reports the following:

* Factual errors in stories (so ToI would be at the bottom of the credibility charts here)
* Story coverage percentage (i.e. how much celebrity culture nonsense was covered, v/s real news)
* Undisclosed political affiliations/relationships
* Difficult, but most important - undisclosed *monetary* relationships
* (hat tip u/HighInterest: Read and support with your money serious, long-form magazines like [Caravan](http://www.caravanmagazine.in/) that actually have balanced, well-researched journalism) IMO opinion a movement for #PressNeutrality or shall we say #PressObjectivity is far more important than #NetNeutrality. 

/r/india will you do that ? sue the liars There's this Google Chrome extension called 'Churnalism' which lets you see how much of the article you are reading is blatantly plagiarized from another article. I think apps similar to this can help readers sort through garbage media and good media.

Also, I would suggest reading more articles from magazines like Swarajya or Caravan. Yes, both have their biases, but they're not all out pressitutes to get many pageviews. Their writing and research is usually spot on. Law about reporting factual information.  Journalists are already accountable to the viewership which is directly tied to their monetary incentives.

You have two choices - educate people to not pay them through their viewing OR start your own channel, both of which are not feasible. So some people resorted to the internet. So now, you gotta bring the viewers to the internet tv by making an online crowd-sourced news channel. Hard but doable.

Now, I am a computer scientist and working on cryptocurrencies. I have an idea(in the form of an algorithm so no bakchodi, its a serious idea) which if implemented can 'force' the journalist into accountability by only showing what they actually observe. If they show paid content then they loose money. Sharing this idea would involve explaining many things including cryptocurrencies which I currently don't have the time to. I am working on this idea though. If you understand the 'blockchain' protocol and can answer 'why blockchain is the 8th layer of the OSI model' then post and I shall tell you how we can do it.
 something on these lines

http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/ But how does one get all this across the people - These people's Opinions not reporting? Which is the best way of dissemination ? Come on some body give an idea. I, for instance , post on my FB and any other site in FB that has a large audience. WE should show the presstitudes that their pen which spreads falsity is not mightier than the sword of truth.


Edit:  Who is down voting me? The presstitude brigade? Lets launch presstitutes.com. And name the so called journalists, who are really just presstitutes. We will invite the honoralble Gen VK Singh to inaugurate the site.  I've been thinking of this for a very long time - a site with profiles of journalists along with a 'bias meter' This [dude](http://www.mediacrooks.com/) does a reasonable job, although that does not make any of them accountable. newslaundry does this right? I always felt there should be a law which says

- If your sensational new turned out to be false

    - TV, should run a program apologizing for the same (same time at which the original program was run and for the same amount of time)
    - Newspaper should publish in the same space on the same day. If it is a headline, newspaper publishes apology in headline.

  I know - wishful thinking.. sigh.. We should create an Ombudsman consisting of Retd. Judges, IAS officers and other old Journos and create & enforce something similar to these http://handbook.reuters.com/index.php?title=Main_Page

 I'd like to ask him what he thinks about earning easy money by being edgy and catering to his audience that likes edgy humour. 

Not that there's anything wrong with edgy humour, as long as it doesn't cause injury, but I really am curious as to whether he gets a sense of fulfilment knowing that he's chosen such a cheap way to earn money. Not that there's anything wrong with that either, but I just don't see how one can get fulfilment from that. Wouldn't it get repetitive and soul-draining after a while?  He will ask for money. Cash and to be paid upfront before the AMA.  Please No.That attention whore might actually do it. Give a kick on his butt

On 30 March, its editor-in-chief Ruben Banerjee put out a public note, stating: “We are announcing a temporary suspension of the print edition of Outlook magazine with immediate effect.”

- Meanwhile, The Indian Express has asked employees to take pay cuts. On 1 April, in an email to employees, CEO George Varghese wrote: “Vendors are insecure, RWAs (Resident Welfare Association) are insecure, the rail, road and air lockdown has grounded distribution, businesses are shut down, we have been compelled to reduce print orders in all centres.”

- On 10 April, Hindi News channel News Nation fired its entire English digital team of 15 journalists, despite the Narendra Modi government’s advisory urging public and private companies to not cut salaries or fire people during the lockdown.

- The Times of India has also allegedly sacked its entire Sunday magazine team. In a Facebook post, journalist Nona Walia claimed: “The entire team of Sunday magazine of Times of India asked to leave. Got a call from my boss Poonam Singh. Sacked after 24 years from a company I served with love for more than two decades. Wow.”

- Moreover, about half the employees working at The Quint, a digital media website, have been sent on leave without pay. A newsroom note accessed by ThePrint stated: “We are forced to request you to proceed on a ‘furlough’ (ie, leave without pay, LWP) wef the 15th of April, until further notice. Your pay for the half-month, from April 1 through 15, shall be processed and released very soon.”

- Hindustan Times Marathi will also allegedly close its operations from 30 April. However, this hasn’t been confirmed so far.

181,Coronavirus,Modi’s India Isn’t Prepared for the Coronavirus,https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/04/10/modis-india-isnt-prepared-for-the-coronavirus/,," Published 3 days back. Reposting in light of speech from PM.


>The largest lockdown in history arrived with a four-hour notice. At 8 p.m. on March 24, Narendra Modi, the prime minister of India, appeared on television for the second time in a week to announce that starting at midnight the entire country was going to be effectively curfewed to slow the spread of COVID-19. A land as populous and tightly peopled as India can become a feast for a disease that thrives on human proximity. Modi’s decision was necessitated by mounting casualties in countries with health care vastly superior to India’s and proliferating warnings of impending calamity by experts at home.



>His decisiveness appears to have yielded some success: As of April 10, there were 6,039 active cases of COVID-19 and 206 fatalities. (Although since there is no mass testing—fewer than 43,000 samples were tested by the end of March—and because the symptoms of the disease are not often apparent, there may be many more unreported cases.) This success, however, is braided together with a great deal of misery that could, with some preparation, have been mitigated—if not averted altogether. The sudden exodus of millions of Indians eking out an existence in the cities to distant villages across India bespeaks the malign incompetence of a prime minister who, despite being in command of enormous resources, squandered crucial weeks.

>Consider the sequence of events. The first COVID-19 case in India was reported on Jan. 30. Yet as late as March 13—two days after the World Health Organization had declared the outbreak a pandemic—a senior official in the health ministry was assuring Indians that coronavirus is not a health emergency. India was one of the first countries to ban flights and bar travelers from China. But the appearance of alertness concealed inertia: It wasn’t until March 19 that the government ordered a halt on most exports of lifesaving equipment. An inventory of what was available, made public three days later, revealed the extent of the government’s negligence in the crucial weeks when the global march of the virus had become unstoppable. There were only 40,000 respiratory systems in a country of more than 1.3 billion people, one isolation bed for every 84,000 people, one doctor for every 11,600 patients, and one hospital bed for every 1,826 Indians.

>Modi’s response was mystifyingly relaxed even as the perils of delaying action were becoming apparent in the tragic experiences of other countries. In the last week of February, he hosted a state visit for U.S. President Donald Trump. Its wasteful extravagance was worthy of the Kims of North Korea: Dozens of families living in shanties were served eviction notices and a wall was hastily erected to conceal them from presidential view. In March, Modi devoted his energies to toppling the government of Madhya Pradesh, the central Indian state governed by the opposition Indian National Congress party. Because the prime minister does not take questions from the press—he has not held a single real press conference in his six years as prime minister—it is impossible for those outside his impenetrable circle of confidants to ascertain his thinking. When it was announced finally that Modi was going to address the nation at 8 p.m. on March 19, panic swept through a country that was still recovering from the prime minister’s previous big 8 p.m. speech—in 2016—when he abolished 86 percent of all currency notes in circulation, plunging the country into chaos and precipitating the worst unemployment crisis in decades.

>This time, however, Modi was soberer. He asked Indians to observe a “people’s curfew” during the day on Sunday, March 22, and applaud those working in front-line services—doctors, nurses, security personnel—in the evening. Most Indians obeyed his request and remained indoors. In the evening, however, many poured into the streets to celebrate. There were fireworks and festivities in some cities. Celebrities with large fan bases applauded Modi’s “masterstroke” and spread the myth that the virus was going to be vaporized by the “reverberations” of mass clapping. In 2014, the year Modi first entered office, India had placed a satellite in Mars’ orbit. The existence now of a market for the risibly anti-scientific piffle peddled by Modi’s admirers speaks to the depressing intellectual decline of the country. The curfew culminated in a farce. Still, given the unprecedented nature of the crisis, it was possible to give the benefit of the doubt to Modi: He was perhaps taking stock, buying time, and utilizing that time to mobilise India.

>It was only after Modi announced a nationwide lockdown on the evening of March 24 that it began to dawn upon Indians that there was no plan. Modi was repeating what he had done in 2016. He was improvising, gambling, performing the French art of on s’engage, et puis on voit: first engage, then figure things out. Modi told Indians on March 19 that he had already created a special task force to mitigate the economic distress that the coronavirus would invariably provoke. He had done no such thing: Among those who had not heard of the task force’s existence until that moment was India’s finance minister—the person who, according to Modi, was supposedly chairing it. The first budgetary allocation for all of India’s emergency health care needs—$2 billion, or roughly $1.50 for every Indian—was also announced on March 24, 54 days after the first case was detected in the country. The first orders for the production of personal protective equipment for front-line health care workers were made hours before the announcement of the lockdown. The economic stimulus and relief package promised by Modi did not arrive for another two days. And when it did, it was the paltriest of all the big economies in the world: $22.6 billion—less than 1 percent of India’s gross domestic product—more or less the same amount earmarked by Modi to remodel the capitol in New Delhi. Rather than scrap this vanity project, the prime minister who spent more than $640 million in taxpayer money on publicity in his first term in office cleared it days before the lockdown.

>What passed for the emergency aid package was for the most part a rescheduling of preexisting cash and food grant arrangements to poorer citizens. The union government in New Delhi will pay only a small share of the expense; much of the money will come from state governments. Left out altogether from its purview are the estimated 45 million migrant workers: the men and women who serve the needs of first-world India’s inhabitants as chauffeurs, servants, cleaners, cooks, and construction hands. This oversight may have been the result of carelessness rather than callousness. But that distinction means nothing to the millions of Indians who find themselves abandoned by the state and left to starve. All of India’s entrenched inequities—of caste, of wealth, of religion—have been on vivid display since the lockdown was announced. The chief justice of India, petitioned by activists urging him to direct the government to pay the wages of stranded migrants, wondered why they needed wages when they were being fed. The lack of thought has led to chaos and severe shortages. Trucks have piled up on the roads. Even the supply chain of medicines has been disrupted.

>Contrast the feeble planning that preceded the enforced isolation of 1.3 billion people with the attention that went into burnishing the cult of Modi once the lockdown came into effect. Even though a disaster relief scheme to collect donations from the public has existed for decades, the prime minister created an opaque new charitable trust—christened the Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations Fund to create the abbreviation “PM-CARES”—on March 28 and began soliciting contributions for it. Emergency supplies have been glazed with Modi’s face. And the prime minister’s office proceeded to produce a series of slick short films in dozens of languages—including Italian, Russian, and Mandarin—in which a slim, animated avatar of Modi is shown performing yogic calisthenics. Staff at foreign embassies in New Delhi have been invited to relieve stress by doing “Yoga with Modi.” This isn’t the first time Modi has deployed crude propaganda in a moment of mass panic. In 2013, when he was the chief minister of Gujarat, his office publicized the “rescue and relief operation” supervised personally by Modi to evacuate 15,000 pilgrims stranded in the foothills of the Himalayas. The Times of India eulogized Modi as India’s “Rambo” and praised his “trademark style of micro-management.” The entire story was a fabrication.

>The coronavirus has struck India at a time when social cohesion is at its weakest in decades. The reservoirs of inner strength societies draw from in times of crisis were depleted in India on surviving the crises engineered gratuitously by Modi over the past six years. India’s minorities, especially its Muslim community, have every reason to look askance at a sectarian establishment that has sought to portray them as a fifth column and pushed legislation they fear could render them stateless. The civic conditions necessary to mount a public-spirited campaign have been shredded by the exclusionary policies pursued by Modi’s Hindu-first Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)."

Its a partnership  between government and Akshaya patra. 

They operate mega kitches and participate in mid day meal scheme so government approached them to extend the same for urban poor. 

Akshaya Patra has capacity and govt provided the platform , i.e Annapurna Canteens.  

It will cost 23 rupees to serve a  meal .

Govt will pay 18 rupeees per person and  5 will be charged from the person.

Such a beautiful example of  govt and NGOs coming together for betterment of community.  

But , india today guys are telling govt did nothing,  despite reimbursing almost all the cost  for ever meal they serve and comning up with an initiative . NGOs and charities exists for this reason, to help the private sector contribute and plug the gaps that the government cannot. I know for a fact that the maharashtra cm's office reached out to some individuals they know are involved in a lot of charity, to ask them to source food quickly, and at reasonable prices, and also told them of organizations who'd need support.

But one of my closest friends is stuck in Delhi (Kalkaji, South Delhi). He was returning from Ranchi to his home in Noida after giving an interview there. Unfortunately, when he returned to Delhi, the same day, all cabs/metro/buses stopped working due to strict lockdown measures. And UP border as well as Delhi was sealed. Consequently, he could not reach Noida and had to settle for getting a PG room somehow but was still living in scarcity of food etc .He tried asking for police help from both Delhi and UP police, but no help. Now, the accommodation manager has increased per day rent to around  Rs. 1200/night. And with coming summer and further scarcity of food, etc., it is becoming increasingly tough for him to manage. All his savings are nearly finished. I tried to help whatever little I could financially. And hoped that lockdown would end on April 14 and he might move back to his home. But now with lockdown further extended, chances of his survival are getting really slim. Plus, there looks no definite end to lockdown to be hopeful.

I will be extremely indebted if any of you might help at the moment. If someone has a room available in a house and can keep him for a few days, that would be seriously life saver. He can still pay something for the room, but hopefully he will get to use the kitchen or something, so that at least he gets meals once a day. 

As I said, I know it's super awkward to ask for this kind of help at the moment and probably we won't get any. But I am trying with all my luck if some miraculous solution emerge. If it helps, he was already screened for Covid at Delhi airport and was tested negative. Also, he has been mostly living alone for the past few weeks and do not have any symptoms. If someone can help, please send me a DM."," If someone was managing ~ 1000*18 = 18000 Rs for accommodation then noway he is poor , also airport screening is only for fever .. no real test . Ask him to contact proper authorities for cheaper / free accommodation + food .

There are many more poor / poorest people stuck in current scenario and they are managing somehow ... ask help from authorities not on Reddit . I am currently in NCR, Yesterday, The authorities in UP have asked general public to contact for any movement required , in order to reach their hometown.  Please ask him to get in touch with the local administration, have him explain his situation. Upvote for visibility. Help a brother out /r/india Since many areas are here sealed in delhi can you mention the area where he is currently staying. Also please ask him to wait till 14 maybe the border situation relaxes(maybe)."

The cluster there is from an IAS officer child who hid his travel history and his mom(who was later tested positive) went around attending the meetings and she passed it off to other officials.

226,Coronavirus,India's lockdown had near 0 effect on the spread of coronavirus in the country,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fzs4jb/indias_lockdown_had_near_0_effect_on_the_spread/,"See the total cases on log scale here:
https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/india/

it's a perfectly straight line since 7th March. Lockdown was enforced around 23rd March, and we should have seen a decline in slope a few days later if the lockdown had any significant effect in reducing the spread.

I know common logic says that lockdown is helping, but why doesn't the data say so?

One common argument i expect:
Slope would've increased if the lockdown wasn't in place
- this is not true. You can check data for countries without lockdowns and data for india between 7th March to 23rd March, straight line on the log plot is the natural expected graph for the exponential spread of the virus."," I don't think anyone would have supported a no-lockdown scenario when this virus started rearing its head in March; people were panicking for sure. It is now impossible to say in hindsight what would have happened if the lockdown wasn't enforced. The safer option at the time was the lockdown I think. &#x200B;

1. You need to allow more time for results. The incubation period goes up to 14 days. So someone who caught it on the 23rd might only be recorded as a new case on 7th April.
2. Total confirmed cases is a terrible statistic to track the growth of the virus. It's good for tracking the effects, a country with 100k cases will be 10x worse effected than a country with 10k cases. Because it spent 10x the resources to deal with those cases. But for virus growth, look at new daily cases. This the curve that we want to flatten. We want to reduce the number of people going to the hospital at the same time. Total number of cases is not the problem. A hospital can treat 100k cases given enough time, but not 10k cases in a weekend.
3. Logarithmic charts are meant to be compared to other logarithmic charts. Viewed on it's own, it won't make sense. Every logarithmic chart is a straight line. If it's not, then it doesn't make sense to plot along the logarithmic scale anymore. Compare our chart with some other country for a better idea of how our lockdown is doing. I would recommend comparing us vs US. The charts will still look similar, so pay attention to the scales. I was watching news yesterday and argument anchor had that we would have seen around 8.5 lac cases without lockdown. And I was like ab tak to utne total test bhi nahi huye hai😅 2 things:
1. This virus spreads quickly
2. The population of India

If the lockdown wasn't enforced, the total number of cases would be 100x more"

I'm no fan of this man but I don't think he was at any corner at all! His govt and its supporter never acknowledged any economic distress, they used Anti-CAA protests to further strengthen their ideological stance.

In fact, I feel this crisis has made him vulnerable. Millions are stranded on the roads, the rural areas would be simmering with discontent. Not sure where the writer is coming from. Print writes 'odd' articles. I prefer straight to the point kind of thing, they toss narratives as if it's some soap opera or something. Shekhar Gupta too do this sometimes with his non-serious tone, which i don't like at all. The economic disaster is waiting for him after the epidemic is gone. But I'm pretty sure he'll convince the herd that economic problems are surely due to COVID-19. They were non-existent before that. > Anti-CAA protesters have dispersed, and economic problems can be blamed on Covid-19. Modi is too smart a politician to miss the opportunity in a crisis. Chaos is a ladder.

And no one understands this better than Modi. Thinking this from the beginning. Corona is savior for him. > imposing a lockdown without notice, demonetisation style

Umm, if everything is viewed the the lens of Modi, then yes.  But look at lockdowns in other countries -- they deliberately came without warning, likely to prevent excessive hoarding and scattering of people. In the US, where stay-at-home orders are in place, folks often woke up to being given less than 24 hours notice. The only thing Modi gets from this crisis is an easy way out of the NRC fiasco if he wants to (Amit Shah will disagree). I too think this is some crazy ass news..... India is losing $4 Billion Dollars per day (Income from Transportation, Tourism etc).... More the numbers of day in lock down, the more distress it is for the Indian Government Revenues.... 

Modi will be desperate to kick start the economy as soon as possible..... This Pandemic is destroying countries with a CONSERVATIVE ruled Govts like USA, India, Italy, Brazil, Russia etc.... I smell a damn rat here!"

-------------

>The majority of tests around the world use a technology called PCR, which detects pieces of the coronavirus in mucus samples.
-------------------
>there are a lot of things that impact whether or not the test actually picks up the virus,"" Priya Sampathkumar, an infectious diseases specialist at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, told AFP.

It depends on how much virus the person is shedding (through sneezing, coughing, and other bodily functions), how the test was collected and whether it was done appropriately by someone used to collecting these swabs, and then how long it sat in transport,"" she said.

>With 40 million people, ""even if only one percent of the population was tested, 20,000 false-negative results would be expected."" (USA)

Part of the problem lies in locating the virus as its area of highest concentration shifts within the body.

https://np.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fl0pdv/mark_cuban_says_bailed_out_companies_should_never/

The execs of the top US companies who have tonnes of money as it is , I'm not sure exactly, but messed up. Didn't save any money, kept reinvesting profits in their own stocks so that company value goes up and now are basically going through heavy losses and have put the jobs of citizens at risk plus they want the government to use taxpayer money to bail them out.

And from what I gather these companies will remain privatised and won't be nationalised.

There is an uproar within the US against this and a comment I really liked stated ""Why should the profits be privatised and losses be socialised"" 

Anyway, I want to know what the policies are like in India. If India has similar policies and private companies in India will go through the same thing?

What are the policies Indian government in similar situations? Is buying your own stock also legal in India? 

If someone could also explain the situation in US and in similar context the Indian economy and situation. That will be greatly appreciated.

These two are blamed for all of India's problems and people are stupid enough to believe it. 




Honestly, as a dalit I sometimes wish let them remove reservation. Then let them explain to masses how 1% Indians are getting 73% Indian wealth. Within decade there will be riots in streets and true people responsible for Indian poverty will be found out. Sizable dalit tribal population doesn't understand how system is rigged against them, they think reservation is making some difference. These guys can finally wake up. You have 22.5% reservation for 29% SC,ST in government jobs which are just 4% of total jobs. And people think this is useful or something. The main question we need to ask is where are the damn jobs ? I have said previously that Scheduled Castes and Tribes are next on the list after Muslims.

Looks like I was wrong. They're targeting everyone at the same time, just with a different approach. >The other problem is also the court’s selective affirmation of the state’s discretionary powers for providing reservations. When it comes to a decision not to provide reservations, the court feels the state has absolute discretion and need not collect data to justify this decision. But when the state wants to provide quotas, the court brings in the concept of equality and places several restrictions that dilute the discretionary power of the state. The 50% ceiling for quotas is an example of this restriction.


This alone is enough to show how the SUPREME COURT is disingenuous and biased as hell and their end goal isn't equality of any sorts. First they stopped making it compulsory for promotion in government jobs and now will give only lower level jobs to reservations.
Second they stopped compulsory arrest in SC/St act and will give pree arrest anticipatory bail to the accused.

This is the destruction of the act itself. 

Bc reservation is not the government spooge to give its a bloody constitutional right. Get that modi shah I wish the govt does try fucking around with the reservations. I truly pray that they somehow think that by making their stooges pass such judgements that they can alter the basic tenets of reservations and try curtailing it. It will be the end of this govt. Period. Come on BJP/RSS! Try messing with reservations. Please. You can do it!! Show us how tough you are. First Moslems , now SC/ST ; good job BJP judiciary /govt . Golly what is with this government? Talk to upper caste, and they believe BJP is shit and giving SC/ST everything. Talk to SC/ST, they say its upper caste party

Who the fuck voted for these mfs? I believe reservations  should be based on economic conditions and not on caste.
The reason is many sc's and st's have a high family income yet take advantage of reservation.
On the other hand there are many general candidates that have very low family income yet have no such advantage.

Reservations(if any) should be used to lift the distressed classes and not lift the already uplifted."

If you want to play this game then as per Ayurveda the best quality of sleep is when you will sleep 9-10 PM, 9 pm to 2 am is the best quality of sleep, Even if you sleep after 2 am to 12 noon, You won't get that quality of sleep or that satisfaction.

That's how our body's bio clock works, Our body works in sync with Nature, we keep on altering it. Try sleeping between 9 to 10 pm, Withing 2-3 weeks you will notice that your sleeping quantity (hours) will decrease by the sleep quality will increase or get better.

Keep your electronics aside 1 hour before your bedtime, Mediate for 15 minutes if you can, Your body will enter Theta state, from that you can easily slip into Delta i.e. Deep Sleep. Don't eat heavy meals at night moreover avoid eating after 7 pm if you can

256,Scheduled,Will India (and our highly questionable work culture) benefit from a 4 days working \ 3 days weekly off schedule?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/drbswn/will_india_and_our_highly_questionable_work/,"This experiment has been adopted intermittently in many parts of the world across many companies - recently it found huge success in Japan at Microsoft:

https://soranews24.com/2019/11/03/microsoft-japans-experiment-with-3-day-weekend-boosts-worker-productivity-by-40-percent/

I think it's a well known, well documented reality of our times that work balance life is highly trash in India.

Work environments are largely toxic too due to a culmination of many internal & external factors.

The commute eats into a substantial time of the day for most folks as well on top of this. 

Are there any organizations in India who have already implemented a 4 day week - or are such plans in the pipeline for companies?

What are your thoughts on such an initiative - does anyone reckon it will succeed here?"," The single biggest minus point about Indian society is the non-existence of clear communication and lack of transparency and accountability in dealing with things.  

Such being the case, the 4 hour workday won't work because that kind of productivity requires an enormous amount of clarity with the undestanding that the everyone involved is working hard to get the job done. Japan and India are two entirely different animals.

Japan has an ageing workforce. It also has a work environment that emphasises employees working long hours. The stress had in recent times resulted in multiple news reports of employees committing suicide which had prompted a national outcry and condemnation.

In addition to this, the work-nolife balance also resulted in men and women choosing to marry late or choosing to delay having children. This isn't good considering the already low population growth rate in the country. This has even led to the mechanisation of many low end jobs in Japan because they can't find enough people to work.

So a 4 day work week might work in a country like Japan which is carrying out iniatives in order to promote population growth. The 4 day work week has a high synergy with these objectives.

India meanwhile has a high population growth, high unemployment and a young workforce. The competition here has prompted firms to cut costs in order to maintain profit. This often means a smaller workforce, which still does the same amount of work by taking longer hours; but without any commiserate increase in remuneration. 

Even when an employee is burned out, the rat race in India is so bad that there is always an enormous pool of often unemployed/underemployed applicants who are ready to be hired at short notice for a lower pay. So the employers can simply choose to fire the burned out employees and hire new recruits to keep the assembly line at work.

Long story short: In Japan, employees are still a key human resource. In India, they are an expendable tool. Many times we have to work on weekends anyways. Can't think why that will change. And it won't matter if your clients work 5 days a week. Your opinion doesn't matter. [The decision has already been made](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/govt-avoids-fixing-minimum-wage-in-draft-rules-suggests-9-hour-working-day-11572758439316.html).

> The Indian government has suggested a nine-hour normal working day in its draft wage code rules, but has stayed away from fixing a [national minimum wage](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/why-minimum-wage-won-t-fix-india-s-woes-1565619815429.html). 

> 26 days of work in a month

Which basically means 6 days a week.

So yeah, go fuck yourself. The Government has already decided 6 days a week, 9 hours a day for everybody. Bhai middle managers won't let this happen. Mandated 5 day work week would be a start. Apart from MNCs and few central government offices, everyone else works on Saturdays. also what would be the secondary effects of this move - as participation in hobbies, skill growth, lower commute \ traffic congestion - shall all have largely stimulating advantages in the overall environment. 

I am fascinated by what the results of such an experiment will be if implemented on a controlled, small scale. I think India would better benefit from more Work-from-home options. For example, come to office twice a week and wfh other days, especially in congested cities like bangalore. Now even Saturday and Sunday leave is a problem. Either you have to work om weekends due to some emergency or they load you with so much work and such deadlines that you end up working on weekend. If we deny the manager will say even we went through this or we will be simply released as there will be 1000s ready to work on saturday and sunday. Talk about negative competition. population (s)explosion That's like taking 3 steps at a time. First jobs need to be 6-8 hours long 6 days a week. Generally people are given ""work from home"" even on Sundays. Not to mention people work till 8 when they were supposed to be home by 5 or 6pm.

LOL. I was recently ghosted by a startup for letting them know I wasn't comfortable with their 6 day a week schedule (Monday to Saturday, every single week). Read on if you're interested.  

________________

**Back story -**

I recently interviewed at a startup for a tech role (Data Scientist) and was going through the final so-called ""cultural fit"" interview. I have almost 3 years of experience in the field. I currently work at a startup that works Monday to Friday (40 hours a week).   

Just doing my due diligence, I asked the interviewer if they work on Saturdays. To my disappointment, he said they do. Now, this was my 5th interview round. Not once did they tell me about their Mon-Sat schedule. I only got to know because I asked. 

For some context, this startup is 4 years old, have their product out in the market and have close to 30 employees (their claim - I was never invited to their office and all interviews happened on the phone in the course of a single week).   

As soon as I heard of their 6 day work schedule, I was disappointed. I mean, coming from a startup background myself, I understand the kind of hard work people need to put in every once in a while. Working on Saturdays during emergencies and other critical events is perfectly fine, but every single week? Come on! 

Oh, and I also would get **no** equity for my work there.  

But working on weekends wasn't necessarily a deal breaker to me. I just wanted to put myself in their shoes and know *why*. 

I mentioned to the guy upfront that my current organisation works 5 days a week, and that my life is built around a Mon-Fri schedule so it will be difficult to adjust to a 6 day work week.    

The guy must have realised my disappointment (this was on the phone), and so he started talking about how much potential this company has for growth and how much I could grow with the company. 


Anyway, I wanted to ask them their rationale for working every Saturday the next time we spoke, and also to evaluate for myself whether sacrificing my social life and hobbies for a job was worth it. 

Coincidentally, this conversation happened on a Friday, I got a text message the next day (Saturday), saying ""Let's close this today"". I had a long week and I switched off for the next two days and I didn't respond until Monday. I apologised for the delay, saying that I took some time off for the weekend and was ready for a discussion.    

That was it. I never heard from them again. I never said no to working on Saturdays, but still they ghosted me. I guess they wanted someone who would be submissive and not question their wisdom. 

Which is a shame, because the product (from what they told me, seemed interesting) but some of my friends say this was good riddance. Part of the problem is that our labour regulations and enforcement is, mildly put, absolutely terrible. Looking at indian labour laws is a crash course in the necessity of updating laws to new circumstances and the need to discard old laws in an expeditious manner rather than just getting by on the courts desperately trying to make the woefully inadequate laws fit the needs of today.

Even in sectors with massive deficits of required workers (such as medicine and law), the actual worker holds little power since regulations are lax and there's no one powerful actually standing up for them. A doctor or lawyer, especially one that's just starting out, will universally work long hours at the cost of his health; not because he's easily replaced, but because his managers are, for the most part, so inept that it would be tragic if it weren't hilarious. The iron law of wages is evident here for most to see.

Now how this can be remedied is a task in and of itself. It starts right from said horribly convoluted and loophole riddled regulations to the rather asinine practices of promoting professionals to managerial positions based on their ability to do their original job (a good doctor or lawyer isn't a good manager or leader) and linking payments to said promotions (which forces said professionals to seek such positions for better remuneration).

And yes, there's more to it than that, but the short answer is that the problem is very much systemic. This is as much cultural (if not more so) than it is economic. And that wages do not reflect demand or skill (otherwise we'd be paying the people who clean gutters more than any corporate CEO or hedge fund manager), they reflect status and power. 4 days working !! What a joke for Indian owners. I can see some of my friends are working on Saturdays also. Also, some are happy with their alternative Saturday holidays. I am sure as The sun that India will never implement this type of formula. Even government will do, Private company owners they will never spend a minute to think about it. You talking about 4 days working last month I worked on 2nd October without getting extra pay !! It's not like I'm talking about small towns this scene is available in one of the Metro city in India and only officially declared heritage city of India :) Would never work with our work ethic. Already mondays and fridays half the day is gone in either reaching late after leave travels or leaving early for leave travel. I still know people working in 6 days week. Even I used to work 6 days few years back. Let's make a uniform 5-day work week first. Better to learn to walk before attempting to run. I don't think that would work out over here. We've got a pretty laid-back work culture as is. most of the work in India is about availability and not about capability , our work culture is a reflection of it ( in both public and private sectors ) , Being specific to IT companies we are mostly cost centres which do really little productive work hence the moment we go for a 3 day weekend thereby increasing cost , these jobs will be outsourced to a cheaper location. Also apart from the '**highly questionable work culture**' we also suffer from highly questionable work ethic , as employees some treat their job as time-pass activity  working as seat warmers. For these people a 3 day weekend is pointless.

3 day weekend boost productivity which is amazing for people involved in demanding profiles, for this strategy to work in India we will need to have jobs that involve R&D ,planning or designing  . The problem is this kind of work demands attention and critical thinking, something our newer generation is quite not trained due to being spoon fed in schools with meaningless grades and ignored by professors in higher studies . Hence the 2nd thing will be reform our education system which emphasises more on thinking and less on following. It will work only if the office remains open six or seven days a week and there are alternate workers for those days which others have off.

That will kill both the unemployment problem and improve worker productivity. Might work where creativity is given large portion of importance..

For labour , essential services like hospital , it wont work , as this will hamper production in case of industries , and routine work procedure in case of health care industry. Service-based IT companies have their heads up their clients' asses. Middle and onsite managers make unrealistic promises to clients and make their subordinates work like a dog.

Much of this behavior stems from keeping their bosses happy, which was prevalent even during previous generations. So, I really don't see this happening until the time companies choose to treat their employees with respect. Yes, but only if people stopped the casual chit-chat over chai breaks, numerous smoke breaks, discussing cricket/politics breaks, taking personal calls at work breaks, hour long lunches and so on. [deleted] [deleted] Will it benefit the people? Yes, Of course.  
Will it benefit the companies? In the long run, yes.

I'd like to bring on a few points here:

* Japan is a labour shortage economy, yet the country is so culturally driven that loyalty and long working hours is a norm. You will find a huge faction of the workforce working for their first company throughout their career.
* India on the other hand is a labour surplus, and that too at the number one spot. In short, if you don't want to work long hours, there are literally thousands who would.
* This was done by just one company, Microsoft, which isn't even Japanese. They just tried it as an experiment, and 'might' do it again in the future.
* In a report produced a few months back, Indians turned out to be the employees taking the least holidays in the world. Technically it was correct, but didn't mention the procedures, the unapprovals, the interrogation involved with leaves in India. With such an approach of the organisations towards employees where taking leaves is ""not caring about the well-being of the organisation"", there's little hope of 4 day work-week.

I am a Senior Manager- Human Resources in one of the top media companies, and no matter what the terminology is - Human Resource, Human Capital, Personnel, Talent, Pink Squirrels, HiPots - the companies (there are exceptions) know that unemployment rates are high and that they can choose to treat employees like robots with little to no consequences. I have worked in a 4 day shift model back in 2008 and 2009, we had to trade off weekends. My working days used to be tue, fri,sat,sun. First implement 5 days, 8 hrs/day properly. Forget everything else. Work from Home once a week NEEDS to be a thing right now. Work culture is bad? 

Are you fucking kidding me? We Indians are lazy and most of teenagers and college going students that I have seen are complete morons. Even the new job takers have no skill and no desire to sit and learn.

If you think this is 'bad work culture and hard' then you are simply WEAK. Learn to fight. There are people surviving with no resources and you can't even survive and thrive after getting an excess of monthly income?! Shame on you And lose all that sweet outsourcing $$?

No, thank you very much. I'd rather jobs stay here than go to our Asian rivals. Use some basic sense.

We are a growing country and need to constantly do so just to keep up with the population growth let alone generating enough GDP to life people out of poverty.

Now imagine the whole indian work force stops working for one whole day every week? Does not even bear thinking about.

Everyone wants a work free chillax life, not everything the heart wants is good

Made in heaven - Part 2 Guy has a chance to pull out, literally The problem here is not so much the woman and her family, as the ridiculously biased, anti-men laws in this country. 

Do you guys know that if a woman dies within 7 years of marriage, the investigation has to be done by a magistrate under [Section 304B of the IPC](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/653797/), and the presumption of guilt is on the husband by default? Which means - the man will be assumed guilty by default. All your wife has to do is make some cuts and bruises on herself and the courts assume she committed suicide because of dowry harassment, and will send you to jail for 7+ years.

Our law still operates in the 19th century mindset, according to which all women are angels, capable of no wrongdoing, and must be protected from the evil men in society who are out to get them. Oh, and they can never have any premarital or extramarital relationships - they all are virtuous virgins by default.

In this country if you are ever wronged by a woman, it is better to shut your mouth and take it quietly. If you look to the law for recourse, the law will smack you down, throw you in a dark dingy prison and probably champion the verdict as a victory for women's rights.

259,Scheduled,The Continuing Practice of Untouchability in India.,https://i.redd.it/91hssr5m29b41.jpg,," My state, Manipur might have perrenial conflicts but I am proud, there is no practice of untouchability. Jai Maharashtra I used to be so confused about untouchability when I was little. I used to hear how the untouchables were mistreated by almost everyone. I thought why don't they just riot or fight those people mistreating them, after all they can't touch the untouchables! Later someone told me you could still touch them with sticks and stones. Damn, I was so ignorant. I live in a semi Village locality in West Bengal,can confirm most of the household still practice untouchability. Mostly with the maids of their house. I would like to see the correlation with percentage of 12th standard educated students. It's probably very high.

There is a reason why politicians don't like a well educated populace. Stupid people are easily manipulated into forming tribes and fighting each other. I’m curious to know what in Kerala and Bengals history was different from the Hindi belt. I’m surprised Maharashtra is so radically different from surrounding states. You would think that the border regions would have some sort of gradient in attitudes... Come on Cow belt. Please change. We are in 21st century **SOURCE:**

>This article is based on nationally representative data of 42,152 households, surveyed in 2011–12, which, for the first time, asked direct questions on caste and the practice of untouchability.

In case the response was a “No,” it was followed by the second question: “Would there be a problem if someone who is a Scheduled Caste were to enter your kitchen or share utensils?,” again seeking a “Yes/No” response. Any household that responded in the affirmative to both or either of the two questions was regarded as practising untouchability.

Economically sound hai to reservation ki kya zaroorat
Padha Likha hai , reservation ki vajah se isko Kuch Nahi AATA Hoga
Kaam ekdum (insert lower caste name) Jaise

I still remember when we lived in UP ,the house maid found out that we are dalit ,she left the work next day and same day we were asked to vacate the house. When we vacated the house my dad told me the landlords cleaned the whole house with Ganges water. Word got out and my family was socially ostracized , suddenly friends stoped talking to me. teachers called me with casteist slurs.
It was a living nightmare we had to leave the city

Now I still have to lie about my caste everywhere I go ,they all act progressive but in reality they are the backward ones

The most hilarious thing is people are ready to drink cow urine but won't touch food made by an untouchable Kerala of 1800s and early 1900s were extremely casteist, probably one of the worst in the country even. I haven't heard of practices like [breast tax](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_Tax) happening anywhere else other than Kerala. It's amazing how much we progressed in the last 60-70 years. Still, caste is not going anywhere, even in Kerala. It has gone more covert though. What I've noticed is that, many people from outside Kerala starts to probe about one's caste openly the moment you meet them. I've never experienced such things while I lived in Kerala. Unsurprisingly, it correlates with high GDP per capita and better HDI. I'm from M.P. and sc caste and i have seen people making bad/weird faces when knowing my last name. And i have seen my classmates discriminating sc/st people on the basis of reservation (""iska kya hai ye to bina padhe likhe bhi reservation se pass ho jayega/jayegi) The south seems to be far better. Interesting fact: Majority of the Hindu immigrants/refugees who will benefit from CAA are Dalits from Bangladesh, now living in Assam and West Bengal. BJP is a bit [two-faced](https://thewire.in/caste/the-two-faces-of-hindutvas-dalit-agenda) when it comes to Dalits. My district in Assam has close to 0%,feels good. I guess it correlates with education,we have the highest/2nd highest literacy rate in the State. How do they get this data? I am not questioning the validity of data. But I don't think they went house 2 house asking if people practice untouchability. These are depressing statistics Wtf whats up with some parts of himachal and uttrakhand? Thought my states didnt had it this bad. Nice to see my home state doing good-ish here. Still 5% is 5% too much. Shit needs to stop. I am noticing a pattern when it comes to every major problem in India. Way to go --- dont forget your Northeast Indians --- they have put aside these old beliefs --- Hindi heartland could learn a thing or two.

One observation is the long-time communist run states like Kerala and W.Bengal and the emphasis on education --- most commendable for Kerala given what its historic caste structure and history of oppression has been, even W.Bengal with the oppressive Zamindari history.

Maharashtra is interesting --- there is a common Marathi identity greater than other identifiers, possibly also the higher penchant for industry and economics.

Just my 2 paise trying to understand how this can be explained. No more claiming of North is Progressive and South is Conservative!  
Being conservative is good if you are Progressive within. In the context of this study, how are ""households practising untouchability"" defined? I was trying to see what it was from the link to the IHDS-II data, but I'm not savvy enough to figure it out.

In any case, I'm pleasantly surprised that Maharashtra, Goa, Kerala, and quite a few places in the North-East (except for the ones with no data) appear to have massively reduced the practice of untouchability in their regions. My state WB seem to do pretty well . If the data is right and good sample size is considered I'm aure it'll be even better. Maharashtra Kerala and Bengal along with the far Eastern frontier states seems considerably exceptional. Pretty predictable. But did no Jyotiba Phule or Rammohan Roy or Vidyasagar emerge in these northern states? I mean, damn look at the amount of red... pretty depressing for India as a whole...

Really informative and insightful. Again, not surprising that the places also map out with [where the BJP won](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Indian_general_election#/media/File%3AIndian_General_Election_2019.svg). South India is far more progressive, clearly. I love how the colour for 0% and no data is the same.   
TN's scenario isn't as bad as I thought. Still pretty bad considering it looks more like a north Indian state than a south Indian state from this map. Its funny that people are supporting CAA and NRC to give prosecuted minorities from neighboring countries citizenship while there are far more minorities inside the country who face discrimination and what not on a daily basis but no one cares for their pain.
Makes me wonder if the CAA and NRC is just a political stunt for vote bank or the govt really cares about the minorities. And mainland Indians have the audacity to think that the Eastern states are junglee and un-civillised. 


Completely fed up of this bigotry. How has no one mentioned Bengal, as clean(no red spots) as Maharashtra if not more. The reforms that started here spread to the villages with the 40 year communist rule instilling the values into deeper sections of society and peripheral villages too. I'm not a proponent of hardcore communism, but I feel it has had it's share of good effects amongst the many bad ones. As a North Easterner, we have our issues but mainland cancer like dowry and caste system doesnt have a foothold. Also, people eat whatever the F they want without fear of lynching! It is a tragedy that despite Dalits being more reformed in maharastra , they never attained political power like Dalits of UP, Bihar where Dalits have their own mainstream party.

All credit goes to Sharad pawar who ensure that Dalits never get mobilised. This is actually not a good measure as in reality, the figures would be much higher as many practice it but deny it Go Kerala! I'm a malayalee mumbaikar, I didn't even know this was still a thing One interesting thing I noticed is that even though this is a per-district depiction, the trends nearly line up cleanly according to the state borders.

This goes to show how the standardized mini-subcultures within each state influence people's values. The case of Bengal, Kerala, and Maharashtra is especially striking relative to their neighbhors. I hope there will be a time where it's gone completely. Proud to see Maharashtra being a progressive in this regard. wait, that looks like South Indians are more progressive and have liberal views than North India. I am shocked at Haryana. I thought they would be higher in list. *Funny how Gujarat is still a major contributor to this even considering it is the homestate of the country* I Lepe forgetting maharashtra is above Karnataka, they don't talked about much. don't know when India Will be free of all these things Very happy to see kolhapur in the white Extremely surprised to see Jains had the highest ""Yes"" percentage at 35%. I've generally considered Jains to be relatively socially forward but I guess I've been living in a liberal bubble. This is honestly very disappointing. It's 2020 now, and the practice of untouchability is still prevalent? Honestly, by now you'd thin the education system would have worked at least a little. Growing up in MP, I lived in the decently sized city of Jabalpur. My dad was a police officer back when we were in India, and he got posted to a police station out in a village somewhere. The place was about an hour drive, so we used to go there on weekends or when we didn't feel like going to school.

This one time, during summer vacation, we were there for maybe 3 weeks. My brother and I used to go out and play in the fields or whatever all day long. This one time him, a few other friends, and I were playing around where we got our feel all covered in mud. After we were done, before we going home we decided to stop at this hand pump to wash out feet. We waited while this outer kid, around our age, was filling up about 3 matkas with water. He filled them all up, and left with 2 of them and said he'll be right back. While he was gone, I decided to wash my feet (his 3rd matka was out of the way). He comes back, see's me washing my feel, and gets pissed the fuck off. He doesn't say anything to me (since my father was the police incharge of the area), but he did say something to one of our friends in a Hindi dielect I didn't understand and then he threw out all the water from the matka. Confused, I asked my friend what was going on? He said this guys is from some higher caste, and they don't drink or eat anything that has come into contact with someone from a lower cast. I said I'm not even Hindu, I'm Sikh. He said since he doesn't know your caste, he's treating you as a lower caste and will refill the water.

That's when I realized shit like untouchability and caste system is still alive and well in India. An obvious and visible form of untouchability would be less harmful than invisible form where higher casts do not show they are treating lower cast people in an inferior manner but just not include  them in daily activities. Pleasantly surprised seeing Maharashtra stand alone seeing surrounded by a sea of red.

Also surprised it's not all white in Kerala. Have heard of pockets in Kasargod area that drops into Karnataka. Work needs to be done.

Extremely shocked seeing TN though. Source is from University of Maryland. Are there any citations for this research? Vegetarianism is directly proportional to Caste system if we go by this chart Anyone surprised by Gujrat being in same category as UP, Bihar? Not me. Just curious, why is the North always kinda backwards? I guess it takes a long time for people to break traditional bigotry like it does racism, generations. How is this measured? How do they collect data for this one? By asking people ? Source ? Telangana isn't quite there yet but hey, we're getting there.. some progress is better than no progress Nagaland? Really ? Which year or when was it conducted? As expected from Amiths Maharashtra looking so fair and lovely, but my home state odisha makes me sad end classism If you see south indians and west Indians are very intelligent Bengal has a lot of bad things but on this one it doesn't disappoint much , I'm curious about South Bengal because personally I haven't heard about it. Proud to be from Kerala!!! Cow belt ftw The cow-belt is clearly visbile here.


Apparently making people eating beef will ensure they don't practice untouchability :)

It would also improve their literacy & give the people brains to elect better leaders.

/s Proud to be a Maratha Can someone overlay the 2019 election result over this map ? How old is this? Telangana's borders aren't on this map. Feeling Ashamed from Himachal Pradesh. I belong to the western part, Dharamshala. But the sad thing is that  so called modern areas like Shimla, Manali and Mandi are dark. It's always interesting seeing the correlation between bigotry and distance from the coast. proud of my state(Maharashtra) ^_^ As you go south , Indians get wiser . Marathi people have strong character. Well proud to be from state of Maharashtra. Land of Reformers. Shivaji Maharaj, Mahatama Jyotirao Phule, Savatri  Phule, Gokhale, ....... its huge.

Shahu Maharaj a prominent King(1874-1920) and more a reformer who setup different boarding school for different community. Abolished Mahar act, appointed non brahmin for Vedic  education, Supported Dr ambedkar during his struggling period. Free education to all during his regime. Shahu Maharaj arranged intercaste marriage of his sister  **Chandraprabhabai.**

&#x200B;

These all contributed greatly towards decreasing of untouchablilty in Maharashtra. Ah, MP is the hidden thug, often outshined by classic thugs like UP & Bihar, thanks to their massive population. 

Apart from less population density, MP is just another UP-Bihar,  it’s poor (gdp per capita: India ~$1,900, MP- $1,300, UP- $1000, Bihar - $900), has lower average literacy - 69% (2011) and it’s casteist and belongs to cow belt.

Edit; Cow belt aside Odisha & Assam have higher untouchablity practices in districts with high tribal populations (southern Odisha & eastern Assam). Is it a coincidence that all red marked states are mostly under BJP government? Look at the cow belt Nagaland? Are you kidding? First of all, we don't even have a caste system. Second of all, the indigenous people of the state mainly practice Christianity and untouchability has its roots in the Hindu caste system. I'm not really sure but besides Christianity, I suppose people in some of the far-flung places worship nature, so there's that.

But even then, if there is any validity to this data, I can vouch for the fact that this isn't because of the indigenous people. It is probably because of the migrants from other parts of India that's causing this. I haven't been much to Maharastra in my life. Any good reasons why it's so progressive in this metric? The caste system is here to stay so long as people feel proud about having born into their respective caste. Kerala Gang Rise Up My state is in a very dire state Telangana isn't quite there yet but hey, we're getting there.. some progress is better than no progress Very true and disappointing. It is so bad that a majority of people have accepted it the way it is. But there's hope from folks like we have in this community. dated? Can you provide link of this survey ? I just want to share it with other guys. Is this for 2019? How did theh even collect the Data Very disappointing picture, the middle horizontal strip area of India is still suffering with this problem. I believe educated has to play a great role to eradicate this menace. These data are chocking for everyone, a lot of work still needed This is a ten year old dataset Op, can you give us some insight on the questions asked in that survey? This just makes the case, north India is the shitty part How was this data collected any link to the source ? [deleted] The fact that the cow belt is not just red color is a victory, cannot expect any more.., How are such data ever gathered? 

I am genuinely curious. This is depressing. How about some religious artwork to cheer ppl up Surprised Telugu states are on the lighter side. I wonder how the data would look for the age below 30 Could very well be BJP rules states map. 

Oh wait. To be honest, I've never seen untouchability in Punjab. Awful seeing this. [removed] People commenting on north/south india, casually ignoring north-east..as usual Meanwhile my parents rejecting an arranged marriage proposal where the girl is from untouchable class. J&k is white due to snow You know us North Indians are the root of the problem when it's more concentrated in our area. Proud of my state West Bengal. And all the cow belt states are dragging India behind... #Gutkha-khods Interesting to see Punjab that low. Sikhism? Peasants and their problems West Bengal :-) North India still stuck in the stone age, while South focuses on education and development. if you notice it's the north side :pwe southerners are humble people lul Would be interesting to see the data for literacy rate and per capital along with this I don't understand why North India is so backward. South Is way better in almost everything. Can you explain what it means to an American Sikh? Goddamn I’m proud of Kerala! Non-Indian here, isn't untouchability prohibited by the Constitution? I though this bs died put long ago Would someone be kind enough to ELI5 the “Practice of Untouchability” in India for a foreigner coming in from r/all? me: * a north indian *

also me: those goddamn north indians 😤 mera bharat mahan Which year's data is this ? What is untouchability? Wow! We as a country Can't grow unless we get united. What does Household Practicing mean? That untouchability is practiced in households?? In brazil we just call them poor people jai jai maharashtra maza [deleted] wtf is Gujrat and Rajasthan doing? Hey American here. I’ve had classes on the class systems of India but am by far no expert and those were years ago. Was wondering if someone could explain this and if it still has to do with traditional ideals or if there is a different drive for it in present times? Any answers are appreciated. India world power 2020, biggest joke of the year Just by looking at the map, it doesn't seem to correlate with economic progress. I'm very keen to know what other metrics they can do stats with. That's the worst thing we are continuing in India. Okay. I find this hard to believe. It could be the ratio of people that believe in the caste system, but who even practices untouchability still? So crazy, as a westerner who visited India last year I had no clue this was still happening. Its so hard to pick up on all of the nuances and I guess many tourists just boil it all down to 'crazy shit everywhere' and 'chaos' haha.

 Quite sad to see that still takes place. This is shocking... when will the people learn. What is untouchability?? Hope it's more white now since the data has to be atleast 5 years old as telengana is not shown as a state . Himachal has high literacy rate and hight untouchability. 👏 Cow belt being cow belt doing gobar practices As a Tamilan, I feel ashamed. Almighty will free whole the country from Untouchability in India!! Sab Changa Si, can you free India from Untouchability si??? This doesn't seem right¿
Given its done by University of Maryland, I'm sure there wasn't groundwork done and a lot of assumptions were made This might also be kind of mis represented. as it just looks at households. But if someone is homeless, living on the streets, can still be facing untouchability. But in just the context of how certain states don't practice untouchability within people who can afford houses. What year is this report mate? Indore has zero untouchability practice. I am shocked, why does himachal has high percentage? കേരളം Quite surprised to see the data on Maharashtra especially given the Manuwadi RSS operates out of there. When was this data made ? If its an old one then definitely the numbers change will due to the rise of hindutva I don't believe this... Pretty sure the conclusion is based on very limited test cases I wonder how good this data is and what sample of people have been surveyed? This looks so flawed that i cannot even fathom the sheeple and ignorance on this subreddit. For example the darkest region is delhi and 50% of them practice untouchability. wake up sheeple - have you ever been to delhi??? Have you even heard of untouchability in delhi ? it is the most metropolitan city you will ever see . In buses the problem is over crowding and everyone touching eachother and not the other way around.

You are being pawned - use your brain for god sake. Do not think this is correct picture especially for Gujarat. Spent close to two decades there, never encountered untouchability. Castesism yes but no untouchability. I wouldn't trust the data. Link to the source would really help to validate the authenticity of the work. Can anyone provide link for this? I'm from doon i never seen anyone practicing this I'm American what is untouchability? Proud to be a south indian!! Another L for India A headsup, this dataset had been published in Year 2011-12. So data collected is almost a decade old. Wtf is untouchability.  Sounds like a good suit name.

edit: untouchable = poor Hindu [removed] [removed] [deleted] Similar to what we call today - The Reservation

&#x200B;

ffs Sadly I come from a state which is extensively red and one common sentiment that I have seen among people is reservation which is messing up with the poor people who belong to upper caste. Most of the upper class soo called 'brahmanical patriarchy' families have not been able to make their ends meet. They say that reservation and caste discrimination will go hand in hand. On the one hand you don't want to be called by the name of your caste but you'll jump with joy if the government is giving you reservations for the same. Sad but truth."
260,Scheduled,People are still hoarding,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fx3t1t/people_are_still_hoarding/,"I went to Dmart today morning. They had a long queue of people ( atleast 150), maintaining physical distance,  waiting to buy the essential items. And, each and every person was buying in bulk, hoarding essential items so that they don't have to wait in huge queue again. 

 As I entered the supermarket after waiting for almost 1.5 hrs in the heat of Mumbai, I could hear some people mildly coughing, sneezing  and Dmart staff advising them to take their supplies and leave fast. I think we may  have reached Stage 3 and Supermarkets are new hotbeds for COVID-19."," I think now would be a good time to go back to pre mart Era practices. A single window dispensing the items. You pre-book whatever you need and pick it up at scheduled time. Of course this would be easier for smaller towns and villages but with proper coordination and management it can be done in bigger cities as well. Things would not be as bad of the authorities did not prevent you from moving out to get your stuff like they are doing now Is buying a week's ration for family of 4 hoarding? This isn't hoarding. The current recommendation in a lot of countries is to buy a weeks grocery at a time, so you don't ha e to leave home any more often than that. If you think about how much a joint family goes through in a week, it might seem like hoarding, but it's actually the recommended strategy. I think the whole idea about hoarding is that you don't have to get out of your house anytime soon, so that you can have your supplies stocked up, but yes you're right it is probably the new hotbet for the virus Better to buy from the friendly neighborhood baniya. For this same reason iam avoiding going to crowded or popular supermarket, going to lesser known or less crowded seems better and they have a lot items available due to less coming to them There's no clarity when and how the lockdown will end. There are no assurances from government and in times of opaque information flow, chaos will ensue. I think taking as much as you can store and keep is a good idea.. It minimizes the number of times you need to go out and reduces the risk of your own exposure, your family's exposure and the chances of you spreading to others in case you're an asymptomatic carrier..

You're going to use it over the next week or two weeks anyways, as long as you don't let it spoil, so it evens out. You're not depriving anyone, you're reducing chances of infection.

262,Scheduled,Has anyone in India successfully been able to replace their maids with a Roomba?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g0dgtk/has_anyone_in_india_successfully_been_able_to/,Just curious. If anyone has bought a Roomba or another type or robot vacuum and are currently using it in your home/office?," i have successfully replaced my maid with me. The Roomba did the job well but getting the spares as and when we needed them was problematic and the robot itself was a bit on the pricier side imo. Not to mention it was rather noisy after 7 months of use. We had a Roomba 631 from 2016 to early 2019.

We then purchased the second generation Mi vaccum cleaner from Xiaomi and it definitely beats the Roomba we had in terms of noise and battery life. Spares is still an issue but Alibaba has some trustworthy sellers so it's not an issue if we order in a month advance. Not to mention, the spares are cheaper.

We also have a iRobot Braava mopping robot. I would recommend it only if your house has small rooms. Not at all , i own a roomba i7 and an m6 .

Both have their own tantrums at random days(someday i7 would not follow it’s map while someday m6 would take hours to complete one room done) .  I would not say it is a total replacement for maids . How much does it cost? Shiney Ahuja? I gifted my mom with a Roomba and a Brava. She has scheduled Roomba to run on Tuesday and Thursday but she she cleans the house on the weekend herself. 

The tiny Brava on the other hand can’t be scheduled though it works really well on smooth surfaces. She uses brava only in the main hall as it uses a different navigation system.

But both of them does take a lot of load off. Me and my wife ordered a Bosch Dishwasher for ourselves just a week before the lockdown. We were quite sceptical whether it will be able to clean properly or not. But to our surprise no maid can match a dishwasher wash. However you can not wash utensils made of aluminium, copper etc. I have ..does a fab Job too ..very helpful at times like these.. I use eufy 11S. Love it. Great simple tool and does a perfect job everyday. I had gotten an I-robot roomba 966 three years ago because I have two cats and fur does *not* get swept up by a broom. It's been going strong since then and I run it almost daily. Cleans my 2bhk in an hour well enough that I can walk without slippers and not feel any grit on my feet. I just have to make sure that there's not water or any cat toys on the floor before running it because they get trapped in it's brushes and I have to clean them up.

It's seriously a life-saver. They've launched new models recently with washable filters now and xiaomi has one that even mops. I'm tempted to upgrade to the xiaomi one in the future! My Xiaomi Robot Vacuum works better and more efficiently than any human ever could. So definitely.

Sometimes I run it over clean white floors and it still sucks up an astonishing amount of dust."

Everything else is camouflage to get the status cleared. As I recall constitution doesn't provide any definition or criterion for a community to be deemed ST. Parliament can include or exclude any community as ST if it thinks so. I think if the community is strong enough and is able to cause a big enough disruption to the country\\area while asking for it, they get it [Article 342](http://vikaspedia.in/social-welfare/scheduled-tribes-welfare/ministry-of-tribal-welfare)

How does the nearest confirmed case tool work? Are the whatsapp groups any active ? The last tip is incorrect:

> Do not wear a facemask if you arent sick
>
> You do not need to wear a facemask unless you are caring for someone who is sick (and they are not able to wear a facemask). Facemasks may be in short supply and they should be saved for caregivers.

Increasingly, this is proving to be bad advice (even though it is WHO-supplied), and face masks are shown to reduce transmission. Doesn't have to be N95, even a cloth or handkerchief will help.

From [a study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322931/):

> S. Wearing masks outside the home in a reference period corresponding to the 2 weeks before symptom onset for cases was significantly protective against clinical SARS. Supporting the validity of this finding, there was a dose-response effect: by multivariable analysis, persons who always wore masks had a 70% lower risk of being diagnosed with clinical SARS compared with those who never wore masks, and persons with intermittent mask use had a 60% lower risk. Many persons who wore masks in the community did not use N-95 or similar highly efficient filtration devices, which have been recommended for use in the hospital setting.

I loved the design on my phone, perhaps the most responsive mobile  website I've seen. Also +1 for no ads. how about a list of novels/books to read? Nice.

You guys should consider adding 'Khosla ka Ghosla' in the movies list somewhere. Loved the HIMYM pic you've used to represent Tv series, usually it's GoT I would love to contribute. Amazing! One suggestion you can add a general aged group based online learning material. I see this is Open source. I'll try forking. Great work. You are a good man OP!

Is the nearby town safe at midnight for family?"," I am assuming by car.

Unless you are like a real enthu astro/aero geek. I wouldn't recommend esp with family. More than safety, it will be very tiring, if you are trying to drive up and down in one shot.

If you break it up into 2 night trip it will be better idea. Pulikat lake is quite a sight esp if the birds are in town. Find a decent hotel within 1hr distance along the highway. Town everything will be booked up esp for this launch.

There is just one road leading to the site and security will stop you 5-6 km away, but you can take the mud road along the lake to the right of that security check point and find a good place to sit.

There are hundreds of people these days who watch from that road. It's not crowded or anything because its a very large lake bed and you can see the launch from any point along that road.

Also go post/read on r/isro you might find a lot more details from others  there.

If its not cloudy and weather is good, a night launch is pure magic. I want the answers too. Do we need to buy a ticket or something? Heard from someone that you could buy tickets couple of months before the launch.

At a time when most politicians are playing it safe in Delhi , thank you Mr. Pinarayi Vijayan for this gesture.  

Mr JNU VC , take a hint ? A similar gesture by narendra would have created immense goodwill and restored a lot of confidence in him. But that guy is so horribly evil inside that this seemingly compassionate and great for propaganda act also repulses him. Its Kerala baby She should stay away from all politicians. At the end of the day they will use her for their own benefit. Kanhaiya put it accurately in his speech at JNU Opposition parties should learn from him. 

If all regional parties stand with her. It will be good. The way, this is. Not really, its still blatant politics. The actual way would have been the fucking Delhi Police not allowing this to happen. ""This is the way"", even Mandalorian's know it. Kind of funny, for me personally, when I see CM Vijayan like this. SFI Kerala is notorious for conducting the JNU-like attacks using DYFI and CITU goons across campuses in Kerala. Just Google SFI University College Thiruvananthapuram and you'll get a fair idea.

275,Scheduled,I am from Shaheen Bagh and I hope the protest here ends.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fahqeu/i_am_from_shaheen_bagh_and_i_hope_the_protest/,"I remember the day of violence at Jamia university. I had just come from office and one of my friend who was in the rally that had tried marching towards parliament and as soon as it had reached Mathura Road, a major road in Delhi, the rally faced an unexpected amount of force from police, a violent lathi-charge. He said, people ran in all directions and cops chased them all over. Next thing he sees is buses burning, police firing gun on protestors. 

All I said to him is, "" I wish people didn't protest because this will not yield anything"", he didn't believe me so, I switched on my TV and showed him the narrative that was spun on the incident by media. He was shocked. Next day Shaheen Bagh protest started and rest is history. But never once did I think from day one that BJP will talk or courts will intervene. And never believed that this was a good idea as Shaheen Bagh road is major thoroughfare between Noida , Delhi, Faridabad and Gurgaon and hence it will only make more haters because I know most people don't really care what the Indian Muslim thinks. 

It has all come true, and today as more than ever, I wish this protest ended. 

I was brought up in India and never did I consider this country to be more than a Hindu nation, with Muslims living in their ""aukaat"". I grew up watching Mahabharata, Ramayana and om namah shivay on government owned national television, visited government offices with temples and other unlimited signs of Hinduism in government that established that. As you grew older, met kids who had never met a Muslim and knew zilch about Islam but could tell you 100s of stereotypes about Muslims as facts. Countless incidents made an imprint on you and you learnt to keep your head down and just live in your ghetto. But now my ghetto, which is chose for security over facilities is gone. 

But the thing is, I had learnt to live with that. But this protest makes me feel unsafe. I feel noticed. I don't want that. Till this protest , nobody knew what was Shaheen Bagh, I liked that. Now I feel exposed and worried that I might have crossed my ""aukaat"" and will soon feel the punishment for it. So please my friends at the protest, please stop it.



PS: just my rant, thought, don't downvote because you don't agree, kindly comment or else move on.

Edit : I also do not want the protest to end. You have to understand that as a Muslim in India, I am used to keeping my head down and going on with life. But this, this is totally new. This is a revolt of a sort, which totally makes lots of people among us nervous, we get these thoughts and I just articulated it here. Thank you all for the support and understanding."," Well if the protest ends here then its a amit shah victory he got a new template.... dangay karao protest khatam and you will see that applied all over india. If someone is protesting peacefully against injustice they have every right I understand and empathize with your perspective. However, if you want the protest to end, that means you are okay with giving up the only resistance there exists against the CAA. Without the protests (and essentially no one being outraged), the Act gets implemented silently and obediently, and you are at the mercy of this genocidal government. You are okay with atrocities being committed against people of your religion and possibly you yourself. There is literally no other fight available to people right now other than peaceful protesting, even if it may eventually lead to nothing. At least it keeps international media attention on India and possibly reduces the damage inflicted on Muslims or postpones it. Unless you have a better alternative than protesting.

If you are okay with protesting, but not in Shaheen Bagh because it makes your life more difficult, and would rather that the protests moved elsewhere in a different locality, your argument is selfish, albeit valid, but undoubtedly selfish. And there's no merit in that for me, sorry. You would rather that someone else gets inconvenienced and threatened, and while of course that may be a natural reaction, it is not very endearing. No, OP. 

Do you think that if all protests end , the hatred will stop? 

No. 

Do you know what bjp's no. 1 weapon is? 

It is hate. Hate will always exist in people's hearts unless these hindutva goons sitting in the Centre are thrown. We need everyone in our country to realise that hateful hyper nationalism is very bad. Oppression is very bad. 


And it is only achievable through protests. Times are hard now but trust me when I say that this protest is the only reason people have hope right now. They already had the chronology planned they always had the plan to attack the minorities. We all know what they wanted. But the protest made a revolt against them and people not only from minorities but also the majority of Hindu’s started joining. This protest is not between Hindu and muslims. Its a protest of the educated vs the oppressor. They want you to go weak and they will land the first blow. But they cant take away the hope and the unity of the people because religion comes after humanity. You can be a muslim or a hindu but firstly we’re an Indian and we learnt to respect all the religions. I understand your opinion and perspective but I have a question for you. Would you also advice women in your house to cooperate with the rapist to reduce the pain in case someone attacks them? We've seen similar events play out in Indian history multiple times. But just taking events which have been done by the duo at the helm of the country right now:

* If Gujarat is any indication, there might be pogroms in the future for Muslims followed by segregated housing (similar to Ahmedabad).

* If Assam is any indication, the NRC process will be brutal, imprecise and disproportionately affect poor people.

* If the Kashmiri Pandit exodus/genocide is any indication, the (current) ruling party is willing to just keep using some token crowd as a political prop to suit its agenda without actually doing anything for them.

* If modern Kashmir is any indication, the government is willing cut off basic necessities (e.g. internet) for months just to enforce their police state, jail people without reason etc.

* If the demonetization is any indication, the government is willing to put its own citizens at huge risk just to win an election (UP election) and on the basis of some tinpot economics.

If you look at other events in Indian history (Sikh riots, Kashmiri Pandit exodus, Mumbai riots of 1993, 1983 Nellie massacre) we can see the patterns emerge here as well.

We've seen such events play out elsewhere in the world too. India is not unique in this respect.

The NRC-CAA process preceded by a pogrom? Your documents will burn in your houses and then you'll be forced to somehow produce those documents to prove your citizenship. It'll leave a lot of casualties - and now only the non-Muslims will get citizenship back through CAA. You go to a 'detention' camp.

This is an existential crisis for Muslims so I'm not surprised that they are taking to the streets...

Let's not forget this

         Because I was not a socialist.

> -Martin Niemoller You have put into words what I have been feeling for the longest time.

:( Was there a need to mention that she was dalit? Was she raped because she was a dalit?

I'm just asking, not implying or stating anything. Alas, some good news. Why does this case read like a case of opportunistic rape and murder and not a premeditated crime because the victim was a dalit?

Those monsters got what they deserved and can rot in hell for all I care but I suspect the govt in slapping the SC/ST act just because the accused were muslims. I smell a rat her.

279,Scheduled,Trains availability and schedule flexibility,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dsf0wr/trains_availability_and_schedule_flexibility/,"Me and my wife will be travelling for 2 weeks in India in mid December. Our route is (in that order): New Delhi, Jaipur, Agra, Kanpur, Varanasi, Kolkata and we want to use trains to move between them. On one hand it's safer and more robust to book everything online and not worry about the ticketing, but on the other we want to be flexible since nothing goes as planned.

What would you recommend? What's your experience?"," Travelling in trains in India on non-reserved tickets is not something you would want to do. 

There's only about a month left so you better hurry and book your tickets on www.irctc.co.in otherwise you would not even get a reserved ticket.

To have a better idea about what type of tickets to book, search for 'What does 1A, 2A, 3A, SL, CC, 2S mean in Indian trains'. I would recommend you to book 3AC tickets.

Edit: You can book tickets 1 day before train's departure day under Tatkal quota too but it's risky and its costs extra money. Tickets can be sold out in under 5 minutes after it opens. You will get tickets easily even in Tatkal a day before while you are travelling Kanpur to Varanasi and Varanasi to Kolkata. 
I always used to take tickets a day before while I was living in Kolkata and coming to Varanasi my hometown. 

One of my friend used to stay in Kanpur and I often used to visit it in the same manner. .

If nothing is planned and you want a flexible journey, then you can do tickets a day before but be a little cautious and do it as soon as ticket booking opens, which is 10 a.m for A.c class and 11 a.m for sleeper class.  I would suggest you to book confirm ticket now, if it is available. You can cancel it later, if there is a change of plan and book a Tatkal ticket. 

You can text me if you want more information about the places to visit or any help or have any confusion regarding these cities. Get the NTES app on your phone for live train status. It's the official app and it's good. Do you have a non Indian passport ? Foreigners have a quota in most major trains and you can purchase reserved tickets under this category from major train stations like New Delhi Railway station. It might be difficult to find seats in regular category on trains if you use the online route as trains get booked fairly in advance. Goodluck !

And Connections between various orgs were strengthened.

Know (build awareness of) the various orgs in your region and help build connections between them.

When the next round happens, and it will, the more organized people and groups are govt starts backing down from instant automatic reactions.

https://twitter.com/NrcProtest/status/1214091227475267584?s=09 Mods, please sticky this. We need more people to go out and fight fascism.  The point of relay protests is to maintain a continual, peaceful resistance without a reduction in numbers. To do this, people take turns to participate, rest, and rejoin, much like relay races.

Unlike rallies, relay protests usually take place at a fixed spot. People bring supplies such as food and sleeping bags to stay for long periods of time.

Relay protests are much more likely to attract media attention without disrupting peace and order. This is due to their long-term, continuous nature. People's determination and dedication to the cause shines through. Especially in cases like Shaheen Bagh, where the protests continued despite the nail-biting winters of the North through Christmas and New Year's.

If anything the need of the hour is to go right for the jugular. Get rid of incompetent prime minister and home minister. Tadipar wants to make these protests as violent as he can. So,he will use all possible methods to rile up people, and once they do become violent,  he will use police brutality to suppress the dissenters forever I'm looking for a protest to join near Dallas, TX. 

I had seen a post which mentioned protests planned for various cities in the US, including Houston on 26th Jan, but I'm not able to find it anymore. Any protests planned for today @ chennai? Couldn't make it for the last one.."

283,Scheduled,Vegetarianism in India has more to do with caste hierarchy than love for animals,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eogkmk/vegetarianism_in_india_has_more_to_do_with_caste/,"
Why do vegetarians in India prefer social distance from non-vegetarians? A look at caste-wise food preferences could provide some insights. As is common knowledge, the ranking of castes is mostly influenced by purity of occupation and diet. In caste-society, to achieve purity of body and spirit, it is necessary to be a vegetarian and religious simultaneously – something best embodied by a Brahmin.

The percentage of non-vegetarians among Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, both for men and women, is much higher than among those who are not from these communities. And in the latter group, the highest incidence of vegetarianism is found among Brahmins at almost over 50%. The higher the caste, the greater the possibility of them being pure vegetarians.

The burden of diet-purity and vegetarianism is, however, more on women than men.

Broadly, present-day vegetarianism in India constitutes a form of moral power of minority within Hindus, with such a power being forced on the non-vegetarian majority – with their consent. This new sociality is a sign of progress in modern caste belief where the seductive power of vegetarianism and its associated purity travels seamlessly across bodies and spaces without dissent.

How fragile must the morals of the vegetarian castes be if they feel threatened by the introduction of eggs for poor children in schools? The morals of Indian vegetarians continue to be based less on compassion for humans and animals, and more driven by ideas of hierarchy and purity. In this scheme of hierarchy, one who eats beef is placed at the lowest rung. Like humans of caste, not all animals carry equal sympathy: there exists some hierarchy where the cow (indigenous, not jersey) takes the highest sacral form compared to the rest. Gandhi improvised his vegetarianism through inflicting violence and control on the self. Present-day caste-subjects and their vegetarianism, however, thrive on violence, both on the self and others. The state across India through various governments has mostly been party to this process, promoting the hegemony of misguided vegetarianism."," People in the Northeast do not seem to have any dietary restrictions

However, the problem arises when bigots and racists use this to demonstrate their ‘non-Indianess’ for in their logic such people could only be ‘Chinese’ If you want to see how Caste affects the perception of non-vegetarianism look no further than Tamil Nadu. The majority of the state is non-vegetarian. It has an incredibly developed Non-vegetarian cuisine. Ask anyone outside the south about the perception of Tamilians and its always vegetarian. Majority of the reason is because outside the state the vast majority of Tamilians working are Brahmins (especially in civil service), and most of the eateries outside the state are run by Brahmins. For those that don’t know, this is Dalit cuisine

Would you eat this? Perhaps if you were starving and nothing else was available to you? That is why these people started eating them! [removed] I’m not telling everyone to eat non-veg, beef or pork. I know the last two are unfathomable for most of us. However, those that want to eat them should have no restrictions. There never used to be any such laws before and this was the traditional diet of many communities Gai doodh nahi deti hai, hum usse le lete hai. Spot on. It's not like we are an animal or nature-loving society otherwise. It's all caste, masquerading as lifestyle choices. I belong to small backwards village in UP where we didn’t have electricity until a few years ago

Outside our village was a basti of the Chamars

They certainly did not eat lithi chokha unless it was given to them as leftovers. All they were entitled to eat was the leftovers of higher castes and they used to take the joothan of both Hindus and Muslims without discrimination. I am haunted by a moment when I was around 10 years old and ran after the ice cream cycle and bought an ice cream and I was greedily eating it like a pig while a boy the same age as me but from the Chamar community was staring at the ice cream and at me and I still remember the look on his father’s face. His father wanted to buy one for his son as well and went after the ice cream man. My mother told me to eat it away from them so that they cannot see and ‘najar nahi lagegi’ 

They ate pig and breed them and would sacrifice a pig every year to their caste god. They also ate the flesh of all dead animals. They ate lizards, jackals, mongoose I don't get the cow fascination most cows are domesticated so they grow up for sole purpose of feeding milk to the population so why get offended when people eat it I mean the cow served same purpose in both cases to feed people, I will never get the cow thing it's so stupid. 
My great grandfather(Brahmin) moved to West Bengal and since then most of our family members are non vegetarians but still beef is very sensitive topic. I hope someday we can see through this bs it's a domesticated animal people stop getting offended. I am sorry but you are using the words ""Indian"" and ""caste"" very vaguely. I am an upper caste Brahmin from the Bengal originally and there is no such restriction for any caste. In fact even the ""pujari"" eats non veg after doing puja, in fact he is fed before everyone else can eat. Also, same is the case in kashmiri shaivism and a lot of other tantric sects as well. 

It is only a few ""elitist"" brahmins (mostly vaishnavites). Who promote such ideas and should be looked down upon because they spoil the name of Hinduism. We are a very vast culture with many schools of thought we can't demean Hinduism entirely just because a part of it is very casteist. We need to learn, re-write and re-narrate Hinduism to the masses.

There is a lot of hindutva propaganda. But let's try to see though it and not kill beef eaters or look down upon meat eaters. 

PS: I did upvote because you started a great convo here. We need more and more diverse voices Just like everything else in india Such hypocrisy is ripe in India and I personally feel there is a need for drastic change that would make the society casteless and classless may be I’m wrong but it’s time for a change in mindset of people. Of course most people in this country don't actually care about animals. We all see and ignore the plight of street animals every single day. By that argument are Jains and Bhuddists also forcing vegetarianism ? Or is it only the Brahmins who are espousing vegetarianism on everyone. 

Kshatriyas were warriors and kings. They ate meat. So to say vegetarianism has to do a lot with casteism is being a bit dishonest. 

Indian cuisine is one of the few which organically has so much vegetarian food choices instead of just meat substitutes. It is sad that even that is used to fuel hatred on this sub. 

Hope you find peace OP. What is this? Bootleg scroll article? This write up is sprinkled with gems like,

>Broadly, present-day vegetarianism in India constitutes a form of moral power of minority within Hindus, with such a power **being forced on** the non-vegetarian majority – **with their consent**.

Da fuq.

Another gem,

>The burden of diet-purity and vegetarianism is, however, more on women than men.

Hmm what?? Why is this nonsense just there right in the middle without any preface and conclusion?

And wonderful theorem proving techniques. To prove,

>**Vegetarianism in India has more to do with caste hierarchy than love for animals**

Goes on to assume the same thing,

>The morals of Indian vegetarians continue to be based less on compassion for humans and animals, and more driven by ideas of hierarchy and purity.

*Proof:* Assume theorem is true => Theorem is true now. Done<>

&#x200B;

There are many things wrong with caste, but vegetarianism isn't one of them. So vegetarianism is bad because of Brahmins? I feel nowadays caste based vegetarianism is like forced practice I have friends who belong to the swami caste yet they eat meat and stuff outside in secret and practice vegetarianism at home. This is pure BS.  

People are non vegetarian because that comes naturally to them and easily accessible. In today's world we don't even need to rely on meat as we can get majority of required supplements with veg counterparts and remaining can be found in eggs. Most Baniyas/Vaishyas are vegetarian. Kshatriyas have a high percentage of meat eaters. Any “ism” is more about moral superiority than the real thing. Absolutely. We're a hypocritical bunch with dung for brains. If we had the sense to look beyond Brahmin India, we'd see how people thrive with non-vegetarian food in their diets. It's beyond cringe to see our athletes against say, Australian or New Zealand athletes. When we moved to the UK initially we had the problem of halal haram coming from a Muslim family but later we decided to abandon these customs for a few reasons:

1. In this country you cannot see the animal being slaughtered, so you do not really know if it is halal and since most of the animals are stunned beforehand, it so not valid. Thus you cannot be sure of the provenance of meat even if it is from a halal animal

2. It is not convenient to be restricted to certain foods. We lived in a White British area and not some Desi ghetto where everything is halal or vegetarian. Most of the things I grew to like actually consumed pork such as sausages, pate,  etc. Which either my parents knew had pork but did not care or they really didn’t know

3. Islamophobia and also the mentality of most Muslims in modern times makes me want to distance myself from them

4. Me and my father, mother are technically atheist or agnostic, so why not eat pork?

5. I used to try to be vegetarian as far as possible but I love meat too much so it didn’t last long I'm an avid non vegetarian. I don't crave pork or mutton coz i much rather prefer the chicken-egg-fish combo.

If you have to bring it up to castes well even among the so called brahmins there are sub casts and I happen to belong to top of them. And in my entire region, across casts and whatever subsections you want to indulge in or care for, having the ability to have fish regularly is among the top prosperous blessings our ever so orthodox ancestors can bestow upon us.

While it's easier to chalk it up to caste. The choice and stigma of vegetarianism is more about the region and the kind of people who've rose to power in those regions from ancient times. But most of it lies with people who cling to unfounded beliefs in the name of ""culture"" and not having the sense or ability to question why things are so.

PS: pretty much any class of people have had access to and have consumed some section of non vegetarian food. Just go through the manuscripts from the courts of any kings and such you can get your hands on. Bengali brahmins eats fish. It has nothing to do with caste but everything to do with religion. Naturally some random beliefs might get right. Definitely nothing to do with compassion for animals either. BS ->
>As is common knowledge, 

Common knowledge is WRONG, all the time, not most of the times, all the times. 


>the ranking of castes is mostly influenced by purity of occupation and diet

Wrong again, the mostly part is wrong as well as the entire sentence 



>, to achieve purity of body and spirit, it is necessary to be a vegetarian and religious simultaneously

Who told you? 



>is much higher than among those who are not from these communities

This proves nothing and helps in NO WAY to make the point you are trying to make. 



> The higher the caste, the greater the possibility of them being pure vegetarians

This proves nothing, and you have no data to proof this, and you have not even defined the higher and lower. Your ranking of higher and lower is based upon an argument you tried to make before, which makes your assertion circular, ergo no signal but noise. 


> burden of diet-purity and vegetarianism is, however, more on women than men.

Who told you?  It is not a burden but a choice. Just because you cannot accept other women's choices does not mean your labelling of their choice as burden is correct. 




>of moral power of minority within Hindus

Wrong again

> be if they feel threatened by the introduction

Circular argument again, it's their choice, and it their right to protest. It is their right to PROTEST AGAINST THE THINGS THEY DO NOT LIKE. just because you do not like their rights and choices does not mean you are correct. Do not poke your nose into other's people choices and rights. 

> In this scheme of hierarchy, one who eats beef is placed at the lowest rung

One who eats beef by slaughtering underage calf is NOT the same as one who eats beef of buffallows. 




The above write up a anti semitic and calls for voliance upon bhramins, just like the naxzis do and continue to do so. 




The tax paying citizen [ net + ve tax paying [ no reservation, no govt aided college and medicare ] ] is an asset, not a libilaity. [removed] Ambedkar also wrote about it in one of his books To clarify I am not against vegetarianism itself, it is actually a good thing but it is not good to force it upon poor Indians who have historically suffered great injustices and many still do. If you can afford to chose what you want to eat, that’s great but remember not everyone is able to chose. very true Unfortunately, in Hinduism, certain animals are considered more valuable than certain categories of humans. gohatya or slaughter of cows is a grave sin, perhaps only superseded by brahmahatya  or killing of Brahmins. Why are you replying to your own post.You can edit it. They say that non veg makes your mind dull (which is complete bs btw), to them, I say, Einstein and Newton weren't vegetarians.. I agree with your heading. In India vegetarianism is like that. But you are going too much extreme on other side and getting preachy . Let people eat whatever they want. This post reminds me of the L. K. Advani interview with his wife, where she blurted out that his favourite food was chicken hearing this Advani was visibly perturbed/embarassed and negging her to shut up. > ""People who committed big sins in past life, have been forbidden to enjoy tasty (non-veg) food in this life""

I use this to shut down any vegetarian who pretends to be morally superior as I much on my chicken/fish/beef/pork :) Bang on!

You forgot the main aspect that connects the caste system and diet - untouchability! 

I get people getting nauseated due to the smell. But there's whole different untouchability I have witnessed where the vegetarians don't want people eating non veg on same table to touch their food or even use same spoons. As if some minute particles of non veg are gonna spoil their purity.

And another mistake we do is restricting this discussion to Brahmins. The Jains are vociferously pungent about non vegetarians. Most of the shit non vegetarians receive comes from them! I sometimes wonder how every discussion somehow excludes the nasty practices of that community. I felt very much in two minds when I visited India as a vegetarian (vegetarian for ethical reasons). I was of course absolutely delighted to have so many options when it came to food, and it never felt like the food I had was prepared as an afterthought. In Western countries, you're sometimes lucky if there is one vegetarian option on a restaurant's menu, and that itself will often be ""Please ask your waiter"". This roughly translate as ""Ask us, and we'll go through the back of the fridge and maybe the peels from yesterday, fry up what we find, throw some soy sauce over it and sell it to you as stir-fry for €20"". So having so many choices and such delicious options was a fantastic experience for me.

However, when I chatted with my colleagues while there, I had more than one of them mention to me how some of their family members would use their vegetarianism almost like a weapon. One told me that he and his wife were no longer vegetarian, and consequently her parents had cut contact for years. Even after they had re-established contact, they would not set foot into the non-veg couples house for a long time. They now do come and visit, but the couple have to ""cleanse"" the house before the parents arrive, to make sure that there is no meat in the house at all. Not even powdered chicken stock. And no eggs in the fridge, either.

Another told me that an aunt of hers, when going out with the rest of the family to eat at a restaurant, will bring her own food. And she's only started doing that after not having had a meal with her family for years.

It really made me sad to hear about all this. Sharing food is such an important aspect of companionship, family and culture, and to break that so callously and brutally is beyond my comprehension. I really appreciate this post. It actually came up recently in another thread I was in. I like that you wrote this without criticising any one section. Vegetarianism in India is one of the great plagues forced upon the masses. If we could eat beef and pork and other meat then we would never go hungry. The Chinese eat everything, learn from them. They have survived some of the worst famines in history yet they are thriving PETA, celebrities and Westerners need to stop endorsing vegetarianism (and even worse, veganism) in a developing 3rd world country where most of the people suffer from hunger. It makes me sick when Westerners praise Indians for their non-violent vegetarianism. Sure, Indians can’t hurt cows but they have no issue lynching a human that supposedly ate one Fantastic points put forward. Vegetarianism is form of elitist thinking and lifestyle and it's also repressive. Live and let live, and let people eat what they want ffs. Ugh!
And the virtue signaling in social media.
Every single time when there is a forest fire, this same group couldn't stop posting about meat industry's 3% contribution to global warming.

I'm like.. 
Yeah? The forests stop burning if malnutrition becomes the global standard?

You don't eat meat because of your fucking scriptures you idiot, don't pretend like you care about the planet.

The same people do not care about anything else that is happening in India! [deleted] If you replace that vegetarianism with English language in India and non vegetarianism with the desi languages we will reach the same conclusion , the thing is poor people always follow the rich people not the other way around Root cause is not caste hierarchy. Root cause is some principle behind a caste not wanting to consume meat. It's a stupid argument, comparing caste hierarchy to love for animals. You should rather compare the reason why certain castes want to follow vegetarianism. I wonder when people of kolkata are forced to try Jain/Marwadi Veg food Are you against animal agriculture or for it? I would like to make a new post now because at this point there are too many comments to reply individually so apologies for this. Also thanks for the silver!

Ok so title states that Indian vegetarianism has more to do with caste hierarchy than love for animals. That does not mean caste system is the reason for vegetarianism. I apologise if at any time I made it appear that way. Religion, region and availability of ingredients as well as economics are also very important factors 

I also apologise for hurting sentiments of anyone, in no way do I mock anyone for holding cow sacred, but the truth is that cows in India are sadly not thriving, most as seen on the road side are actually struggling to survive. We can argue that at least they are free unlike other countries where they are kept in poor welfare farms and abused for meat and dairy etc.

I am not against any community or caste, I am merely against discrimination, a lot of which is so deeply rooted in our society that we have been blinded to a large extent. I believe people should be able to eat what they want

The reason I posted parts of this article from 2017 is because it is still valid and the whole thing has some unnecessary details, otherwise I could have just posted a link to the original. I elaborated my own views and opinion in the comments 

As we can see society is changing and attitudes, not always for the better unfortunately 

Being Vegetarian is good but eating meat is not bad. Yes vegetarianism nowadays will benefit the environment but it not be forced on anyone. The poorest of the poor should have the right a balanced proper diet. They have historically eaten meat so it is unfair to take that away from them as well and advocate them to eat plant based substitutes, so much has already been taken away from them.

Peace and prosperity 

Bharat mata ki jai! Can anyone tell why specifically cow was chosen to be revered and not buffalo? I don't think this is a sound model considering that the fraction of meat eaters don't follow the caste hierarchy, I mean if Caste Hierarchy is Brahmins > Kshatriyas > Vaishyas > Shudras, then going by your explanation the fraction of meat eaters should be in the order of Shudras > Vaishyas > Kshatriyas > Brahmins, but it's more like Shudras > Kshatriyas > Brahmins > Vaishyas. I have seen a lower number of Baniya caste people who are non-vegetarians as compared to Brahmins.

Plus eating meat is more like function of how religious someone is (if meat eating is forbidden in the version of religion in their region), behavioral inertia, and economic situation. Expanding on the last one, Dalits of my village are pretty well to do, I mean you wouldn't notice when you enter lower caste neighborhood, so eating meat for them is not a matter of survival, and behavioral inertia and religious beliefs take over.    

Also I don't think we should be discussing this, because it is implicitly persuading people to eat meat. Currently nearly all meat is industrially produced which results in great suffering for the animals involved, is bad for health and have massive environmental impact. Beef is worst of all, especially the cattle reared solely for slaughter. 

A cow needs to be fed 20+ tons of food and even greater amount of water before it's ready for slaughter in two years, in the meantime it has produced 10s of tons of methane and carbon dioxide. Then you kill it to obtain a few hundred kilograms of meat. This is horrible conversion ratio of resources.  

We have raised cattle for generations, so take it from me that you need at least half acre land to support one cow. Now on one hand you ear mark half acre for two years and then you will get say 300 kg of meat, or you could grow 8 different crops in the meantime which will give you much greater amount of food products, and capture some CO2 in the meantime. I don’t see it as such a problem in Punjab. I suppose it’s because caste hierarchy isn’t as big of an issue as it is in other states. It’s an issue but not as prominent I think.

For **TLDR** scroll to the bottom of the comment (PART 2).

\-------

Vegetarianism is the natural course any civilization would follow in a country with the geographical conditions such as India's. And vegetarianism as a cultural phenomenon (religion, caste, etc.) is merely a consequence.

Let me explain this.

We have one of the most fertile plains in the world, created due to the the extensive river network throughout the subcontinent, the most prominent ones being the Indus river plains and the Ganga river plains (630 million acres) ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Gangetic\_Plain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Gangetic_Plain))

For the climate that early Indians were exposed to, the terrain and the geographical conditions they lived in, agriculture was the most optimal means to feed the society. As a side note, agriculture and relative isolation is the main reason for such explosive population. The conditions were similar for china too. (This research paper illustrates the correlation between agriculture and explosive population growth ([https://www.nature.com/articles/16339](https://www.nature.com/articles/16339))

Now compare this with China.

China, like India has an extensive river network throughout the early Chinese civilization positioned on the east of Heihe-Tengchong line, where to this day, 94% of the population resides. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heihe%E2%80%93Tengchong\_Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heihe%E2%80%93Tengchong_Line))

China also has two prominent rivers, namely, Yellow river and the Yangtze river, which led to a network of multiple fertile plains, the most prominent being northeastern Chinese plain. This is also where the earliest Chinese civilization existed ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast\_China\_Plain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_China_Plain)) ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow\_River\_civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_River_civilization))

Agriculture, like in India, was naturally adopted in China too, given the climatic, geographical conditions of the country. This again lead to the explosive population growth in China, like in India. ([https://www.nature.com/articles/16339](https://www.nature.com/articles/16339))

Now, let's analyze the vegetarianism aspect of this situation.

Like India, China also had a long history of vegetarianism, mainly due to the agricultural development the civilization witnessed (This later changed, people did eat ""weird $hit""; Mongols have a significant contribution to meat eating culture in China, again, due to Mongolian geography). ([https://ivu.org/history/east/china.html](https://ivu.org/history/east/china.html)) Huan Tsang also notes that Indian upper castes were predominantly vegetarian. ([https://www.ibiblio.org/britishraj/Jackson9/chapter03.html](https://www.ibiblio.org/britishraj/Jackson9/chapter03.html))

Comparing this to non-agricultural civilizations (more appropriately, settlements and nomads) found mainly in central, western Asia, Europe and Mid-Africa, where agriculture was difficult, people resorted to meat consumption. The first meat production/culturing (NOT consumption; early Homo sapiens ate meat too but they weren't civilized yet) took place in western Asia, which then spread to central Asia and Europe. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat#History\_of\_meat\_production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat#History_of_meat_production))

Not only India and China, most ancient agricultural civilizations like East (China, Japan), South East, Mediterranean basin adopted vegetarianism. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History\_of\_vegetarianism#Ancient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_vegetarianism#Ancient))

If you look at the terminology we use

Pure veg 

Non-veg

These are unique to India

Pure veg apparently does not even include onions and garlic and masoor dal as well as mushrooms and more. It is basically the Sattvik diet. It includes yoghurt, milk, ghee, butter. Sometimes vegan tourists mistake pure veg for vegan but that is not the case. Pure veg is for the purest castes

Non-veg is unique to India because vegetarian is not considered the norm in other countries thus the term is not used. ‘Meat’ or protein is used instead Everything I have said is true. People downvoting my comments on this thread are either bigoted/prejudiced or content with ignorance and want to keep the lower castes oppressed [removed] I call this BS.I come from a vegetarian family, been one my whole life. Never witnessed any caste or religion based discrimination. India is too big for such broad generalizations, I can speak for North Indians (Punjabis, including Delhi) are mostly vegetarians and also the most cosmopolitan of Hindus and have the least level of discrimination based on caste, religion or race. I have second hand knowledge for rest of India, still the love, respect and acceptance of animals in India is impressive and admirable.

Whatever the reason may be how Hindus arrived to this but Vegetarianism is the future and the way to go. Vegetarianism and respect for all lives is only increasing in the world, it is actually one of the most important strategies to manage climate change and its impact. I know about 100+ vegetarians, except for the handful religious nutjobs, nobody cares about caste or ""purity"". 

Most vegetarians do not want meat because of the eek factor, the smell or death, the whole idea of boiling dead bodies and eating flesh is insane, disgusting and most importantly extremely disturbing. 

Would you be comfortable if dog meat was introduced in schools ?"

As we all know, WhatsApp is a major source of disinformation in our country. To help mitigate this, I've created a bot that crowdsources information on fake WhatsApp forwards. It works with text, photos, videos, audio clips, etc.

Wanna try it out? **Send any fake forwards that you have received to +14704378045** (over WhatsApp). Please encourage any gullible friends you might have to try it too.

It's a little bit volatile at the moment (blame Facebook for making automation difficult) and goes down from time to time. Please be patient if this happens, it is scheduled to restart at 5:30 am IST everyday.

Comments and suggestions welcome.

Edit 2:
Many people are asking how the bot stops fake news, so I'm copy pasting my explanation here -

There are two main scenarios:

1. You receive a WhatsApp forward which you know is factually fake and want to report it. You can forward the message to this bot and report it as fake, and leave a note as to why you think it's fake.

2. You receive a WhatsApp forward and want to check if it's genuine before believing it/passing it on. You can forward it to the bot, and the bot will inform you how many people have reported it as fake and their reasons for doing so

Full video of the hearing and the vote that followed.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eykwsp/seattle_city_council_becomes_the_first_us/,"This resolution was tabled on January 21st because some of the council members thought they needed to do more research after receiving an email from the Council General of India. 

It was scheduled for a hearing and vote at 2pm today. It has been a long and emotional day. There were around 200-300 people supporting the resolution and probably not more than 80 who were supporting CAA and against the resolution. They were in minority but were the loudest and were there at the city hall since 7 in the morning. Since they were first in line, they got to register for the hearing first and got the opportunity to speak. [Here is the full video of the hearing and the vote.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwygRQ6oXuQ)

One after the other they came and spoke lies about how CAA has nothing to do with Indians. They talked about how minorities are being prosecuted in Pakistan/Bangladesh, how women are being forcefully converted or raped in these countries, or how minorities went from 25% to 5% in these countries(without any source for that information). Some argued that Seattle should deal with its own problems of homelessness, drugs and crime instead of ""falling prey to hate-mongering"". One person even claimed that there is a [genocide of Hindus going on in India and the population of Hindus went down to 65%.](https://youtu.be/WwygRQ6oXuQ?t=1920) Many people laughed at that. Some accused the council member Kshama Sawant and her political aspirations and her ""ulterior motives"" behind this resolution. Some even went on to claim that all these protests against CAA are sponsored by Pakistan/ISI. [And when there was finally a group to speak in favor of the resolution, the bhakts started heckling and shouting at them and the the hearing was suspended,](https://youtu.be/WwygRQ6oXuQ?t=2798) which they knew would happen. When the hearing was resumed it was back to them and their lies.

After the public hearing, the council member Sawant [gave an amazing speech supporting the resolution](https://youtu.be/WwygRQ6oXuQ?t=4463) and she was constantly being heckled. And then there was [this](https://youtu.be/WwygRQ6oXuQ?t=5106) comment from another council member who could see the bigotry through all the comments made by the bhakts.

In the end, truth prevailed and the council members voted 5 out of 5 in favor of the resolution. 

Right when it was apparent that the resolution was going to be passed, the bhakts started [creating a ruckus](https://youtu.be/WwygRQ6oXuQ?t=5574) and after multiple warnings, security was called and they were asked to leave the hall.

Good job for chronicling all this, OP. With bhakts, it's painfully evident that while they feel greatly for the persecuted minorities, their hatred for Muslims is much more in magnitude. A bhakt who is truly for the persecuted Hindu minority would have suggested inclusion of all religions so that relief for persecuted Hindus is expedited in the light of the protests. Of course BJPs doesn't give two shits about the persecuted Hindus. Their endgame is mostly WB polls where they stand to immensely gain if the Muslim illegals are disenfranchised ( who currently are part of the Mamta vote bank) UN should pass a resolution against CAA NRC. Impose sanctions, if required. Whatever it takes  the spirit of India must be saved. Nice to see the council focused on the real issues of the city. Always wondered why shit never got done in Seattle... thanks. Hasn't US, France and Israel supported CAA or my Facebook feed is broken?

They are just hacking the democratic processes and have misplaced loyalties. I want to see one passed against China. Bunch of hypocrites. It's like saying 'happy mahoram' to a Muslim.

293,Scheduled,Can Indians grow a spine already?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f2y883/can_indians_grow_a_spine_already/,"I am so sick of Indian men and women being pressured into arranged marriages. I am sick of the whole virginity being the sacred bowl of purity, sick of aunties who will keep on nagging you to get married. This is absurd. 

Everyone puts up the whole, 'Arranged marriages are done with consent' bs. Are they though? Deep inside everyone knows that the majority of the Indian population is pressured into marriage. 

Let's see, if someone pressures you to have sex, it is *sexual assault*, right? It is a crime. You shouldn't be pressured into *anything*, not even marriage. I can't believe how manipulative parents can get, 'I will slit my wrists if you don't get married', 'You will see my dead face if you don't get married'. Here's the thing, taking your own life needs a *lot of courage*, trust me, I have tried. *Your parents won't take their own lives for this*. You are an adult, probably earning, you can take care of yourself and take your own decisions. *Please don't be pressured and ruin two lives*, hell maybe 3 lives, if we assume that you will have a child. I am from a dysfunctional family, arranged marriage, of course, and my life has been hell. I remember wishing that my parents never got married, even if it resulted in me not being in this world. 

Here's the thing, life's already complicated, you need to earn, do your job, take care of yourself and others, etc, why make life more difficult with things that don't need to be complicated. Socialize, date, make friends, find common interests, know each other for *years*, marry. That's how biology of the body is. 

Some say that arranged marriages have a courtship period, but how long does it last? The maximum amount of time I have seen someone just being engaged in an arranged marriage is 1 year. Not to mention, the courtships can be in an controlled environment and fixed meeting and schedules. How can you be sure your partner wants to marry? Hell, how can you be sure? Is it because *this is just the next step*? What if your sexual libidos, kinks don't match?
 I, for a fact know that I won't marry someone until I have know them for atleast 3 years! It's sad to see where the society is going. You can say that that's how the culture of India is, but does the culture have any value if it suppresses and unnaturalizes the whole concept of love and relationships, the way biology works? If it affects mental health? After all, isn't culture just man-made? Only the positive aspects of culture should be kept. Relationships, sex, love are natural. Nothing *sacred*. If you want arrange marriage, good for you, just make sure your partner has *actually consented*.

Sincerely, a rant by me. Seeing my dear best friend in depression after being emotionally blackmailed into a marriage with same threats of suicide, 'log kya kahenge', etc has been terrible. Know that parents are not Gods, they are humans whom you should definitely respect but they *do* make mistakes. Even if love marriage doesn't work, you have yourself to blame, not your parents and part in your own terms. If you are pressured into a marriage, how can you say that you won't be pressured to no divorce? 

Stand up for yourself.

Edit: This is amusing. I would like to point out few things,

1) I am not claiming that *all* arranged marriages are forced. I have just stated how forced marriages do happen. Some people have taken it personally.  *I just feel it is projection*.
2) Many people are denying this, but it happens. A lot. To the point that it is so normalized that you don't feel it. *This is not a village thing. The friend I mentioned is from Mumbai*.
3) The ""I am a virgin, I want a virgin"". Okay, good for you, it's just, I feel that you are insecure about yourself. Atleast, that's how it looks like to me, as  a girl. (Oh, I am a *virgin* girl, so don't come at spewing shit like, ""You had sex that's why you don't want virginity to be considered""). If not, tell me why your partner's virginity matters to you, if it's not insecurity. It's a preference? Well, why is it? I mean, given the trend in the comments, most of you want to marry for sex. Which defiles marriage in itself, which you claim is sacred.
4) if calling me names, saying I am a weak shit for pointing out the obvious things happening in the society *and denying that it happens* makes you feel better, well, you do you. Classic ad hominem. Oh, you can say that I am generalising, and you know what, maybe I am, because generalizations always have a bit of truth of the society in them.
5) ""I won't get a good looking girl if I don't have an arranged marriage"". Oh my, that is so shallow. Just like a girl asking for 6 figures is wrong, then so is you asking for a good looking girl. Don't cry foul that women want money and gold diggers when you are just as shallow as them. I guess the quote should go, 'Don't judge a person until it's time for marriage'.
6) MARRIAGE IS NOT A CONTRACT AND DEFINITELY NOT A PASS FOR SEX. If you are marrying just for sex,   you are pitiful. Screams lack of confidence in yourself. People need to work on themselves, you don't get things you want just by sitting and hoping to get it. Since, most arguments are from men here, I have noticed that they are happy that they don't have to do anything and their parents get them a bride and sex while the bride gets 'financial security'. Reminds me of how you have to pay a prostitute to get sex, except here, it has a better name. 

Again, I would like to clear that I am against 'forced arranged marriages', though I am not a huge fan of the business like transaction of arranged marriages, what people want is none of concern. People have started bashing it as if I am totally against arranged marriage. Though, I have tried to counter the points which have been posted in defense of arranged marriage (and I didn't find them convincing). Though most of them argue about how arranged marriages are not bad, which I agree. *It's just how it happens here, is bad*. And I have tried to counter them too, though those have no relation to the whole point of the post. Which is how many are being forced into marriage and how it is so normalized in the present society.

Oof, formatting in reddit sucks. And I have realized that India has a *long, long* way to go. 

*Pretty ironic. A country in which romantic movies are usually the highest grossing, shuns love in real life.*

I am not going to reply anymore, I have tried to reply to every comment but now it has become exhausting. Have a nice day, everyone."," I think bigger underlying issue is the idea of life isn't complete or you are not settled till the time you are married. I could be earning, financially and emotionally independent but for Indian parents marriage is end all be all to every existence. More urban parents are getting sort of okay with love or ""love-arranged"" but none is okay with idea of NO marriage. 
And standing up to them is like death with thousand cuts. It starts eroding your conscience.  arranged marriages give way to dysfunctional families but I have seen non arranged marriages being dysfunctional as well. As dysfunctional people attract each other that type of thing. #The average guys *wishes* he would find love. Counterpoint: Dating in India is dominated by players, scammers, blackmailers and entitled ones who throw acid if they dont get what they want. There is no place for civility here.

tl;dr: Dating in India is asking for trouble. [deleted] Arranged marriages are the only reason why some men in our country get a woman to marry them. Yeah, grow a spine and like and do as one likes. There is no need that only 1 way is correct.

&#x200B;

I went for arranged marriage as there are many factors in place for me.  If one loves someone he can do love marriage, some one likes live-in. Do it.

&#x200B;

In any case, anything can happen. People get depressed after love marriage also.

&#x200B;

And I personally don't think that it's the case of who one can blame after things go south. . Becoming an adult means that you can make a decision and you have to live with it. Dating is risky in india..only safe dating options are in college or workplace. Lot of scamners out there. Arranged marriage is the only route  for people not finding a match at these places..these days most profiles on matrimonial sites are managed by girls only so i dont see how it is any different from any other dating app.regarding courtship  3 years is a bit too much time to understand and then reject a person especially if you are nearing your 30s. Most Indian guys lack the social skills and/or social capital to get into relationships. There's also the skewed ratio at work here, coupled with the fact that girls are highly and in some cases violently discouraged from being in relationships. I'd say it's a cultural flaw - arranged marriages have been the norm for centuries, we never developed the social skills to maintain romantic relationships before marriage. The majority, which either doesn't know how to talk to the opposite sex, or can't, has only one chance at a relationship - through Arranged Marriage. Which is a hit or miss, with no way to undo what has been done. Can Indians grow a spine, or do you lack the said object yourself op? Seems like a big whine. 
If you have a problem with arranged marriages, just don't do one. People don't usually date in small towns and villages. And they have their right to remain a virgin before marriage.

And yes it's your friend here who has to grow a spine and stand up for himself. Marriage is not compulsory. Only if you find a person worth living with, all your life. Totally agree.  Way too many idiots  in our country who haven't really grown up into independent men and women. The arranged marriages is merely a systemic escapism from having to make hard and tough decisions by themselves. Its the classic outsourcing strategy. [removed] Counter point : Arranged marriage gives an average looking (ugly) desi guy (who invested in academics) a shot at getting a decent looking girl. 

Love is all emotional stuff but getting ""arranged married"" is a transaction \>   I have noticed that they are happy that they don't have to do anything  and their parents get them a bride and sex while the bride gets  'financial security'. Reminds me of how you have to pay a prostitute to  get sex, except here, it has a better name

While *Forced Marriages* are obviously bad ,the idea of confused shy young guys getting a bride by their parents for sexual gratification might seem selfish initially ,there's a lot of good things that happen as a consequence if the bride and groom consent since both achieve sexual gratification which is necessary at a young age and most people in India cannot find partners through love marriages since it isn't in our culture.

Also it makes certain youngsters both boys and girls responsible and gives them direction.I'm not even saying that only the husband works . Both may work and raise children together.

Its not a perfect process and there will be  disagreements when the going gets tough,that's why consent of both is so important. With consent the marriage is more likely to be successful than a love marriage since they've already made a decision before marriage to live their life with a person without rose tinted glasses  so they've (ideally) seen things which lovers wouldn't have or tend to ignore

\>  Oof, formatting in reddit sucks

In mobile . Not on PC

\>  *A country in which romantic movies are usually the highest grossing, shuns love in real life*

Not necessarily if you consider the amount of love marriages in this environment.

Plus look at the number of inter caste and inter religious marriages in the time of open bigotry

And I have realized that India has a *long, long* way to go

There are genuine problems with how arranged marriages are done in the subcontinent

The caste factor,skin color ,dowry and business and family relationships (groom and bride) often overtake actual marriage requirements of the boy or girl. This is a social evil and transcends every religion Of course they can not. They have a 'Good Guy' image to maintain, which usually translates to just obeying your parents blindly and staying away from unpopular opinions! Shit is engraved so deep, the practitioner doesn't get a whiff of it, irrespective of how smelly it is. People who are being forced into arrange marriage do need to step up. But if the person in picture is not against then everything is alright. who is this clown to say one year isn't enough just because he takes 3 years to decide? My way IS RIGHT NOT YOURS HURR DURR!! Yeah, obviously you know people better. Everyone around is simply being assaulted all the time, forced into arranged marriages and they have no say in it.

Seriously, where do such notions even come from? Have you tried talking to people around you? Most young couples I see in arranged marriages have had their wishes respected and are perfectly happy with their partner. It is only in the villages and in some families with issues where forced marriages happen.

Not every arranged marriage is forced marriage and harboring an opinion like makes you a cultural bigot. A strong disagree here.  I think one has to be realistic and practical about this. Op probably has an environment where everyone dates for years before marriage. Personally, if a young bloke asks me for advice on thks, I'd simply tell him that if they are already in a (physical) relationship with a woman and they like them, marry them by all means as and when they mutually agree. But if the chances of winding up with a gf are bleak (either because of lack of opportunity in a skewed gender environment or lack of a non-ugly face) , then LISTEN to the damn aunty and get arranged marriage once you have a job. In the hope for a Bollywood like romance, watching yourself become the third, fifth ... (2k+1)th wheel over time  will only kill you from the inside.  
And things like ""sexual compatibility"" are first world problems. It's when people are already getting a lot of action and want to optimize it. For a common Indian bloke, any bandhi is better than his right hand. 
I used to be like you: woke and arranged marriage basher during my younger years. But I've come to realize that idealism has its limits. In the end, in life, the rules are set and everyone plays by them. >virginity being sacred bowl of purity

A virgin would prefer a virgin partner. Nothing wrong with that. Those who've lost the V-card are free to ask for a partner ""*who knows what to do in bed*"".

Also, arrange marriage helps people get laid at least. A guy with a good future and a girl with a clean past get the most out of this system. That's the reality. 

Bring in the downvotes. At last someone spoke on the reddit what I usually keep saying to my friends. Exactly! The whole system is so rotten that it has no value left. [deleted] Good rant..
It's not as black and white as we would like it to be...some people are happy after an arranged marriage...so be it...

Both sides win.. Move out the minute you start earning and don't look back. Raise a good family (or not) on your terms. Unfuck the ""culture"". This is the only solution. It's a social issue. It's not really limited to family level. It's not even a marriage. It's a transaction. Beauty/wealth is exchanged for wealth. It's all about matching standards. It's a shitshow to be frank. The courtship posts are funny af. I live in a state which has one of the highest suicide rates among youths. We don't have the normal Dalit, Hindu, Muslim communities but even in our indigenous communities inter-cast marriages are looked down upon. I've lost 2 friends and a relative who were being pressured to marry someone they didn't like or had been separated from the person they eloped with by the families.

The seperations are normally aided by the police but it has to be done since most(ones I've witnessed in my locality) cases the lovers are not at the age recommend for marriage. India also needs to rid itself of the caste system. The biggest blockbuster next to Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge was Hum Aapke Hai...Kaun?. Around 80% of the movie was an Indian arranged marriage process from scratch. It is a Dummy #101 sort of thing if anyone wanna research. Then the rest 20% of it includes, pregnancy news, baby shower big party and baby welcoming bigger party, the wife gets killed off, husband set to marry his sister in law so she can take care of her deceased sister's baby. But in the end love conquers all when a Pomeranian dog spills the beans about secret relationship between husband's brother and the said sister in law. Happy ending, now love cum arranged marriage process begins.

Most of the parents you have today have come from those era and put a trademark that this is how marriages must happen. It has nothing to do with relationships, it's just how big of a wedding ceremony it was for a family. How much jewellery the bride wore, how many hours she spent on make up and dressing, did the groom threw a lavish Haldi party (usually means booze, chicken and dance), how big of a tent was created, etc etc. Every Indian parents see that future for their children and feed this idea into them. They don't teach them since young how to look out for yourself, what you should seek or how to lead your own self. They just teach their kids how to be like them in the marriage. And that's not always a pleasant thing to observe till you grow up. It is so sad that people are being forced into this ""normal life""

I've seen a lot of people get married or engaged recently and its mostly a really unhappy affair for them. I also have older friends in their 30s and 40s and most of these unhappy marriages will turn into divorce or infidelity, like they have right now.

Parents are only concerned with what the society will think/say. Thankfully I've convinced my parents that marriage is my choice and they have no role to play in the decision and they've backed off although the taunts do come sometimes. Still it needs to be forever remembered that it is my life and my decision. Fuck the world and fuck the society. Years of patriarchy and female infanticide has left us with a skewed gender ratio.

This skew gets  progressively worse as you go up the education ladder, since ""zyada padh likh legi to isse shaadi kaun karega"". So its not like the urban educated working class is spread out in an equal ratio and they should just pick a match for themselves - the ratio is badly skewed, something like an 80-20. This works great for the 20 girls who were fortunate enough to have progressive parents, since now they have a pool of 80 guys to pick from.

But the remaining 60 guys have no options in their peer groups or circles. So they get matched with Tier 2 Tier 3 city girls through this system of ""Arranged Marriage"" simply because there is no way they would cross paths with these girls without the intervention of relatives who work as ""arrangers"" in the arranged marriage system.

Lets not jump the gun and vilify the institution of arranged marriage, we need to focus on and eliminate this deeprooted patriarchy from our society to enable more women to get out and study/work and that financial independence goes a long way towards your parent's acceptance of your decisions about your own life.

If guys and girls were out and about in equal numbers, hardly any matches would need to be fixed by family members. they would have time and opportunity to find the right match and evaluate his/her marriage potential on their own.

Also a lot of the onus lies on you and me. Our parents are so used to having their way when it comes to our life choices that they just assume it is their right to decide our future here aswell. Stand up for yourself a little earlier in life, start taking decisions for yourself, learn to say no. Not just for the heck of it, but where it actually matters.

And besides, I do not know anyone who REALLY wanted to marry someone give up on the relationship because of parental pressure - all the quitters you see around you are just people who were on the fence about it and use parental pressure as an excuse. If you DO NOT want to get married, nobody can get you married (barring some extreme cases where the family's psychotic). If you give in to emotional drama then you are yourself to blame. Marriage is a crap shoot irrespective of whether it is a love marriage or not. It's lottery of life.... Laughs in naati and pota Laughs in die alone. I know I'm not gonna get anyone to like me, let alone that love bs and that is why I don't want to get married. I hope my parents will understand. > I am from a dysfunctional family, arranged marriage, of course

I never though i'd use the fake internet currency to award someone, but take it, this post deserves it.

I too come from same bg as you. On the good side, my parents are individually honest and good people at heart, but together they make a horrendenous couple.

There is 0 understanding, 100% dominance, 0 romance. My mom avoids going out with father, we don't have outings and have total **0** movies watched together. I cant remember the last time we dined together, or had a conversation together. I'm not on good terms with dad, so we avoid eye contact or talk unless absolutely necessary.

Don't get me wrong, my mom loves my dad and dad loves mom but only because its their responsibility and were forced into marriage. They are just like your father and mother, caring, loving, sacrificing, but as a couple, as a family, I would have preferred them divorced.

There is a myth we see in movies that after arranged marriage, as time passes, everything settles down, in our case it didn't. It only got worse.

It affected me so much that I, at a fundamental level don't understand or feel anything family related. Moms bday ?? cool, idc. Anniversary? idc. Somebody's wedding and if I dnt attend they'd cut ties off ? cool, idc.

I hope I'm explaining it correctly, but remember the feeling you get when its a special day for your loved ones ? maybe its their bday or they got a promotion ? the happiness you feel ? I just don't get it regarding family.

People think I do it for attention and they find it literally impossible to comprehend that a son could not feel anything for family. I don't give any explanation and it translates for them into 'edgy wannabe guy'.

The saddest part I felt was, My grandmother, with whom I lived from 1st to 10th because parents left in morning and came at night, when she died. I held her in my arms and I felt **nothing**. I was more petrified by the feeling that 'why am I not crying, why am I not feeling sad?' it was like a strangers death for me.

The second time where I considered counselling is when my dog of 12 years died in my arms (he was already sick) I was with him during his last moments checking for heartbeat. He left this world, and I did not feel sad. I was again feeling petrified over not feeling anything, it was just like a strangers death.

This is how my family fuckup has made me. If not for my close friends and exes and current gf, I dunno where I would have been. ties to family here are very strong and parents want to be part of their children’s lives compared to the west, where you get complete freedom to do whatever you want. So obviously they want “best” for their kids which includes finding a paramour.
That usually means finding someone that’s socially acceptable to them and their own family on parameters such as caste, status, features, reputation, etc.
It never includes anything that you may desire so shut up and get married or carve your own way in life with no one to question you. Ah you echoed my thoughts because I am going through it. I am turning 27 in May and my parents are losing their shit, that I have to marry ASAP, but I have complete clarity in my mind that I won't marry a stranger. I have indicated to my family that I would want to marry someone I know well enough, but the problem is that I am not dating anyone so that option can't be exercised either. 


The thing going my way is that I pay mine and family's bills, and I will have to more or less pay for my own wedding, so they can only pressurize, not force, and I have a pretty good spine lol. Very true,I am 27 and being a secret agnostic/atheist from few years I always get the thought of why we need to get married and have kids, are we so dumb that knowing how much struggles we face days to day and still we give birth to a kid and expect them to get over it in future.

294,Scheduled,Scheduled my first counselling session with Psychologist. What should I keep in mind and what should I expect to get out of it?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b6i7k0/scheduled_my_first_counselling_session_with/,"Hi people,

&#x200B;

I just scheduled my first counselling session after 5 years of running away from depression, anxiety and SAD. I feel a bit anxious about it and don't have any knowledge about how these things go?

&#x200B;

What am I expected to share? What to expect from the professional? What information to withhold? Is it really like what is shown in Western cinema and telly?

&#x200B;

Any help is really appreciated."," Tell them what you feel., try and understand the trigger points.. As someone battling SAD and depression id recommend you go to a psychiatrist instead. Psychologists can't prescribe meds and I feel meds (not anti depressants or sedatives) can improve the condition a great deal.  And in my opinion meds should be the first linen of treatment.

Having said that, psychologists can offer CBT which can also help SAD and other mental afflictions. I would suggest seeking both treatments but if that's overwhelming then please consider going to a psychiatrist first Just be completely honest with them.
Don't worry about any judgement or such things  Be honest and speak what you feel your perspective etc. If they want to give you tablets ask them if you can be treated without it .
All the best 🙂 Type your life story so far on a page and hand it over to the psych\*ist. They can read it and gain an initial understanding better this way. Good conversation kickstarter instead of ""Tell Me About Yourself"" kind-of open ended vagueness. It's not a sprint, it's a marathon. Don't worry if you don't see any difference in the first session.

How will the Indian government know whether the applicant has lied in the document or not? Are they going to take a Bangladeshi or a Pakistani at face value? Itna bharosa?

Has anyone ever directly benefited by the scheme? Funny, FAQ Q18 reads as 'since a large number of requests are received seeking financial assistance for medical treatment, it is not possible to accommodate all requests due to limited resources.'
Limited resources? They had 570.68 crores in surplus from just one year? 
Also it is mentioned that the balance amount(which are significant surplus since 2011-12) is ""invested"" in various forms with scheduled banks and other agencies to ensure long term sustainability. So, about 75% of last year's funds are ""invested""?

297,Scheduled,TIFU by being from a Scheduled Caste but apparently not looking like one,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7jhqsa/tifu_by_being_from_a_scheduled_caste_but/,"Sorry for the dramatic title. Also as TIFUs usually go, this did not happen today but over a period of a month

A little background, I'm a 27 year old male, IIM passout. working in a well known consulting firm earning about 30LPA. I am a sincere, hardworking, simple dude. Since most caste related discussions always end up about reservation, lemme clarify that I never used it. Got 99.4 %ile in CAT, also had got AIR in 600's general in IITJEE. But here's the catch, despite being a Telugu SC, apparently I don't look like one. I am light-skinned and have good facial features I guess.

So I figured I was ready to get married. Since I had no luck on Tinder and was extremely busy to go out and find someone, I created a profile on one of those matrimony websites for professionals because I want an educated, broad-minded working wife. MISTAKE #1. Most of the profiles on there were of girls from highly educated backgrounds and thats the reason I thought I could find someone like me whom I could connect with in terms of principles, attitude toward education/work/life, my agnostic beliefs etc.

I checked the 'Any' option on caste as it doesn't matter to me and figured since this is a place for educated professionals, nobody really cares about caste. MISTAKE #2.

So within a week, I get a fair amount of matches. Some are handled by parents, some handled by the girls themselves. Here are some interesting experiences I had over a period of a month:

1) **Telugu Unkil**: Caste mentioned - Kapu. Says he is ""highly interested"" in my profile. I mail him back saying if he has any caste preferences and that I prefer open-minded people in general. Writes back saying how his daughter is very broad-minded, hates traditional mindset and they are looking for a very liberal family. I think great, I would like to know more about her and we started talking on whatsapp and we seem to hit it off pretty well. 5 days later she asks me my caste and I mention it. Ghosted. No replies, she unfriends me on facebook, blocks me on whatsapp. I move on.


2) **Gril**: Works for a big bank in Mumbai. Mentions 'Any' caste. So I think great. I message her and she accepts it. We exchange numbers and start talking. A week goes by, we have talked about our jobs, future plans, location preferences and want to schedule a personal meetup. She messages me - ""hey I think you should know this, I am from Teli caste which is OBC. Hope your parents are ok?"" I tell her I don't care and neither do my parents. Then I tell her about my caste, and she starts acting weird. Starts replying to my texts in syllables and tries to hang up on my calls. I feel bad and message her asking what ticked her off. She says that she thought I was from an upper caste and that's why she replied to my message. And now she doesn't want to proceed any further and want to cancel all further plans. I told her that it's a bit hypocritical of her that initially she was one wanting my parents to be ok with her being OBC when she thought I was from OC. 


3) **Marathi Auntie**: This one's a bit hilarious. She sends me a message saying she really liked my profile for her daughter. I look it up and sure enough - mentioned 'any caste'. I give her my number and she sends me a complete biodata about her daughter. Daughter is really pretty and from MDI Gurgaon, I think great. But she mentions caste as 'Rigvedi Brahmin'. I think oh f**k. I send her all the details, mention my caste and even bracket it with '(SC)'. Immediately she goes, ""I really like your profile. Tell me the next steps or give me your parents number"". I'm like - this can't be happening. Then it hits me that maybe she has glanced over the caste part in her hurry. So I send another text saying,- ""ma'am pls confirm that you have seen my caste, and it falls under Scheduled Caste"". Never heard back from her.


There are a few more like this. Most of the profiles message me about my caste and go silent when I mention it. I realized that all my life, my circle of friends have ranged from all castes, religions and financial backgrounds and they never made me feel like a dalit or whatever. I have lived a happy and fairly successful life. That was the reason I was ignoring the caste aspect for finding someone to spend my life. 

Now I have learnt my lesson and changed my caste to clearly say SC and will stick to my own I guess. I also feel like giving up on these matrimony websites. It's been a great learning experience about my position in the society folks! :)"," You’re actually saving yourself from getting into a family of hypocrites. Not really a fuck up.

Good luck! I thought caste no longer existed in cities /s

Funny how the OBC girl was open-minded... for the castes above her.  OP, just invite me to your wedding, that's all I care about.

PS: I'm from okayish caste, not too high, not too low. Any caste generally means that they are okay with people of higher caste contacting them.  So ""open minded"" is my caste plus caste considered above mine. Matrimonial sites are hilarious and sad. 

just a thought, you are still 27 why hurry?  There was a gilded comment by a black guy a few days ago that said that he really appreciated when the bullets dogdged him for a change.  This is the same.  Unfortunately Indian matrimonial sites is just online aunty network without the aunties. There will be the same BS except it's online. 

Take some time out and start dating. In the grand scheme of things, finding the right person is as important as JEE. * **Any caste** means **any equal or higher caste**

Educated ""modern"" broad-minded Indian _hypocrites_.

OP, you dodged a bullet with every one of those.

Marry a girl who, as they say, ""loves you at your worst"". You are lucky you got matches. My friend (bengali upper caste) from IIM didn't get any matches when he didn't mention caste in his matrimonial profile 5 years ago. This is what modern day un-touchability looks like >  IIM passout

> working in a well known consulting firm 

>earning about 30LPA

> sincere, hardworking, simple dude

>Got 99.4 %ile in CAT

> AIR in 600's general in IITJEE

>Telugu 

*stops reading* IIM does not teach you that Indians are hypocrites of the first order? SC guy here, top educational institution and worked for top companies but not an IIT/IIM guy.

When I got married, the first line of my profile was I am an SC, dont believe in Reservation that benefits only the creamy layer. Rest of the stuff, I was very transparent about what I was looking for - a no-nonsense girl who is non-hypocrite, non pretentious humanist. Caste/religion no bar.

Got fair number of interests from inside and outside my caste. It was hard to see people with matching academic background from an SC caste. The non-SC interests I received were mostly from other religions.

Married to a no-nonsense unpretentious smart girl, her parents are from a brahman + other religion mix. A couple of my close friends who married within their caste have said they wished their married life was as stable as mine, after interacting with my wife and me for a while.

Hang on dude. Fuck this shit. I'm so tired of people acting all ""modern"" on the outside and being a casteist, hater on the inside. This is just ridiculous. 

Dude hugs man. I mean what can I say, just know that if someone asks you your caste they're not worth your time.  [removed] [deleted] [deleted] Lesson no 1. Those who developed a thinking that girls are some magical creatures and are very innocent and caring should know that they are human and just like men are in general shitty. Also given the chance they can act even worse than men and they do.

Lesson no 2. जात कुछ जाती नही

Caste never goes away.

Women at the time of arranged marriage will prefer someone from their caste only no matter how ""open minded,Liberal or progressive they claim to be""

The reason for this? All those lables are to fit in socially and nothing else.

Lesson no 3. Everyone's hypocritical. Some will admit maximum won't. That doesn't change the fact.  Shaadi ka laddu  ouch. some people just suck, OP.  This is just sad.

As much as I hate to say this, you should mention your caste on matrimony sites cos ppl do judge you based on caste and this unfortunately is the reality of India. Better to keep the hypocrites at bay. 

My parents had an inter-caste marriage. That being said, it is a fact there are differences in upbringing (type of food, type of interests etc.) and general attitude/mentality of people ( pet peeves, biases, dinner convos etc.) of families belonging to different castes. This isnt that big a deal if the couple plans to stay away from parents and love each other enough to get over the differences in mentality. But these differences cause a lot of issues when the couple decides to stay with either set of parents. Especially for the wife. I know my mom suffered a bit in her early days since she is from a lower caste compared to my dad, similar thing happened with one of my aunts. My dad stood by my mom and both of them were working and earning so things worked out eventually, my aunt ended up divorcing my uncle.

An upper caste friend of mine married an SC guy and her parents all but abandoned her, her husband's parents were somewhat accepting but issues did creep in over the years and now the couple are staying in a different city.

My advice would be to find a girl who is willing to relocate and not overly attached to parents/family or someone who has stayed abroad or has had a parent who has worked/stayed abroad. In those scenarios the caste issue will likely get diluted Whoa, from Tinder directly to a matrimony website? [deleted] You are being honest in India, mate. Won't work unless she is 1 in a million, who literally doesn't care. 

Ride solo instead. 🤘 i don't know if its true for most grills , but All of the grills i know never married below their so called ""caste strata"", but i know many guys who have relationships/marriages without a fuss about this. All the best OP, you will find a wonderful bride. Till then collect stories to publish a nice entertaining book. it shouldnt be TIFU but the others who f****** up by rejecting you based solely on caste. Good for you... I suggest leave this AM madness and look for someone who actually likes you!  So even a guy earning 30 lpa with IIT-IIM tag can't get over his caste when it comes to marriage 

Why are you not marrying within your community though ??  Damn! That is really sad to read. This must be really hurting for you.
I am SC too and nowhere near OP's financial and education status. I guess, I should start worry about marriage now. 

 I don't get the fuss around castes. I don't know the caste of my ex, I don't know the castes of my best friends, and I couldn't even be bothered to ask. It's an irrelevant label given to people that people don't even get to choose! Telugu people are casteist AF, no ? even here on randia caste feelings about marraige are pretty strong, people got triggered when sometime back i had suggested (after ambedkar) that people should marry outside their caste for eradicating caste system. but seems that caste runs too deeply in the indian psyche Wow i never knew caste is such a huge issue even in urban  areas. I know for a fact that I'm OBC (because 10th board forms. Never knew what my caste is), but I never knew what my exact caste is, since we never used the reservation. 
This discrimination is just saddening. Thank God I'm gay! >Got 99.4 %ile in CAT, also had got AIR in 600's general in IITJEE.

Go to Europe. Get cool job. Get white girl. They don't know what SC is. why not post this on /r/tifu thread? i mean a lot of foreigners comming here to experience religion should know what they are buying into. What you're facing is ""did not read the instructions carefully"". Indian people don't read instructions on a hazardous item also. Let alone a marriage profile.

And like others have said -- (though you are wasting time), you are saving yourself from hypocrites. This is sick. I hope you find someone good yourself than through this arranged marriage business. Good luck. Such is reality. But keep an open mind and don't give up and weeding out the assholes is easier at this phase than at a later stage -from a person in a similar situation as you Wow ! Great(?) experience, keep track of your experiences till you meet your wife and write a book. One day it can become a movie ! :) This is the saddest thing I have read today. What the fuck people.  Caste is well alive even in urban India. No matter what you get or achieve in your life, you will be always judged by your caste and color. Nothing can change this mentality. I think it happens for your good, can you imagine marry such narrow-minded girl? You saved yourself bro. keep trying on tinder! Lol see the down votes. 
Good Luck OP but I think 27 is too early to get married. Haha this is so funny and so fucked up. ""Incredible india"" This is so sad and disturbing if narrated events are True. I can understand if less educated villagers are caste conscious but highly educated professionals from Metro have such mindset? Shocked and appalled. Perhaps, I was mistaken that people get enlightened with education. [deleted] caste system can't be broken by sustaining the system. you have anyway rejected the reservations that you were provided, for which i respect you. so, i don't see why you should still be hanging onto a demeaning label that somebody else gave your ancestors. just make up a caste of your own and don't call yourself an SC. as far as i know, there is no law preventing you from creating a caste of your own. My best friend a SC is dating a Brahmin. I remember her mother found out and she told her he will never marry you, no higher casts would accept a SC daughter-in-law. Her mother was right. My friend is the daughter to two civil servants. Still this is the status quo.  So no one is talking about 30LPA. OP sorry for your condition, but being a dick that I m, would like sharing your CAT prep strategy.

Obligatory caste notification, Dont know the caste but I m a fucking Tribal  from Bihar and do look like one.

EDIT : Also do invite me to your wedding if you dont mind a tribal in your wedding If you don't mind me asking kaun jaat ho? I mean which caste?

Why I am asking is because most northies including Maharatrians won't know the Telugu caste hierarchy unless you tell them. 

So you can either say bluntly that you are SC or you can tell them in a softer fashion that your caste is classified as SC but it isn't comparable to northie hierarchy and also highlight your own achievements. I mean soften the blow.

Now I am going to  be criticised for what I said above as it's playing the caste game and not taking the high road. However caste is a reality. Also you have chosen arranged marriage route so you can't escape it. Also your own post starts with claming you aren't stereotyptocal SC and you want to play up that card.  Soceital attitudes that makes one cringe. Racism (Skin-color), casteism, or communalism (religion) - these attitudes are programmed into us by an earlier generation , consciously or unconsciously. Its our choice if we want to *work at* eliminating them from our psyche - these are like layers of an onion - impossible to cast off in one go.  

Being in contact with diverse people can of course speed up the unlearning. You're fucking better off bro. You're killing it professionally (and you can only go up from here) and you're obviously intelligent and well educated. I'm not saying this to lift your spirits or whatever, you don't need that shit. What I'm saying is, if these people want to cling to archaic bullshit, let them. They may think you're beneath them but they're wrong. You outclass them by far. You do you bruh. I will die alone someday because I am of lower caste too minus the IIM pass out and fat paycheck stuff.

I once passed out in front of a college so I guess that counts :D Dude, what do you expect in India? It's uniformly hypocritical. Live and learn, I guess. **becuase there is a caste system , there's so much of reservation** 
Now , why do you want to curb down the 49% that the general category has ? 
I'm against the part where they allow them to take a general seat . 
I know reservation can't be eliminated fully , atleast not in the near future  Matrimonial sites are cancer. Avoid them at all costs. It's better to get fixed by relatives. Maybe I don't really understand the issues of the SC/ST but why would you actively identify with something that has kept you and your people down for so long? You could have just said you were buddhist and have lived without a caste for the last 3 generations.

You could have been happily married by now OP but instead you would rather everyone know that you're part of a victimized subjugated interest group. > I figured I was ready to get married.

How ya figure that? long time no sex? I wanna know coz me 26.  You have worked hard for everything in life, work a little bit more for that SO, who accepts everything from you.  Teli? Isn't that Jewish? You got jebaited.... :/ Bullet dodged like Neo from the Matrix, OP! Congrats and good luck in your spouse-hunt! As far as my experience goes - Even girls who are 'liberal' (  fuck around) mostly end up with with guys from their own caste only  Arranged marriage is a fucked up process, OP. If it is any consolation, I'm from an upper caste and I explicitly mentioned that I don't give a fuck about caste on my matrimonial profile only to face rejection from both upper and lower castes. 
I was dumped by my gf of 2 years the moment her parents found out I'm a different caste and went on to emotionally blackmail her. Mind you, her caste is lower than mine. She even had this super liberal JNU feminist personality facade about her. Imagine my heartbreak when she jumped on the first opportunity to get hitched to an UPSC job guy her parents introduced to her. Her parents' main objection? My caste. IIM is one caste i like. haha. Can i send my matrimonial page link for you to check? Let meknow [deleted] You said you never used reservation. Here's a take on why people don't : when you're eligible in the general category too , you use  the 'general' seat so that a seat in reservation remains empty , so someone else who got a lower rank can get that benefit. That's how general seats get eaten up. That's not something to be proud of , actually !  > lemme clarify that I never used it. Got 99.4 %ile in CAT, also had got AIR in 600's general in IITJEE

For non reserved candidates, that just makes it worse... putting salt on a wound. >AIR in 600's general


So you chose not to pick a better course at a better IIT using your quota? If you didn't, you're stupid. If you did, you did actually make use of the reservations benefits


There's no need to be this smug and patronizing. Marriages are social contracts, it involves adapting yourself to your spouse's family/culture in varying degrees. If someone's not fond of a certain group of people, ofcourse theyre not going to marry into that caste. 

Also, different castes have different track records with status of women. So if an upper caste woman refuses to marry a guy from a largely illiterate lower caste, it is very much understandable since chances are very high her freedom is going to be severely curtailed. Did you find any girls who were fine with your caste but felt family wont approve? Did you suggest any to try to discuss about your caste with their family?  Which IIM ? When did you pass out? Where do you work now? 
Edit: why the hate? Just want to make friends Why the fuck would someone WANT to marry below his or her social strata if given the choice?"

I am pretty sure no prominent figure is gonna raise their voice against this.    
We are on our own.    
 Agle janam mohe minority hi kijo.   
 The worst thing about this reservation is that the government thinks job is just a one-way monthly income to the worker. The government never thinks of the quality of the work / importance of having merit do the job. This has the potential to irrepairably damage the standard of education / health and government services. Probably when an MP would have to get operated on by a non-meritous SC / ST surgeon they would know.

They should keep STEM merit based and away from reservation. How much empowerment does one need before feeling empowered? Apparently, not even after having a job.

I fail to see the rationale behind this. When in opposition, these sanghis would have called such a move ""appeasement"". I guess party with a difference is only different in terms of having a forked tongue.

I'm not even getting into merits of reservations in promotions- if designed properly, those would help counter the inherent bias within the system. However, knowing how spectacularly""the most capable administrator in india"" botched gst implementation, by passing a law without thinking (one country, one tax, only in name), and implementing it without being prepared, i can bet that there hasn't been any thought beyond, ""how can we split the dalit vote?"" Yeah fuck that.  Fine as long as its clerical work.  But I don't want my chief of surgery to be an average student. Where merit matters,  relaxation of criteria shouldn't be there. It's not going to be a big problem if you promote a 95% percent scoring SC/ST guy over a 97% general,  but not very good for general public when a general guy with all India rank 20,000 doesn't get admission to a govt medical college but a scst student who didn't even qualify for the admission has been admitted because there weren't any candidates from that caste who scored more than 50th percentile.

**SC, ST quota in promotion: Narendra Modi government takes this big decision** 

 ______ 
The move comes following a recent verdict by the Supreme Court in this regard.
(PTI)

The Centre today asked all its departments and the state governments to
implement reservation in promotion for employees belonging to Scheduled Caste
(SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) categories. The move comes following a recent
verdict by the Supreme Court in this regard. The Personnel Ministry, in an
order, said, “The cadre controlling authorities of Central government
ministries, departments and Union territories are to carry out promotions in
accordance with the directions of the Supreme Court.” Every promotion order
must clearly mention the stipulation that the promotion shall be subject to
further orders which may be passed by the Supreme Court, it said. According to
the order, besides the Central government departments concerned, state
governments are also advised to take necessary action in this matter.

The personnel ministry order will be applicable to SC and ST category
employees working with the Centre and the state governments, an officer said.
The apex court had on June 5 allowed the Centre to go ahead with reservation
in promotion for employees belonging to the SC and ST category in “accordance
with law”.

The top court took into account the Centre’s submissions that entire process
of promotion has come to a “standstill” due to the orders passed by various
high courts and the apex court had also ordered for “status quo” in a similar
matter in 2015. “We will say you (Centre) can go ahead with promotion in
accordance with law,” a vacation bench comprising Justices Adarsh Kumar Goel
and Ashok Bhushan had told Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Maninder Singh,
representing the Centre.

During the hearing, the ASG cited the case laws on the issue of quota in
promotion in government jobs and stated that the apex court’s 2006 judgement
in M Nagaraj case would be applicable. The M Nagaraj verdict had said that
creamy layer concept cannot be applied to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled
Tribes for promotions in government jobs like two earlier verdicts of 1992
Indra Sawhney and others versus Union of India (popularly called Mandal
Commission verdict) and 2005 E V Chinnaiah versus State of Andhra Pradesh,
which dealt with creamy layer in Other Backward Classes category.

On November 15 last year, a three-judge bench of the apex court had agreed to
consider whether its 11-year-old judgement in M Nagaraj case was needed to be
re-visited. The nine-judge bench of Supreme Court had, in the Indira Sawhney
case in 1992, permitted reservation for the SCs and STs in promotion to
continue for a period of five years from November 16, 1992.

***The move comes following a recent verdict by the Supreme Court in this regard.*** 

But Modi ""did it"" ... /s

 ""Why are Indians settling in abroad?"" Sab Ka Sath. Sub ka Vikas The rationale behind this move seems to be to counter the domination of upper castes in certain posts like that of secretary in a ministry. There was a study done in 2013 which showed that out of 150 posts of secretary, there were 0 SC's and about 3 ST's. Its unimaginable that out of 150 posts the govt/establishment wasnt able to find even 1 SC IAS officer for a secretary level post. 

Even today you can take a look at the secretaries from the important ministries and you'll find a majority of them are from the upper castes.

Reservation in promotion makes the concept of reservation more meaningful. A lot of deputations are decided upon the discretion of the govt/minister. No marks for guessing which group gets the maximum bulk of those posts.

I am currently in my 25th week (late 2nd trimester) and I'm trying to educate myself about what lies ahead for me. I have to zero in on the most important decision - the city of birth (job city?/my hometown?/husband's hometown?). I need to decide this ASAP as traveling after 28 weeks(April end that is) is generally not advised.

Which brings me to making this post here. I want to gather all the information/anectodes/experiences, in a countdown way, about the D-Day/D-weeks. If the circumstances allow, I would prefer a normal delivery. However, I totally understand how uncertain pregnancies can get. I just feel being informed can help us stay less anxious & not panic. Its going to be long and my thoughts might seem all over the place, so please bear with me. Here are my questions:

1) How frequent are the scheduled* OB/GYN visits in the very last month, assuming a normal pregnancy? Currently I visit once a month, for routine check up and milestone/mandated tests (flu vaccination, various blood tests, sonography, etc)

*(By scheduled I mean no complication was experienced by the woman or any urgency(water breaking, bleeding, etc) occured)

2) One lady who had the same OBGYN as me when went for her scheduled 37th week visit, was told she will have a C-Section as the child is getting overweight (weighing 3 kgs then). The OBGYN asked her to soon decide which date she would like the surgery to happen and let the doctor know. The lady said she however got labor pain the very next day and delivered via vaginal delivery. Now, I am a little skeptical here; from what I've read, **2.5-3.5 kgs is the average birth weight for newborns in India**. How can 3 kgs be overweight then? I'm already very paranoid about the state of deliveries in urban, big-name hospitals and this incident scares me more. There is no data public on the number of normal and surgical deliveries a hospital has, so that one can decide, and once you're in, you're in. After that, you have to leave everything at the doctor.

3) One lady who delivered at the same hospital (different OBGYN) as me, went at 37 weeks when she felt contractions. Her cervix was examined twice in a 5 hour span. She said she couldn't bear going through that painful examination again and asked for a C-Section herself (totally fair). My question is, are these cervix examinations by hand so necessary, when they're leaving the bearing lady in pain? Is there no other way (imaging, ultrasound, etc)? My point is those contractions could have been what is called 'false labor' and if not for the pain due to the examination, that lady could have gone home and come again full-term or when she felt contractions again?

4) My sister went for a scheduled visit in 38th week. Her cervix was examined, she started bleeding. She was told to come back if bleeding continued till evening, which it did. She had to be operated the next day, after staying in labor room for some 24-32 hours. This again makes me skeptical about cervix examinations.

5) What's the countdown going to be like? When does one know that ""yes, its now that I rush to the hospital."" Should I be scared of just a few drops of blood? Should I rush the very first time I experience period like cramps? From my few interactions with mothers, I feel 37-38 weeks is the sweet spot where many things happen. I know my post gives a lot of distrusting vibes towards doctors, that they're there to loot us, they try to 'invent' some complication in these sweet spot weeks to push for C-Sections, etc. Trust me, I would like to be proven wrong. Hence, I'm here to collect as much anectodes about false alarms, doctor sending the lady home even after mild contractions as its not time yet instead of asking to schedule a C-Section, etc as I can.

5) From what I understand, some women might never experience labor even after 40-41 weeks and hence have to be induced. Are some women induced before that too? What could lead to induction before full term?

6) Do all women having a vaginal delivery get an epidural/other pain medication, or only those who demand it when they get tired, or when they can't bear pain?

7) Did anyone research natural birth centers? There are many in the major cities, like 1) Sanctum Birth Center, Hyderabad, 2) Birth Village, Kochi, 3) Daimaas Natural Birth Center, Mumbai, 4) Apollo Cradle, Gurugram. Google reviews are mixed. Anyone undertook the services of these natural birth centers?

So everyone, contribute what you can towards my questions & in general, your pregnancy stories."," OP, post this in r/TWOXINDIA as well. https://www.babycenter.com/childbirth-class has all you need to know about child birth. Regarding centers,city,hospital, I don’t know. India C section is becoming very much the de facto option which is sad malpractice by doctors. Most cases natural birth is possible without much medication. 3 of my kids were natural born without any medication. 4th one (actually our 2nd) she took epidural. 1. Depends on the risk factors. High risk pregnancies require weekly monitoring. Otherwise bi monthly suffice.
2. 3 is average and is by no means overweight.   
3. Cervical examination is done to check how much the cervix has dilated. I was checked every hour when I went in while in labor (about 3-4 times). Ended up with a emergency c section as large baby + baby in distress.
4. Any bleeding in late term, even if it's due to cervical examination needs to be monitored. Unless the doctor did a membrane sweep, there shouldnt really be a bleeding but then again depends on sensitivity I guess.
5. I had a cervical check a day prior to my labor (I was at week 39 and very close to my due date) and I had no bleeding but went into labor naturally much later at night. I woke up with back pain after midnight and I just knew this was it. Went to the loo, water broke, told my husband it was time and then woke up my parents. Waddled to hospital 2 hours later after I timed my contractions and knew they were getting a min apart. 
6. High risk and multiples. Also Indian doctors love inducing women even when they are in labor to reduce the labor time which makes it much harder on the women (I was induced despite being in labor already and the pain shot through the roof).
7. Only large hospitals can administer pain relief for vaginal birth as most hospitals in india don't have monitoring systems in place to check for contractions and tell the woman to push. 
8. None. I was birthing at my home town. So I chose the one which had a sensible doc that would listen to me and not swat my concerns as ""google"" led. Look up water birthing, think there's one in Kerala but I'm of the ""give birth in hospital"" opinion as I don't know how equipped these centers are to handle post natal and intensive care for babies. 
All the best. Best to cross post to the twoxindia sub as well."

### So this is my situation


I on the last round of interview for an Irish company. And I don't have a passport yet ( I know it's dumb ). So I applied for the passport and went to the passport office today and my application got rejected due to the lack of identification documents.

I went there with 3 docs. Aadhar, pan And my sslc certificate.
I only have Aadhar, and pan card as identification docs. ( I have voters ID but the name in there is spelled wrong ). So the mam at the counter told me if there is any other documents I have, and suggested that I can get a online birth certificate. So I went to the near by Cafe and took a print out of the birth certificate. 

But in that, my name was given with out my initials. So the Assistant Passport officer rejected my application. 


So when I went back to ask what else I can do . The mam at the counter told me that if I applied for non tatkal passport I will need only two identification documents ( plus sslc certificate ). 

So I came back home and went to nearest *E-seva Kendra* to reapply for the passport in  non tatkal way.

## problem 2

Imagine my name is *Michael Jackson Obama*

So in my sslc certificate my name is written as *Michael JO.* And in my Aadhar and pan card it's written as *Michael Jackson Obama* . So he says that I cannot apply passport like this. I have to change my name in the sslc certificate to match my Aadhar. 

*Q1:* But the passport officer didn't mention any of these. Is that. Problem ? 

Changing my name in my sslc could take up to a couple of weeks. But if it takes that long I could lose my job.

I currently don't have licence. 

*Q2:* what are my options for getting a passport ASAP. ?


**Edit :- 10/03/2020**

I went to meet my uncle's friend who has some knowledge on these things. 

So I have been told that there will be no problem for me to apply passport via non tatkal route. 
Since my name on the PAN card and Aadhar is just expanded form of my name in the sslc certificate. So that won't be a problem. Appointment for the passport office has been scheduled at 16th March so I will post what happens next.


**Edit :- 16/04/2020**

I finished the interview in the passport office with out any trouble. They asked me which name I want in my passport. **Michael JO** or **Michael Jackson Obama**. So the whole process was over under 45mins. So waiting for police verification now."," Sorry for this, unethical suggestion,

Contact a broker. He will take some extra money and get the job done.

He might charge you extra to get the name changed in Aadhar and PAN according to your SSLC certificate.

Brokers have contacts who can get things done with as few requirements as possible. Hey man. I have a similar problem. I asked about it here a while back. You can check on my profile.

I haven't applied for a passport yet but I got an affidavit published in the state gazette that both my names on Aadhar card and SSC certificate are the same. So I'm gonna use that when I do apply.

308,Scheduled,Appreciation to Maharashtra Government,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fl8lmk/appreciation_to_maharashtra_government/,"Read the post-script if you feel that I am wrong at any line. (Post Script is at the end)

I am neither related to any political party nor I want to support or say bad about any Political Party. This post is just to appreciate Maharashtra Government and to give reason for people in Maharashtra to support the Government to fight against Coronavirus.

The steps that Maharashtra Government took to fight against Coronavirus may look drastic and unnecessary but I wish to say something about it. Many developed countries like USA, Spain, Italy etc. have taken these measures after the virus spread. In Maharashtra as of today morning, according to news channels, although there were 49 infected people, 40 of them came from other countries and just 9 were the ones who were in contact with the affected. For a  heavily populated country like India, these numbers are almost unbelievable. If the government did not take such drastic measures, these numbers would not have been so small. I agree that these measures disturb our schedule and many think that this is just a step by Medical Industries to increase income but WHO wouldn't have taken the steps during already going on recession.

These numbers are better than many Developed countries. We have to appreciate Maharashtra Government for their hardwork and co-operate with them. If everyone cooperates with the Government then Government will surely loosen the restrictions and we will have less trouble. 

Don't overestimate your immune system and don't assume that you won't get infected. Just follow the instructions given out by the Health Minister. 

P.S.: These are just my own thoughts. You can choose to ignore them if you disagree"," Let me explain why \*I think\* these are incorrect numbers:

Because you are comparing with the countries in west, let me tell you that those numbers are based on extensive testing on people. So if people show symptoms like cough, fever, cold, they get tested for this virus along with others. Which is why there are many positive cases in west.

Now in India, ask how many of people who have the above symptoms have got tested for this virus. Or even went to the Doctor? The less you test, the less the numbers you will get. The countries in west are already in under almost total lockdown, yet the numbers are increasing (due to the high R0 of the virus). While in India, we still have many major companies & businesses operating in full-capacity mode, big crowded markets in Mumbai still open like almost every day.  There is no point in shutting down the schools & keeping kids at home if their parents are going to work everyday in Mumbai locals & coming back home. There is absolutely no reason yet to believe that the virus hasn't really spread or the number of real infected persons are that low.

As a human first & Indian second, I really do hope that we do somehow have low numbers & we are doing a real good job. This could be one example where India could standout strong among other major countries once this is all over. But right now, it is too early to say that we are in a better position than other countries. Hi I'd like to say that I work in Healthcare in one of the biggest companies in India and even though the govt is trying to do a good job which is commendable, they've been lying about the numbers. We've known and we reported it at least two weeks ago before that info went public and also, they've messed with the numbers. It's way drastic than it seems but ofc I understand the logic behind it. They're trying to make the public not panic. Understandable Readyplayerone80 Have u guys checked his profile"

Do you see any improvement in the situation nation wide by then?"," Say sorry to everyone . Explain them that it's in their interest . Cancel the lavish ceremonies . Make it a 2 families joint function with closest relatives . Save money. Gift the couple with FD. Profit . The situation is going to deteriorate significantly in my opinion.

If you have money, send everyone a memoribilia through courier. Fucking canc it already. Even only family would be a large gathering .. what with travel restrictions and all... Better to postpone Hey, so my wedding was in a week and we postponed it to whenever things have settled down a bit. Having been through the mess that is making this decision, these are my two cents: 1. Realise that older people and family will insist on attending this wedding because it’s family and shaadi and what not. If they do end up coming or you end up travelling, realise the risk you are putting yourselves and most importantly the older people in the family. Ask yourself if you want this wedding to be probably remembered as the one where a bunch of people caught the virus (hoping that doesn’t happen); 2. If the couple want a smaller wedding and that is a possibility, then do that. Just very close family or just a registered wedding with a reception later when this shit has calmed down; 3. While the family may have put in a lot of effort into planning this wedding and having a big bash, understand that these are extraordinary circumstances and everyone needs to step back and realise that things will not work as planned. We agreed to wait for a few months and if the situation doesn’t improve by then we will probably have a small ceremony and move on with our lives. It’s a very hard decision but for us the fact that we didn’t want to put anyone in danger especially the older guests and our parents took precedence. Good luck and stay safe! You have to cancel it mate. It's only going to get worse from here. Covid-19 isn't going anytime soon. India may well be at the start of the peak that is yet to come. Even conservative estimates put at least 30 crore getting infected in the next 2-3 months. Even with a 0.1% mortality rate(actual is 20x that), it is a grim grim 2020 summer we are looking at.

I think your guests and relatives will understand if you cancel the wedding. And even if you won't, the government sure as shit won't let a mass gathering happen at a time when fatalities would have surely increased.

(I have close relative whose wedding is getting cancelled too. And most people understand why.) Also for additional info, we are in mumbai and the bride is in Rajasthan, so even a family affair seems highly doubtful.

Thanks for your advices we'd better postpone it. you cancel it like everyone else and say sorry. My friend's wedding on April 9th was changed from Kerala back to Delhi, and now they have cancelled it, until further notice Bro same situation except my wedding same plan just closed wedding. But don't know if we will be able to travel between cities Save it for later, also the Indian economy is going to be hit the most. So unnecessary spending is not advised."

Important controversial Judgement: Justice Goel’s judgment on prevention of misuse of SC/ST Act in Dr. Shubhash Kashinath Mahajan vs. The State of Maharashtra, is one of the much talked about decision. Justice Goel along with Justice Lalit examined the question on the inclusion of procedural safeguards so that the provisions of Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) (SC/ST) Act 1989 are not abused for extraneous considerations. The Bench held that, a Government official cannot be prosecuted on mere allegation of committing an offence under the Act without the sanction of appointing authority. [1](https://www.indialegallive.com/constitutional-law-news/courts-news/justice-ak-goel-retires-from-sc-defends-his-judgment-in-sc-st-act-51270) [2](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/justice-ak-goel-who-ruled-on-dalit-atrocities-law-retires-from-top-court-1879280)

***So what about him?***

Let's go back to Vajpayee's government when Arun Jaitley was Minister of Law and Justice.

From Article: [Govt ignored IB report on HC judge](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Govt-ignored-IB-report-on-HC-judge/articleshow/45701970.cms).

>*High court judges are appointed in the following way: The state government sends a list of names through the governor to the chief justices of the Supreme Court and the concerned high court. This list is then sent to the law ministry, which obtains an IB report on the nominees. Thereafter, it prepares a matrix with three criteria â€” professional competence, integrity and political links.*  
>  
>*In the case of Goel, the law ministry matrix contains no entry under the ''Professional Competence'' column, while the ''Reputation/Integrity'' column bluntly says: ""Corrupt person"".*  
>  
>*The key to his subsequent appointment appears to be the listing in the political affiliation column, which notes that Goel was general secretary of the All-India Adhiwakta Parishad, the lawyers'' wing of the RSS. Curiously, among the five short-listed advocates whose integrity the IB had questioned, he was the only one cleared by the ministry.*  
>  
>*Having sent back the file once, Narayanan had the constitutional obligation of approving the appointment but he made his unhappiness clear. The President noted: ""Nonetheless, I feel that a more desirable course of action would have been to follow the same procedure as was done in a similarly placed case of the Calcutta High Court where the advice of the Chief Justice, which is integral to the selection process, was sought again and duly received...I would also appreciate if my instant observations are shared with the Chief Justice of India along with my earlier observation dated May 3, 2001 on this matter.""*

***He then became the Chief Justice of the Odisha High Court and the Gauhati High Court before becoming the Supreme Court Judge.***

I'm planning a honeymoon trip to either Uttarakhand or Himachal for me and my fiance (Provided Corona settles down). These two are the places that we're interested in right now, but suggestions are welcome for any other hillstation/scenic places too. Budget is around 50k flexible for 3/4 days and 3/4 nights.

Even though Shimla/Manali were common choices, it looks airports are far from these places and I don't wanna sit in bus/car for 9hrs+ straight. I'm looking for places which have airports much closer and Dehradun came up. I was thinking of may be covering Dehradun, Nainital etc. in June.

1. Are Dehradun and Nainital good for a peaceful honeymoon trip? I'm not looking to cover a lot of places with a tight schedule. I'd rather visit a few calm and quiet scenic places and spend a bit of time there.
2. Is the weather nice there in June or will it be too hot? Also in case Corona situation continues how's the weather during July/August? I don't wanna extend it too much to really cold weather either.
3. I'm planning to book hotels on my own and hire a cab with driver for the duration. Any suggestion on this? Looking for reliability more than anything, since this will be our first trip I don't want any hassles as you can imagine. Or any reliable packages that I should look into?
4. Any other scenic places near to these locations that I must visit? Like I mentioned before I don't wanna spend a lot of time in car especially if the terrain is rough.

Thanks you for reading and sorry for the long post."," June/July in hill stations means over crowded shit 1. Yes, both of them peaceful places... The landscapes, rivers, mountains are something you should look forward in the Uttarakhand 

2. Dehradun use to have really pleasent weather (30-32° in peak summers) but hopefully Rains don't become a spoil sport :)

3. Hotels and all won't be really expensive (i guess) 

4. 3-4 days will be enough to explore both of these places according to me (Dehradun and Nanital) ... 

P.S. Make sure to book hotels beforehand June/July the monsoons are in a full swing here in Himachal ( Dharamshala especially) so do take that aspect into consideration as well . May, June 2020 ? Forget it. Better to postpone the wedding right away, Go NE. Tourists rarely go there, weather is nice if you like rains, peaceful and scenic environment.

I don't want my idea of what Indians believe to be made up entirely of my family's steriotypes of what this community is. 

In addition to being of Pakistani descent and from a muslim family, I am also gay. I was shocked when India legalized gay marriage. I always thought Pakistani and Indian culture to be so similar. This was what piqued my interest in India. I wanted to gain a greater understanding of the mentality and political compass of Indians as far as I could understand it through Reddit (which I understand is not necessarily demonstrative of the majority of Indian voters).

Countless times I have been inspired by the Indian Reddit community's relentless efforts to cling to the secular identity of Indian political culture. Time and time again, I read about Indian pride for being the largest democracy. This is in most cases, within the context of a diverse community. People of every faith and every ethnicity all as Indian citizens sharing a common but spectacularly diverse culture.  

I am so glad that I chose to follow this subreddit or I probably wouldn't know that there is in fact a very large population of Indians who object to islamophobia or racist views of the vast subcultures of India. 

So I just wanted to thank everyone who stands for the Indian cultural ideal of tolerance and inclusiveness. It's very inspiring and I hope that bigots around the globe can learn a thing or two from this.

Edit: It has been pointed out that in fact gay marriage has not been legalized, rather, sodomy has been decriminalized. I stand corrected and apologize for this misconception. I do still however maintain that it is an excellent step in the right direction as another commenter has mentioned."," Thank you mate <3. One day, I will go visit Pakistan and experience the culture there. Thanks for the note.

Not to take away from your points, or discredit this sub, but unfortunately I doubt this subreddit reflects the majority sentiment among India's youth. 

Uneducated bigotry and hatred among communities runs deep in this country. At a very basic level, it can dictate who gets jobs and who can and cannot rent an apartment in a locality.

This sub inspires me too, but any illusions about right wing fanaticism coming to an end in India are just that, pure delusion. This will be a long fight, and one which we must recognise is worth fighting even if we don't win in the end. Caste hindus repressing muslims these days, its a sinister ploy, so nobody turns their head  towards the upper caste hindu treatment of the low caste hindus, scheduled castes and scheduled tribes. >  India legalized gay marriage. 

This has not happened. Homosexuality has been decriminalized though. You don't go to jail for gay sex anymore. Gay marriage will take more time to materialise.

Reddit India by itself is more like a minuscule influencer. Has some effect on the overall situation, but nothing compared to popular social media.

But the youth have surprised many. My own generation has become entirely biased, and often hate-filled, eager to feel good listening to bombast and applauding cruelty. The kids - some of them - are doing a much better job than us. Dude get your facts straight, India DID NOT legalize gay marriage it just decriminalized sodomy. Way away from legalization."

### 1) SARS-­CoV-­2 

* A paper published in a recent issue of the peer­reviewed, open­access journal ‘Emerging Microbes and Infections’ has cautioned that SARS­-CoV-­2, the virus causing the COVID-­19 outbreak, is being shed through multiple routes, so testing through oral swabs alone might not be sufficient
* A paper by Wei Zhang, et al, all from the CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, says investigations on patients in a local hospital infected with the virus revealed the presence of SARS-CoV-­2 in anal swabs and blood as well. What’s more, more anal swabs than oral swabs tested positive at a later stage of infection. Since COVID­19 is believed to be a disease of the respiratory tract, usually only oral swabs are used for diagnosis, and discharge is based on the oral swabs testing negative. The anal positives suggested, they argued, shedding through the oral ­fecal route, and therefore transmission is possible as well. The researchers also showed that a serology test (testing blood for antibodies) can improve detection positive rate, and thus should be used in the future.
* As part of the research, samples ­ including oral swabs, anal swabs and blood were collected by Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital. Two investigations were performed the paper describes ­ In the first investigation, samples were taken from 39 patients, 7 of whom were in a ‘severe condition’. In the second investigation, samples were lifted from 139 patients, whose clinical records were not available.
* When counting all swab positives together, we found most of the positives came from oral swab (8/10, 80%) on day 0. However, this trend appears to change on day 5. We found more (6/8, 75%) anal swab positive than oral swab positive (4/8, 50%)
* The data suggested a shift from more oral positives during the early period to more anal positives during the later period
* The current strategy for the detection of viral RNA in oral swabs used for 2019­nCoV diagnosis is not perfect. The virus may be present in anal swabs or blood of patients when oral swabs detection negative
* This observation implies that a patient cannot be discharged purely based on oral swabs testing negative, and the researchers go on to make a recommendation to do serological tests to confirm the status

#### About Coronaviruses

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.

#### What is COVID-19?

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

#### About SARS

The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. SARS is more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003.

* The 2020 G20 Presidency will focus discussions, forums, working groups and Ministerial Meetings under the theme of “Realizing Opportunities of the 21st Century for All”.

#### Key Points

* Global Economy:
   * The global economic growth remains slow and downside risks due to the geopolitical and remaining trade tensions, and policy uncertainty.
   * Though the economic growth is expected to increase in 2020 and 2021 due to loose monetary policy and an easing of trade tensions.
* IMF’ Views at the Meeting:
   * It projects a “V-shaped, rapid recovery” for the global economy, but it warns about the uncertainty around the spread of the coronavirus (COVID 19).
   * The IMF also warned about other risks including rising debt levels in some countries as well as climate change.
* Demand for Global Taxation System:
   * It discussed ways to achieve consensus on a global taxation system for the digital era by the end of 2020.
   * It aims to allow governments to tax digital companies where they do business, rather than where they are registered for tax purposes.
   * India has also demanded closer collaboration between international revenue agencies to investigate the tax affairs of offenders who cross borders for escaping tax investigation.

#### G-20

* About
   * The G20 is an informal group of 19 countries and the European Union, with representatives of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
   * The G20 membership comprises a mix of the world’s largest advanced and emerging economies, representing about two-thirds of the world’s population, 85% of global gross domestic product, 80% of global investment and over 75% of global trade.
* Headquarter
   * The G20 operates as a forum and not as an organization. Therefore, it does not have any permanent secretariat or management and administrative structure.
* Origin
   * 1997-1999 Asian Financial Crisis: This was a ministerial-level forum that emerged after G7 invited both developed and developing economies. The finance ministers and central bank governors began meeting in 1999.
   * Amid the 2008 Financial Crisis, the world saw the need for a new consensus-building at the highest political level. It was decided that the G20 leaders would begin meeting once annually.
* Members
   * The members of the G20 are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union.
   * One nation holds the Chair every year, known as the 'G20 Presidency'. Argentina chaired the G20 summit of 2018 and Japan for 2019.
* V-Shaped Recovery
   * A V-shaped recovery is characterized by a sharp economic decline followed by a quick and sustained recovery.
   * The recession of 1953 is an example of a V-shaped recovery.
   * A V-shaped recovery is different from an L-shaped recovery, in which the economy stays in a slump for a prolonged period.

* The main objectives of the e-Court Project are as follows:
   * To provide efficient & time-bound citizen-centric service delivery.
   * To develop, install & implement decision support systems in courts.
   * To automate the processes to provide transparency of Information access to its stakeholders.
   * To enhance judicial productivity both qualitatively & quantitatively, to make the justice delivery system affordable, accessible, cost-effective & transparent.
* The e-Courts National portal (ecourts.gov.in) was launched in 2013. This provides Case Status, daily Case-list, Cases Filed and Cases Registered through the Case information System (CIS) Software.
* The National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) is a part of the e-Courts Integrated Mission Mode Project. It was launched in 2015. The aim is to track judicial performance across different courts in the country.
   * The NJDG is working as a National data warehouse for case data including the orders/judgments for Courts across the country.
   * NJDG works as a monitoring tool to identify, manage & reduce pendency of cases.
   * It also helps to provide timely inputs for making policy decisions to reduce delay and arrears in the system, facilitate better monitoring of court performance and systemic bottlenecks, and, thus, facilitate better resource management.
   * NJDG has specifically helped India improve its ranking in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Report.

### 6) Joint Commands

Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) office is working on a tentative timeline for the establishment of joint commands among the three defense services Army, Navy and Air Force beginning with an Air Defence Command.

#### Joint Commands

* It is a unified command in which the resources of all the services are unified under a single commander looking at a geographical theatre.
* Meaning, a single military commander, as per the requirements, will have the resources of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force to manage a security threat.
* Functions of joint command:
   * The commander of a joint command will have the freedom to train and equip his command.
   * He will have the logistics of all the services at his beckoning.
   * However, the three services will retain their independent identities as well.
* Joint command at present:
   * There are two tri-services commands at the moment.
   * The joint command at the moment, the Andaman and Nicobar Command (ANC), is a theatre command, which is headed by the chiefs of the three services in rotation. It was created in 2001 after a Group of Ministers had given a report on national security following the Kargil War.
   * The Strategic Forces Command was established in 2006 and is a functional tri-services command.
* What is the structure right now?
   * There are 17 commands, divided among the three services.
   * The Army and the Air Force have seven commands each, while the Navy has three commands.
   * These commands report to their respective services and are headed by three-star officers.
   * Though these commands are in the same regions, they are no located together.
* Need for joint commands?
   * The leader of unified command has control over more varied resources, compared to the heads of the commands under the services now. And the officer commanding will have access to the Air Force’s fighter jets and can use them if needed. Through such integration and jointness, the three forces will be able to avoid duplication of resources. The resources available under each service will be available to other services too. The services will get to know one another better, strengthening cohesion in the defense establishment.
* Do the militaries of other countries have such commands?
   * Several major militaries are divided into integrated theatre commands. China’s People’s Liberation Army has five theatre commands: Eastern, Western, Northern, Southern and Central. Its Western Theatre Command is responsible for India. The US Armed Forces have 11 unified commands, of which seven are geographic and four functional commands. Its geographic commands are Africa, Central, European, Indo-Pacific, Northern, Southern, and Space. Cyber, Special Operations, Transportation and Strategic are its functional commands.

* This corridor will be a threat to the adjoining Nameri Tiger Reserve in Assam too.

#### What should the Govt. do?

* The Government, while building such a mega project, should consult renowned conservation organizations in the area and also bring all stakeholders who will be impacted by the project on to the negotiating table.

#### Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR)

* It lies in the foothills of the Eastern Himalaya in the East Kameng district of Arunachal Pradesh.
* It falls within the Eastern Himalaya Biodiversity Hotspot.
* Pakke is also the only Hornbill sanctuary in India.

I didn't learnt anything . I was having headache over the day. People Who Had Attended The coaching for long hours, How you survived? Did you learn anything?... Knowledge Is being drained into brain constantly for 7 hours !"," [deleted] >How you survived?

Take proper rest. Sleep on time and eat well. It'll help tremendously. Your coaching time is when you should be the most attentive, if you're having headaches, you won't be able to focus properly.

>Did you learn anything?

If I was interested in the topic and my head felt in place, the classes were indeed fun and I learnt a lot. Some of the coaching teachers are very good. If it was a difficult or boring topic, my mind usually drifted away, and not paying attention in class only caused problems in future. Reading a little about the topic that's going to be taught beforehand helps.

If you actually understand what's being taught, it'll become MUCH easier to sit through those 7 hours, trust me. If you didn't get anything in the class today, read your notes, read the textbook, watch YouTube videos on the topic. Watch the video over and over till you finally understand what your coaching teacher was trying to say. There are many good YouTube channels for JEE syllabus, they helped me more than any notes or textbook. 

If you go to the next class without knowing what was taught in this class, it'll only get worse from there.

And bro, I've been in your place. It's very difficult, but you can't do anything about it expect make sure the hardwork you do gives you the result you want. Please make a proper schedule and stick to it. Always analyze how you do the in the exams, and take them seriously. Most importantly, please don't procrastinate. All the best! Education is important but it is so so overrated in our country. 

Plus most Indian students have no practical knowledge at all of what they learn.

I would like to tell you that don't force yourself if you don't like something just because everyone else is doing it.. Like if you don't like coaching classes and spending time there is like a punishment then you should probably self study (there is enough material available these days). If you have enough interest in what you are learning then self studying is really fun and plus you get to know if you are actually interested! Stop using reddit if you want to crack jee ."

334,Photography,[SERIOUS] How would people in India react if someone started posting erotic/implied nude photography on Instagram?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dc6k28/serious_how_would_people_in_india_react_if/,"PS: I’m going to be as specific as possible so people here can actually tell how others, specially my friends, college teachers etc might react. I’ve also added serious tag so that the replies don’t turn into sarcastic/joke types. 

I’m an Indian guy in my mid twenties working abroad. I like to do photography as a hobby in my free time although art of any form but mainly paintings and movies have always been something I’ve been very interested in. Lately I started shooting female portraits which involves mostly European and sometimes Asian women. I post all my work on Instagram where my friends and even teachers from school follow me.

So far my friends and colleagues etc have been really appreciating my photos. Some of them were very impressed since I do feel my photos are good and stand out. Surprisingly I’ve received better feedback from my female friends.

Now I’m thinking of starting erotic/boudoir photography which involves women in very less clothing. Some of that also involves nude women where nudity is implied i.e. breasts hidden by hand etc (no frontal nudity). Something along the lines of playboy shoots. I have couple of shoots already planned with two  European girls.

I’m not someone who cares much about what others think but I’m a bit concerned if this is going to have a bad impact on me in any way that I am unaware of. I mean any way this can have a bad effect. In terms of reputation or how people may react or perceive me etc. I’m especially not sure how Indian people would react to this and if I’m going to be viewed in a negative way. Thanks for reading."," They will probably start unfollowing you or whatever it's called. You would probably not be having a straightforward conversation at that with those who find it offensive. I don't think so , Indian hot celebrities already have pics like these.

Make your art , have something unique in it.

People will appreciate. Create a new instagram handle, simple. Also talk to @framesbyankit Ashleel launda h - 3 idiots Mind telling us the insta account might follow u if it's good Logon ka kaam hai kehnaa... So don't worry about that...

Indians society is an epitome of hypocrisy, do what you do. Make your portfolio / career while it's possible. Those who like what you are doing will stick with you and back you.

All the best...
@shrikanthkarri on Instagram Stick to what you enjoy doing. People who will relate to your content will stick and support you.  
And trying new thing brings new opportunity to learn and experiment more. All the best.  
\-  
I left taking portraits when I found my interest in Travel photography. Instagram (@xtermist) I my self am an amateur photographer and I post on Instagram. What my personal thinking is that, only people who are very close to you, like family might feel a bit weird per se. 

But other than that, your friends or people who really appreciate photography should be fine with  it. 

Personally, I don't think I can post any such pictures, I can't even post portraits of my friends smoking because my parents and close family follow me on Instagram. 

In conclusion, I think only your family and maybe teachers (i honestly don't know about them) will react oddly. But if you don't have a problem and want to showcase your are, please do so. It'll be a good experience and if you get negative feedback, you can always stop if you want. 

Hope this helped. 

P.S. Please share your Instagram photography page.

And check my page out 😁 @vmodani.photography Well post you thinking of bringing a bit of change to your style of photography...but whatever you do everyone is going to flip or act weird. 

But your are a photographer and it comes with your job to explore and you should do it. Post on Reddit first"

337,Photography,What is prospect of photography in India?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dn1xda/what_is_prospect_of_photography_in_india/,"I'm a bit above beginner photographer from Ahmedabad and I wish to pursue a career in Photography. I want to find out a few things and I guess India could help me:
1. What are prospects of business?
2. How good is this as a career for not just survivability but to thrive? (I don't want to live in a mansion but yeah in long term a life where I don't have to worry)
3. What are different types of career options like I'm planning to do Product photography but what other than that, Wedding, etc.?
4. I'm about to complete my Bachelor's of Pharmacy (don't ask why Pharmacy, it just happened) but should I go for Masters Degree in Photography, I'm 22 years old.
5. What are good institution for photography courses and how to get an admission in them & other local classes where there are 6 months starter courses?
6. Where and how can I find work?"," I have a cousin who occasionally comes to Bangalore to get her photography taken from brands and freelancers. She’s very into the modeling industry.

She’s had lots of pictures taken, but hasn’t paid even once. One time a photographer traveled for over an hour just so he could take free pictures and put it on his Instagram.
This person as far as I can tell has done this a lot of times to gain some followers.
He still hasn’t succeeded, he still has 800 the last time I checked.

Luckily since he’s been helping out my cousin she started paying him for his pictures. 
I think she paid him 3,000INR for 4 hours of shoot.

It’s hard being a photographer. I reckon that’s the first time he got paid.
Now he seems to be doing fine getting more connections. This took him over a year though.
So it’s hard work and requires lots of traveling.
I haven’t answered your question properly, but hope it helps. If you have any questions let me know I’ll ask and let you know.

As for money, learning to code pays off big time.  I did mechanical and am currently freelancing.
I started off with just HTML, CSS and JS. Which is like majority of the work most clients need.
Currently taking a break to learn a few more skills, and learning to code for these past years has paid off.

Photography is possible as well, but I reckon finding a job is way more hard especially since so many have a Instagram photography page and will do it for free.
I wish you all the best :) [deleted]"

Since my high school, photography is something that has always interested me and made my eyes sparkle in a unexplainable way. Everytime I scroll through Instagram, there is a cry inside me to try to make it as a photographer.

Moreover, as I'm jobless and the chances of getting an engineering job seems slim I am wondering if it is too late to listen to what has driven me since childhood.

Is there any hope for me, and if so, what kind of certifications and courses are needed to be competent?
Or is the risk that I'm taking too huge and should I just stick to finding an engineering job?"," Slog through and get a proper job first side by side do photography. [Don't Follow Your Passion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVEuPmVAb8o) I know some amazing photographers and all of them suggest only one thing, to not take up photography as a career without securing am alternative career path first. The thing with photography is you can become a pro by just being a hobbyist as well, a weekend or two outside and whipping out the camera to take pictures isn't a big deal. Maybe build a portfolio and apply to places first. But do this while you at least have a job. Photography is an expensive hobby. Perhaps consider joining merchant navy and combine your education and passion. Check out videos of [JeffHK](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGpdSarF_FdCygiA1tOl6Cg/videos) \- he does photography and good YouTube videos as a hobby while serving on a merchant vessel. Don't watch 3 idiots in a loop. >Is there any hope for me, and if so, what kind of certifications

You can join photography college/school. There are many. Also look into online classes

If you've a DSLR, try practicing on your own. Shoot in manual. 

Also parallely, learn photoshop/GIMP/Lightroom. People find it tough. But post-processing is necessary specially when shooting Raw."

Then they will post a hundred irrelevant messages and wishes

Then the manager will travel abroad and post a bullshit picture in the group

After that everyone will praise the picture and the place

Subsequently they will marvel at the managers photography skills 

Lastly, if you do not partake in these conversations, they will ask you on your face what you were doing over the weekend and why there was no response from your end

Aap chronology samjhiye"," Avoid work WhatsApp groups. Use a prehistoric phone for work and show them why you can't join WhatsApp. That'll shut them up. There is settings in whatsapp to restrict people from automatically adding you into groups I tell people I don't use whatsApp for privacy reasons (Facebook owned etc etc). Some went ahead and asked if 'something happened' :P. Or you can say you dont use it because you feel it takes up too much time. 

if you are wondering, I have all my close friends on telegram (yes they moved for me!.. i feel lucky)

I had to reinstall whatspp recently because 

* i moved to a new country and my parents only know how to use whatsapp
* handy-men (electrisian, painters, drivers etc).

I dont have a dp there and my status is 'Inactive' just to make it easier to tell people that its an old profile and I dont use it anymore. Don't share your WhatsApp number. If you do, just block the request to be added in group and do not entertain such requests in first place. The mediocrity will pull you down to their level. The mediocre is always looking for these-

More numbers. They want a big group.

Banal talks. They don't talk about anything remotely interesting.

Attention and appriciation.

Herd mentality. Everyone should be a conformist.

A dumb leader to praise.

It is not just your office but it is the theme of this country. try to move them over to slack, mattermost or skype. that will keep shit like this to a minimum.

Tell your manager in mattermost or slack it is easier to closely monitor your employees as an incentive to move them over. Man really appreciate that my colleagues don't give a fuck about your personal life. But realising I don't have a personal life, now I think might as well hang out with colleagues who gave a fuck. That's not your office. That's BJP Discord gang rise up!! Sycophancy? I thought it was just called ball-washing. 

It's been going for ages and is here to stay. 

The fake laughter to every botched attempt of the manager's 'humour', forced interest in his/her personal life and stories, the casual ass licks and kisses...corporate life is definitely not for the ones with an ounce of self-respect. Lol man. I remember one message that went - so nice you are, love working with you.

The occassion was the managers birthday Would you be in trouble to name & shame this company? Don't want you to get in any problem but curious to know (so I can stay away). You need to mute that group. I would've if I were you. Lol the moment this group was made I never said a single word. Pretending to not understand how WhatsApp works is so easy to explain. I wont do that. But If feel my manager is doing something stupid I will not tell him.  People like to be praised. This is exactly what used to happen when i was working in Swiggy .. *'tum input nahi dete'* - Le the CBH ...do you work with me? You've just described our work WhatsApp group to a T. >Lastly, if you do not partake in these conversations, they will ask you on your face what you were doing over the weekend and why there was no response from your end

Except for this part, the rest of your comment doesn't really show that it's sycophancy. I don't see anything wrong in complementing a photo posted by anyone of your co-workers or even boss etc or posting wishes and other stuff. Some people are just more extroverted and look to strike a conversation with others so sending wishes and all those other irrelevant groups messages etc.

Lastly, the tone in which they ask you why you don't partake in these conversations matters. If it sounds malicious and threatening then yeah, it's a problem. If not, then you've got issues(you're at best slightly anti-social and probably an introvert) and you're seeing too much into it. They're probably wondering why you're so quiet etc and trying to get you to open up more. In the latter case you can just be blunt to them and tell them you don't like the group cuz it's too spammy and leave the group."

361,Photography,Is photography a hobby only for rich guys?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bwz9fd/is_photography_a_hobby_only_for_rich_guys/,"Guys with dads/family to take care of expenses for hifi camera/trips/outings/lighting equipment and what not ? Is there a story where a dude/dudette worked hard, got a camera on his/her own savings and the started pursuing it as a hobby? I would love to hear what you guys think. I might come off as rude and cynical but this thought has been bugging me for some time now."," My colleague, a lookdev artist used to quote:   
""Camera is a mere tool, it's the eyes and brain behind it that matters"".   
    
That dude had a beautiful photo blog, with pictures shot on a 3 megapixel, point and shoot camera.  
    
    
Photography used to be a rich guy's hobby before the digital age. 
We used to shoot carefully to use one single roll for our college assignments.  
Every wasted frame was crime. It depends.

 I personally believe that a lot of beginners just get great equipment and the camera does everything, they're satisfied. They crank up the focal length and blue the background, and suddenly call it great photography.

Crystal clear photographs != good photography. 

A good photography depends highly on the composition of the image, a sort of mood that it evokes. I know that it sounds kinda pretentious, but that's what I believe it is. I used to do casual photography, nothing great, and to date my favourite photograph is one which I clicked on my phone.

That being said, entry DSLRs cost around 25-26k and they're more than enough to get you started with photography. Everyone is a photographer these days. So unless it's a hobby you are committed to, and you know your stuff, don't spend money. You get decent cams everywhere. Also every chutiya these days has a camera around his neck if you walk around. Learn composition and lighting. Then comes the resolution and sharpness.

Most people do not learn composition or lighting. I have a Canon 5D, Mark III, Nikon entry level DSLR, a Canon point and shoot digital camera and an iPhone XR. Guess which one I use for photography nowadays. My phone. I rarely take out the other equipment because my iPhone (or for that matter any smart phone) lets anyone to take great pictures by fine tuning the aperture, exposure and shutter speed and what not. And then you have a myriad apps to do post processing. 

So yeah, once upon a time photography was a rich person’s hobby but it is anyone hobby today and there are a gazillion places to learn, fine tune the pictures and showcase your photos... so no, photography is anything but a rich person’s hobby.
P.S. don’t get me wrong, costly equipment makes a lot of difference but remember, today’s smart phone can do ten times more than any camera did twenty years ago so the limiting factor is your mind. Not the damn camera. Camera saste me dilwao toh humara bhi angle and perspective mast hai."

367,Photography,Visiting India,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/es78p7/visiting_india/,"Hello everyone,

I am going to be visiting India soon for a business trip. I will be meeting up with our business friend, which is the reason for my visit. We will be in New Delhi, and I just have some random miscellaneous questions and I would enjoy talking to actual Indians instead of reading someone's travel blog. Above all, I want to make sure I'm not disrespectful to anyone.

Firstly, I am interested in doing some photography of my time here, both of the incredible buildings and of the culture. Is it considered disrespectful to do what we call ""street photography"" which is essentially taking pictures of the things, buildings, and people while walking around? What is the locals attitude towards a white guy like me walking around taking photographs?

Secondly, what are some good places to visit near New Delhi? I believe we will be going to the taj Mahal, and I would also like to go to red fort, humayuns tomb, etc. I know these are touristy, but I'm coming across the world and would like to see them.

If anyone has any questions for me I'd love to talk as well, it's always interesting to learn about others culture."," Hey, welcome to India. You don't have to worry about street photography in India because people will come to you for selfie for sure. 

You are coming at right time. The weather is good, you can enjoy the food. Go to food streets, Taj Mahal (drive in afternoon), gardens, historical sights, India gate and more. Feel free to msg if you need any more detailed info. Hi, Welcome to India! I hope you have a great trip here, apart from business.
As such, I do not think you would have issues doing street photography, people generally do not mind. If you think someone would mind, just let them know - and they will tell you if they don't want. I guess it would only be women being photographed that you need to worry about. Mostly, be careful of your gear in public to avoid something getting stolen.
Buildings can be photographed, as long as they are not government buildings, which may land you in a soup. Some historic places require separate tickets for professional photography, be sure to buy that. Also, if someone heckles you over rules, stand your ground. People do this for money, but don't mean to hurt.
Please be vigilant while you travel specially in public transport. 
In Delhi, Red Fort, Qutab Minar, Rashtrapati Bhavan, Jana Masjid, Akshardham are must visit. You can also do Agra for Taj Mahal, Fatehpur Sikri. Jaipur is also a short distance from Delhi, with great forts to visit.Golden temple in Amritsar is also very good option. It maybe be best if you can take a local along. Tourist places can be mad crowded.
Visit old Delhi for street food delicacies. If this is your first visit, bring a strong stomach and the food will not disappoint you. I guarantee.
Let us know how it went. Enjoy! Welcome! 

It's completely okay to take pictures, and if you're not too shy, it's completely okay to dance like a maniac, roll on the streets, whatever. If you're comfortable around people different from you, people might even interact in funny ways, ask for pictures with you, stare, etc. etc.

It's going to be very crowded, possibly polluted. Very hot, unless it's within a month from now. 

Places are qutb minar, red fort, etc. etc. just try to be assertive so as to not get fleeced, and preferably go early morning to avoid the traffic, if it's not to hazy for your pictures.

You can't do anything disrespectful to them. only in temples, you have the be barefoot, sometimes cover your head, sometimes photography not allowed, but you will get to know about all that there itself. Beware of shoe stealers, pickpockets, all that jazz. Very common. And no need for the namaste's, they never happen. Delhi is capital and crowded and is coldest in 100 years , and these all in delhi monument can be done in one day , my advice is to book a cheap flight and go to south where the good weather is , andaman or kerela see the natural beauty and good weather ,avoid north at this time as it is very cold

If not then just go to agra for tajmahal and if possible jaipur to ahve good photography"

NDMC and other civil authorities could also ask for money that covers cost of such event held in a public place and the cleanup required afterwards. This is what I hate about us Indians. :(

On the other hand, I would like to share that I have seen sikhs doing langar sewa and cleaning afterwards. Everyone should learn from them. This is the situation post any celebration... be it a festival or a wedding or a party
Long way to go.... Bitch please this is nothing. There are fucking dead goats around my neighborhood. Stupid superstitious bullshit. Disappointing Why haven't been these bloody thermocol plates banned yet!! OP was there a dustbin in the vicinity? SwaCh bhaarat!  [deleted] Though our Indian fellows are slow in learning civic duties, it happens almost everywhere, where there is a large gathering except in case of Japanese people.

Do you think we have any less crowd in durga puja than a concert?

 Absolute NO.  Needs #swacchbharat flair Saaddi dilli Beautiful Makes me remember the news article where the Bangladeshi fans were cleaning the stadium after the match in UAE.

This happens with Japanese and Korean football fans as well This is swach Bharat. We could take a cue from the Japanese who apparently never fail to clean up after themselves at public events: 

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-44492611 Humans will never learn. Swacha bharat... Lol To kya Durga Puja Band kar den? Bhagwan ki Shraddha mein aisi chhoti chhoti pareshani to hogi hi. Learn to deal with it. What's the proof that this is Delhi? And that this was taken after Durga Puja and not some other event? The problem with these occasion's is that they dont provide a trash bin where people can throw the plates. So people just throw it on the street."

But eight-hour shoots. Sigh. Haha bichu This article is hilariously depressing. Why keralites are so obsessed with this cringy photo shoots , don't get me wrong out of 10 such pre wedding photography , atleast 6 of them would be from Kerala or Punjab. There is a youtube black hole ""Kerala wedding videos"". Recently I saw one with guy and girl on a helipad with wind blowing and stuff. Looks like shot on a drone but couldn't figure out where the photographer was standing. It was seriously some bollywood level choreography.  Water conservation just went up the arse I can't believe they wanted to stand around for 8 hours after a tiring  8 hours. Some shoots are tolerable, while others are cringy AF with slow mo etc... I feel this hoopla around pre-wedding shoots, honeymoons, likes on social media etc. take away people's thoughts from real feelings and intentions w.r.t. marriage.  What happened to fake rain for Delhi? I have seen quite a few drone videos of Telugu pre-wedding shoots. Didn't know it's a big thing in Kerala as well. If everyone is happy, good for them. Validation from social media. It's huge now.
Birthdays, wedding and even funerals.  Seen quite a few pictures of dead bodies kept as whatsapp/instagram status just minutes after the demise. 

Pre-wedding photoshoots are supercringe.

You know what's even more hilarious. There are 15-20 minutes long pre-wedding videos with Bollywood stories and Bollywood songs uploaded on YouTube."

Are there any good upcoming Photography workshops/talks/courses,etc?",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bm2lmt/photographers_of_india_i_need_photography/,"3 questions :
1. Which DSLR Camera to invest in?
2. Photographers who can guide and help me through, I am willing to assist and work under you. (I will be staying in Mumbai in the month of June.)
3. Any workshops/talks/courses I can attend? 


Ping me if you are experienced and could discuss this with me. 

Hi! I am a 20 year old. I am very interested in Photography and I would like to engage more systematically in it. I am a beginner.
I would like to invest in a good DSLR camera as I don't own one yet. Someone who could guide me on that and also take me through things on beginning in this field. I would like to intern under someone as an assistant so I can get exposed to the on field working and learn practically.


I am passionate about capturing anything evoking an emotion. I believe myself to have an eye for detail and an active observer of everyday little things. I like to document them. 
As of now I have just tried my hand in Phone Photography and uploaded pictures on my Instagram. The photos I click are sometimes personal to what I relate to and often open to interpretation.

Thank you for reading! Please help me out."," Don't know where you are from, sorry, but this field is really, really overbooked.

For me, a single photographer has no future in India, my best advice will be : make a team and join an elder. 

Internship will be more than free when actual photography already charges very low fees.

I know because i tried myself in Bangalore and most of the people do shooting for free to build their portfolio so most of customers expects very low budget with best gear.... so it takes years to refund materials.

Doesn't make sense. 

&#x200B;

Second and last advice : be the best at postproduct (LR and PS) Take this question to [jjmpf](http://www.jjmehta.com/forum/index.php) as well. Too many people interested in Photography especially those in college.

So your best bet is to take some good photographs which you clicked and send it to a potential guide.

Also post the pictures on instagram (Have a proper account dedicated to photography), a lot of people I know were recognised for their talent sooner or later this way."

380,Photography,I started my Btech degree yesterday at the age of 25.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ciddbn/i_started_my_btech_degree_yesterday_at_the_age_of/,"For those who are ashamed of going for their bachelor's after the age of 21, I started my btech degree at the age of 25. Sure the Indian society looks down upon you and laughs at you and education isn't encouraged at such ""old age"" by societies standards, but I took the plunge. Here's my backstory - I graduated high school in 2012. Scored a rank of 718 in Wbjee 2013 and took up chemical engineering at Jadavpur University. My father lost his job in 2014 due to mental illness and I had a passion for photography. I started working as a freelancer photographer to meet ends. I couldn't attend classes and by 2015, I had 12 backlogs. I decided to drop out and realised chemical engineering isn't for me. Made some good progress in my photography career. Shot few promotional events with Kareena Kapoor,Ajay Devgan,Govinda,etc. But opportunities became bleaker as I didnt have the money to expand on my equipments and upgrade and hence by 2017 photography was totally a failure. People suggested me to go back and finish my degree. My cousin sponsored my studies and I went back to JU, but I hated chemical engineering. Depression happened and by mid 2018 I had 22 backlogs. I wasnt just simply interested in it. Took the year off to recover from my depression, gave wbjee this year and now I am starting a btech in cse from a tier-3 college. So by the time I graduate I will be 29.
I really love front end web development at the moment. So let's see where the future leads me. A lot of you might ask, why I am going for a bachelor's degree, I could have learnt coding and got a job in six months. Honestly, there are no shortcuts in life. I wouldn't want to be a 35/40/50/60 year old who lost his job and is unemployable now just because he doesn't have a bachelor's degree. 
I have seen a lot of posts here by people who are 24-30 and non graduates and they ask for help. This is for those people, even if society makes u feel like a failure, don't let your mind accept that. Because, u can't change your past, but you can plan and act in the present to build a better future. Dwelling on the past won't change anything. I saw lots of posts from people in their mid 30s to 50s on Facebook job post groups, where they took up a job(without going for a graduation degree) and now at a much older age they are without any job and much options. A smart man learns from his own mistakes, a wise man learns from the mistakes of others. I don't know why our society stigmatises going back to school at an old age, but in USA people graduate even in their 50s. Age is just a number, don't let society come in between your life and your dreams. Failure isn't fatal, Success isn't final. It is the courage to go on that counts. Don't let the past define you. Today is a new day. Start again :)


Thanks,


Failure at 25.

I hope this post can give people a new direction and courage. Don't lose hope. You aren't alone.

Edit 4 : Thanks for the 4th silver. I have received a lot of messages with similar problems to mine and asking for guidance. If you are someone, who is reading this and you are stuck in a similar situation, feel free to message me for any queries/advice/motivation."," More power to you bro. Wish you all the best! [deleted] 25 is still an early age. I've known a lot of people who went to college in their 30s and are doing quite well.

Just make sure you use what you learn and build useful things. Congrats on bouncing back! Also, just remember that majority of Indian engineering institutions are filled with professors who have no idea about the industry. Unless you're lucky, you'll mostly only end up with a useless degree at the end of 4 years. Just keep learning new things on the side and build a few pet projects for your resume. Just my two cents. You are an inspiration bro. Just one thing, don't wait for graduation to start earning money. Learn new things and start doing freelance work. When I was in college, the schedule seemed so hectic that I didn't find any time to do anything apart from study and a little sports. But now in job, I realize I had a lot of free time then and could really do better things than just wasting it on bakar. Do competitive programming, contribute in open source, pick relevant projects, maintain a good github profile and take up online courses on new technologies. You have a unique advantage of maturity that most of your batchmates don't. Perspective changes with age and there's more clarity on what to choose based on how much value it's gonna add. Use that advantage. You know there are millions of people who wish they could redo their college days with the same level of maturity and wisdom that they have now and you my friend are living their dream. So keep the motivation up and make the best out of these four years that you have. That's such an inspiring journey .. imo opinion failures are necessary for success .. those who succeed without failure cannot grasp the true value of achievements Better late than never. I was feeling quite anxious today about my career and I am just 21. Just graduated, dropped CA, picked up CFA. 
Now I've been applying for jobs and so far not much has happened. I was feeling defeated but I guess we only lose when we  stop trying. 
More power to you, to me and everyone who needs. 

You'll land on your feet because you are willing to work and that's what matters at the end of the day. Fellow front-end dev here. Hit me up for any sort of help at any time! Please get scientific paper published by the end of your [B.Tech](https://B.Tech). Contribute to open source projects. These are my suggestion. A good career awaits you. You shall be inspiration for others and me. Let me know If i can help you in any way. Good luck!!! I wish there is someway I can reach out to you and hang out.     

I am also from JU - I started my undergrad in a crappy engineering college at Bangalore. I loved Bangalore, loved Kannada people but hated engineering and the college. I grew up in Jodhpur Park - right next to Jadavpur University. I even had ice cream when the chemical engineering department used to make them as an experiment? I think it was the chem engg dept but I could be wrong. You were probably in first year when I was in PG1.   

I did not face any of the adversities that you do - not even half of them. As I read your post, I realized how privileged a life I have had.    

None the less, dropped out of engineering - joined JU Arts. As much as people hate on JU arts - they are the most liberal people I have seen. There was a senior in the faculty who was also an engineering dropout and he would reach out to every dropout who came to JU arts and encourage them. Mind you there were plenty and weird as it may sound all of them are doing so well in their lives now!   
 
Anyways, JU arts turned it around for me. I did decently there, went onto get 2 masters and then finally into a PhD which I am hoping to graduate next year. I am 31 now and ironically I code for statistical analysis now. I had dropped out of CSE engineering and the only difference is I like what I do now.   

The moment I read JU, I hoped JU would be the turning point for you - just as it was for me. But we all have our own stories and our own journeys to take.   
 JU is and will remain my alma mater and anyone who is remotely connected to the institution as a student is nothing but family.     

Don't let people tell you what to do and how to do it. I have had really stupid people both in JU and mostly outside tell me that I would amount to nothing  - because I dropped out and because of my age. Bro, I started my PhD at 27 - two students I met in my cohort 1. An American African woman aged 41 2. A White gentleman aged 55 who had just retired from American Army. These two were older that most of the cohort which was by average 35 years old and what a bloody inspiration they were to the PhD cohort. PhD cohort's have a pretty high dropout rate but the gentleman was one of the few full time students who cleared the qualifiers at one go, especially the econometrics paper. While the lady was not that good at maths, she fought on and eventually cleared both the theory and econometrics paper. They outworked younger candidates like me and brought in all the experience they had gathered to research projects. I ended up being really good friends with both of them. In fact they are the closest friends I have on campus. So no, age is honestly a number and nothing else - fight the good fight!  


If you ever feel like talking to someone or hanging out - please reach out to me! This was actually my last summer break here in the country and I will be in Philadelphia for most of the graduating year but if there is anything I can help you with - please reach out! I am more than happy to hang out as long as am in the country.   

And again - fight the good fight, I am sure you will do great.   
I leave you with a song that I used to listen to when I got depressed in JU about my career trajectory. The song was an anthem for us dropouts - Pulak da wrote the song. Pulak da was from Philosophy department and died in a road accident. I thought you might like this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVmqXFJtN-A It’s never too late to do anything. Good luck 👍 That's some really inspiring material for someone who has done engineering and pursuing first year masters in psychology at the age of 24. Late bloomer but I'll surely gonna have a great career ahead Wise man learns from others' mistakes. So here's a mistake I made that you could learn from. In my graduation, all I did was try and pass exams. I did well in grades, but in terms of learning or knowledge, I didn't have much. So I had to go back to basics after my degree. Don't do this. Please take keen interest in your classes, curriculum, and additional learning. Don't be just a literate, be an educated person. All the best :) More power to you, bro! Sotti khub bhalo lagche eita porey!
I hope you become really big in life. Thank you for inspiring us to work a little harder. It's awesome you chose this for yourself! Never be ashamed to choose education especially when life takes away opportunities  from you unexpectedly. You had the chance to grow and you took it. That's a win in my book.
My father had taken up bsc in physics and chemistry when he was 16 because my grandfather wanted that for him. He had wanted to do b.tech right after his bsc degree but my grandfather passed away unexpectedly. My father was financially burdened at 18 yrs of age to take care of my grandmother and his 4 unmarried sisters.
He could never pursue b.tech again and its his biggest regret in life. 
Don't listen to society and do your own thing. All the best! >Shot few promotional events with Kareena Kapoor,Ajay Devgan,Govinda,etc. But opportunities became bleaker as I didnt have the money to expand on my equipments

Most of my photographer friends are facing this issue too. They have tried to get endorsed by brands. But only a few succeeded. Tough career path.

Anyways happy for you. This post motivated me to get up and fucking study while I've time. I'm a bit depressed regarding the backlogs in my masters. Hope to get over it soon. Great for you bro. 

I don't think you'll need it but if you want any advice on frontend web-dev, just PM me, been doing it for two years.. Thanks man, your post was really encouraging, as someone who failed in previous master program and trying to go back to another master program, I really needed this. You are doing a good job going back to your bachelor's studies. 

Everyone should remember, not everyone's situation is the same to graduate by 21 and achieve everything in life. 

Life is not a straight line. Question : What you do for living? I started college in 2013 when I was 18 I got Btech IT by 22 I had lost interest in most things was probably depressed and also took the bold decision to drop out of college instead of giving make up exams because of  very low attendance coz I was busy playing dota and other games,drinking,rolling and watching every fucking TV series  now 2 years later beyond the depression and being looked down upon I feel ok the first year after dropping out was he'll coz I didn't have any friends back in hometown and my parents kept telling at me all day to learn my dad's work and look after it.i used to think how fckin shit I was couldnt do Btech , anyone can do Btech these days wtf, slowly I started going outside doing some of my dad's work made friends.im 24 now and life is better I still think about my fucked up life decisions.i dunno if I'll ever go back to get some degree but thanks for the motivation. Small milate jao, large banate jao Thanks for being an inspiration man. For many wonder only few do. 24 year old here... gonna start my masters in Computer Applications or get into Med School.

&#x200B;

I was the guy who had been completely destroyed by depression. I passed my +2 in 2013 and even after 6 years, I was unable to join any college.

&#x200B;

This year, I have come out with flying colours.. so much so that my family is baffled.

&#x200B;

Never Give Up!

&#x200B;

I hope you achieve the dreams you're striving for. thanks bro , i am struggling with CA at the age of 27.
i was confused tensed dont know wt to do but your post was a welcomed perspective to me thank you 
Godspeed to you bro !! People like you are rare who build themselves. You are destined for something big in a unprecedented future. I can't say where you are going to reach, but your spirit is telling me you're going pretty far. Oh wow this is my favorite post. Thanks for sharing it with us.

Jk, Good luck bro. I wish u all the best. bhaii jo sahii lagta haii wo kar; bhaad mein jaye duniya [deleted] [deleted] Best of luck bro. Best of luck! Stick in there. Did you consider opting for an open university course, like IGNOU? Good luck.. Congratulations!!!! I am your same age, I dropped out of BDes in the first year in 2012. I did BCom on correspondence and now I'm going to do my Masters! 

When I did start my BDes course, I had at least 3 other people who had done their BTech and then come for BDes. They were 24-25 at the time and it wasn't the least bit weird. they fit right in, we loved their input and ideas. You'll be that person in your college! 

You'll have more worldly experience, more stories to say and hey you can act 20 years old and thatll be okay! (I still act like that sometimes when I say stupid things and jump around like a kid) 

Good luck on your degree! All the best buddy!

I don't know if I can be of any help to you, but just wanted to let you know that I have been a developer for about 5 years now, so if you need any help in knowing about any learning resources, or getting something done, or just general industry trends in the field, I just might know a few things that maybe of use to you.

I'll always be happy to help! Brave move man. best of luck. Myself 22 and having a 2 year gap after ug preparing for competitive exams. Quick! Get some experience and money then begin a IT start up. The only thing I can tell you is that just dont depend on degree, get your CERTIFICATES with proper training.

I don't know much about the current requirements and trends in IT field but as far as I know, go for AWS. That's the beauty of Computer Science.Any body can learn and code!There are no boundaries , no silos , no walls.Kudos to you for dusting off and getting back on your feet.Remember,no one is bothered that you have lost time,it's only you against your past. Check out this roadmap\[1\] what you need to learn to get a good internship but this is no way an exhaustive list but from my experience this good enough to get a decent internship focus more on projects and attend hackathons.

I am currently doing my Btech I don't have any backlogs but my GPA isn't good either, I am too afraid I won't get a job. Bhai lore jao.. Jaa hobe dekha jabe... Enjoy Can people without a degree get a job in web development in India?? If so is there growth for him in that job? I have seen a lot of blogs about getting a job (in developed countries) in computer science field without a degree but how much of it is true in India?? Can someone working or hiring answer this please? Hats off man. I'm sure you will succeed at anything you try if you apply yourself. You have the brilliance and even more importantly the determination not to give up. Best wishes. Good Luck!! Best of luck buddy. It's really good to see that you have taken that step, wish you all the best for your future, but at the same time i feel that if you are planning to take web dev as a career option then there are many certifications out there, for which you have to attempt examinations, going to college for 4 years seems like a huge burden to me apart from that college is expensive as fuck.

However i will also say, you know more than me, I am just a teen here with 0 life exp. but thought this could be a better option MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU.... A thought out focused attempt at 25 is far far better then a attempt at 18 which is everything but focused. Apna time apne pace le chalta hain, don't let anyone shame you on that. Good luck Only in India people fucking expect you to start engineering right after school. I think we should all take time and pursue after giving it a thought. I saw this video on Harvard law school where this girl used to do a job and only after proper thinking she decided to pursue law because she loved it. This was uplifting! All the best You are very courageous dude. I wish you success and I hope you didnt completely drop photography. All the best brother. Fuck what they think. Dude cheers! For fighting depression and staring once again. Only strongest can do. Thanks for sharing this and wish you all the best bud! > I really love front end web development at the moment.

I'm a frontend developer. If you need any sort of help, I'll be happy to do it. All the best buddy :) You're amazing. I'm doing my post grad right now. I was already a year older than majority of my classmates in school. And I took a drop last year. The thought of me being a couple of years or maybe even 3 years older than my classmates, was in the back of my mind. &nbsp;

This post is improving my confidence. &nbsp;

I wish you the best OP. All the best OP. This is, of course, is big call in the context of our society. Hope it pays off for you. You know you'll be at an advantage compared to others because of the added maturity in mindset and approach you might take in studying. Wish you the absolute best, bro. Wish u all the best Thank you for this post. I wish you good fortune in the wars to come.

This was like a slap in the face. The mistakes that you mentioned people make, I've made them all and then some. Whereas you've overcome your situation with determination, I had slipped more into  depression due to my failure. Now I feel old and not ready to start anew. I confess that this post will not fill me with new energy but I will wholeheartedly pray for your success. you will be more mature and will waste less time. and am here 22 think too old to get education dont have any degree only high school pass wanna study something but still dont know what should i study.

Don't let this determination in you fade ever! :D Great man Good luck man I'm 40 and I never went to college. It made no difference. You just need to recognise that a degree and education are different things. Don't let the fear of not having a degree be your primary motivator. Good luck and happy hacking :) Hey bro, let me start by saying that you're doing an incredible job completing your graduation. With that said, I'm sorry about your father and I hope he's doing okay now.
I was pursuing Btech in Chemical Automation and Diagnostics, dropped in my third year 2013, was 22, started with B.Com this year, would be 29 when I graduate, so I'd say I'm pretty much in the same boat as yours. I'm still trying to figure out what should I do in regards with my career, but in the meanwhile picked up SQL, now preparing for MTA and JLPT N3, both of which I'll attempt next year.


>Failure at 25

FWIW, you're definitely not a failure, for, I know you'll make it big very soon. All the more power to my man! God speed to you. This post should be posted in r/getmotivated as this is what real motivation is. Brother, here's hoping for a great future! That attitude in our society is such bullshit. When I was in the US, I encountered so many >25 year olds and even 30 and aboves who had enrolled into business school or engineering school just because they couldn't do it earlier or because they just wanted an additional skill in their reportoire.

Absolutely nothing wrong with that.

Kudos to you man and best of luck! [deleted] You gonna be fucking happy in 4 years. [deleted] And here I was being depressed because I couldn't get into IIT ..... Great work man.... Keep it up You did right thing bro.
Let me know if you ever need any career advice on software engg. I wish you the very best... You are an inspiration to human being..
👍👍 Good luck bro you will do awesome in life keep learning You go! 

Remember it needs a lot of guts to go against the conventions set by society, you will definitely do something big in the future!

May God Bless you! feel you bro!. I'm in the same boat. Passed 12th in 2014,failed in physics theory. Couldn't clear my 12th and neet in later years too cuz instead of study I used to smoke weed later on Charas till LCD+had lots of issues with myself too until 2018,appeared for 12th again from State board. Took admission in tier 3 college for botany(H) at the age of 22. I feel like a shit most of the time,lots of advice went unheard from my side cuz I wanted to do me,tried not to keep regrets. Funny I did ended up taking up bsc course that my dad said I should've taken,wasted my time. So I feel I've failed them and my only option for me to make it up to them is to qualify some government exams, hopefully UPSC,IFoS. But it's scary in comparison to medical lookin' for job prospect in botany cuz I don't know what too look,where to look,all I've ever seen a botany graduate that they end up in teaching jobs and plus given my history and age I might not be able to score some decent job,everyone around me has completed their study doing job while I'm still studying,it sucks. Well I don't know what future holds for me but meanwhile i'm focusing on what's infront of me,slowly building. I'm still learning to believe in myself and trust my abilities. Rest I leave upto universe, dont know where it will but I have gotta put effort into it.

Sorry for any mistakes,i'm not really good at grammar portion of english,I can just make sentences that make sense in my head😬  Due to financial conditions, I have to do teaching job after my masters and have to be a private teacher for more than a year until I collected enough money for my B.Ed. Many batchmates of mine have commplised many things now but here I am fighting my own battle. All the best! I needed this kind of motivation badly. All the best for the future 👍 this post needs an award!Proud of you brother,it takes courage and i can relate to this as i have been going through a similar phase..All the best! Doing this requires courage. I am glad you shared your story. This is inspiring :) 
ALL THE BEST!!!

My brother is in the same boat as you are. Although he is just 22. He qualified JEE in 2017, but decided that engineering was not his cup of coffee and wanted to study law. He tried those exams as well and got into a decent college, but 2 years down the line he started questioning his decision... He had interest in computer science as well and he used to code sometimes even when he was pursuing law. 

Now when he started to realize that law was not for him, we discussed a lot, pros and cons of this decision and he decided he wants to pursue computer science. So he started college yesterday. Best of luck bro. Fuck the society and go for what you feel is the best for you. I can so relate to the fact that it is expected to do all things in a certain pattern and by a certain age. Hope you succeed and do well! This post is proof that you don't need a degree to be educated. This post made my day. 
Wishing the best for you! 
You’re awesome! ♥️ Well, there's a Master's candidate at my University who has a daughter doing her bachelor's Best of luck friend Indian society is full of fucking wankers. Forget about them and pursue what you desire. The only opinions that matter are those of the ones you love. Nobody cares what the society thinks. Kudos for taking the plunge. All the best! Kudos to you my man. Such an inspiring story. 

I too studied chemical engineering, though not at 25. It wasn't for me either and I ended up depressed. Took a year off after bachelors and am gonna study physics now. 

I could learn a thing or two from you. Keep up your spirit and fuck the naysayers. You made my day⊂(◉‿◉)つ Bookmarking this. Best of luck in life bro. Congratulations to you for making such a bold move. To do what you are doing certainly requires courage. You are an inspiration to the young generation that gives up their life over some petty issues. And the society we live in is also kinda judgmental. Having said that, you must be receiving support as well.Now that you are embarking on new journey of your life, wish u all the happiness and luck. You go man.. ain't no shame in pursuing what you want to.. good luck.. I would say you could have done a 3 year BSC or BCA instead of BTech from a tier 3 college. You could have saved some money and a graduate degree one year early. Then again more power to you for doing something what you like. Great attitude man, our society adds unecessary stigmas to everything, just do what you are doing and don't give a fuck about what everyone else has to say. I takes courage to beat the cliche in this Indian society and pursue what you love. May the force be with you. I am happy for you!!! :D Good Luck. All the Best That was perfect, godspeed. I hope you are successful in all your endeavours. You never failed. You just got a break so that the universe could mold you into a better person. And stop comparing apples with oranges. It doesn’t help. I am glad that you never gave up. ♥️ >  I don't know why our society stigmatises going back to school at an old age, but in USA people graduate even in their 50s. 

That's not a valid comparison. India education system is all handholding and spoonfeeding. Great going dude. Keep it up👍🏻 Just applied for MBA in correspondence, there is no age to learning, Your doing the correct thing, All the best bro!!! First year is the toughest so focus on clearing them, after that you can apply for internship/ job at local web development firms. 
As your college is tier 3, they won't mind your job as their main concern is fees, they'll let you attend job without problem. 
I am asking you do job is because industry experience is highly appreciated by MNCs and also because tier 3 colleges don't provide the required guidance and are far away from realities of what's going on in the industry. All the very best bro 🤘 All the best brother.  God  bless you on your new path. Chutiya lodo pe dhyan na de, God bless. Good luck. I'm 29, and have backlogs still. Wish I could do something and get a degree soon. 

Keep up the good work bro, more power to you! ✊🏽✊🏽✊🏽✊🏽 Would strongly urge you to learn python and big data. I know you are passionate about front end but to leap to salaries your peers are earning you need to give a chance to technologies which are and will be in demand. Kudos to you for being brave. Thanks for this inspirational post. You have broken the stereotypical lifestyles that most of us lead  and I hope things work our well for you from now on :-) Thank you for sharing this.  Indians need to change this idea of ""this only happens at a normal age"".  Your never too late to start! Good luck! Better late than never, my friend. Sir u are an inspiration for a lot of students out there. I studies subjects in school and college that I had no interest in but had to study cuz i wouldn't be able to find a job with the subjects of my choice. Breaking past the social stigma is a surely a daunting task but not an impossible one. Good luck. Guys if u think the degree matter to do something in life? only positive story i find in this group. i will refer you to big 4 when you graduate. humanity is dying this is inspiration. Well..for all I know if my Jee plan backfires so does my neet  plan..I could still try again GREAT, more courage to you dude. I myself thinking of doing masters in technology, I am past my 30. Never stop learning. Drop me a message if you want to do internship in frontend development. Most of my friends are CTOs and Lead Frontend at various startups, I can get them to give you a solid experience. Good luck on the journey. You sir, is simply the one we want right now.

You are copying something that is much more valuable from the Western culture Brightens my day FULL POWER SCOTTY GET THOSE KLINGONS Thank you for sharing your story, it will surely help me :) Good luck!! you are never too old to learn Dude in all honesty, really proud of you for listening to your heart and taking the proper decision. 25 is young bro! We believe in you my man! Thanks brother for sharing your experiences. My relatives always try to make me feel like a looser when I dropped one year for a better college and try to compare with their son that I used to be one year ahead now I am in the same year as him. :/ Great job brother! All the best to you All the best dude! Hope you’re successful with your degree and in life, in general! As someone who's pursuing CA and is in a similar position, thank you for making this post. If only my relatives stopped pestering my parents about my age and my parents in turn didn't label me as a loser for years, I would've been a different person today. I've literally stopped going out to family functions or keep in touch with such relatives and friends (sadly, everyone) who's only opinion on you is to compare and be judgemental. Reading your post has inspired me to do what I'm doing without paying heed to what society says. After all one has lost only when one gives up. My friend who's in Europe currently for masters said it's common to have students who are 30+ in masters, even bachelor's and nobody blinks an eye.. so unlike our Indian society. I wish you all the best and I hope we make the best out of our respective situations. Thank you so much for this. I recently changed my major in college to economics so I'll have to stay an extra year to be able to complete my credits and honestly I get made fun of a lot for that because I'll be the only one not graduating on time. It made me so happy to see this. Good luck to you too! 25 is a young age! When I was doing my undergrad, over the course of my 4 years, I’ve come across people in their 50s and 60s attending classes and trying to get a degree!
And yeah, they were really good at their work. Read Btech as Bitch, that's all I am 24, and I have enrolled myself into a BA (Economics) course. I dropped out of [B.Tech](https://B.Tech) Mechanical three years back. Reading this gave me hope. Thank you. Wish you all the best with your career! May you get an awesome job after finishing your course. Good for you, age is just a number. Never too late to keep learning.  Forget what society says. If you don't take charge of your life, other people will. Good luck mate. I'm graduating at age 23. Brother! This post of yours right here, this shined a light through my bleak day!

You ARE A CHAMPION!ONE OF THE BRAVEST!Wisest as well!

That must have been a hell of a plunge to take, and you fucking took it!!
I hope you find what you want to do and what you excel in brother!!! Age is a number bro. People around the world go back to college when they feel like it and when they can financially foot the bill.

You will make a better and more mature engineer You are really an inspiration for many people. Even my mother completed her under graduate degree when my elder sister was in 10th standards. She was struggling every now and then to educate us and now we all are earning, she wants to leave her job and pursue more education! After reading your post, it's proved once again that to get knowledge-age does not matter! I don't have any rewards, but here is your gold! 🥇 I don’t have an award so here you go. All the best, sir.

Never feel down, brother. And if you ever do, hit me up in the PM's, I'll be there to talk to you.

P.S. - Saved this post to track your progress, do give us updates! r/india itself has a big comp sci grad population to ask to if you need help I'm proud of you, macha. Please don't delete this post, cause I've saved it and I want to look back at it from time to time for inspiration. You are on your own timeline, no one matters.
I messed up my first try at B.tech(Completely my fault. I fucked up big time.) I turned my life around when I was 21, joined a 3rd tier college, completed b.tech Cse this year, got placed in Mindtree. TCS, Wipro did not let me sit on campus drive for my gap years. I had three other offer letters except Mindtree, now looking forward to excel myself more.

All the best to you. It's  good to hear that you're from West Bengal, are you Bengali too? Bring future awaits my friend Good luck Bhalo laglo eta pore! Egiye jao bro Man you just motivated me to prepare for NEET again just as I made up my mind to give up. Our life should not be scheduled according to our age as societal norms force us to do. May you succeed in all your endeavors. ✌☮ And I'm a retard who took a drop from 12th last year... I laugh at it now XDD but I think whatever happened... happened for a reason now I'm completing 12th this year and boy the maturity i feel now towards study is unmatchable by a regular 16-17yr old 12th student. Man, I love seeing posts like this on this sub. You are part of the new India which looks beyond judging people for things like going back to school. Good luck! I hope you enjoy what you do and never regret any of it. Just finished my first year of undergrad. Turned 24 during it. Yes, fucking cunties and cuntkles talk, but fuck them man we got this. 

All the power to you dude, good to know there's more of us around :D Just want to say, I started school at 23 after a not so good 18-23. 25 now graduate next fall. Just keep with it. Make friends, have fun. Its ok to have fun but don't be stupid. Indian here in America, I am about to graduate with my bachelors at the age of 25. I definitely understand the pressure of not being graduated especially in the Indian circles. That’s mostly why I choose not entertain the people who judge me. Those that mind don’t matter, those that matter don’t mind 😊 Ganbarimasu, senpai! I'm finishing it at 28 🙌👏 Your moto is your username 😂, have a great college life bro Best of luck to you man.Depression is one hell of a thing to get through.Stay strong buddy ✌️ You've got photography basics clear, use that to be a developer who writes code with design sense. Example, coding for apps about photo filters...(even courses like image processing from electrical department would help)  Or more generically, even front end designing could be your thing. You don't necessarily need to take it as fresh start. Use your past. More avenues will be visible once you connect these things.

Being a master's dropout, i think I'm able to learn more without college (also saving on money if that's a factor). Yes, job hunt will get difficult... which is why make a coherent story (you got curious about designing while being a photographer and decided to work on that skill.)

Still, given that you have a different pace/way, no need to get more societal validation in form of degree. Save that course money and spend it on your own thing. Because you're picking CSE, this particular skill can be easily learnt from internet. 

I'm almost saying- why give more chance to education system that failed to empathize first time? (However much you think it was your fault, it wasn't). The system is still the same. Use your time to do plenty other things in the world. [deleted] Doing my post graduation at the ripe age of 35, I can totally relate. Feel like a fish out of water. Other than what your studies , get into the open source world. Start understanding programming concepts, try building some stuffs on your own, post them to GitHub. Rinse and repeat. 

For any help related to programming or web development in general you can reach out to the below communities.

/r/webdev
/r/programming
/r/learnprogramming I have finished both my gold and silver. Else this would have been my proud gilding. All the best brother. I am a CSE graduate from a tier 3 private college in kolkata and trust me when I say this: the placement scenario here is not at all good, largely due to the quality of faculty and poorly structured WBUT/MAKAUT curriculum, which in turn translates to poor quality students, hence do not rely on college placements. If you're interested in coding and comp sci in general, explore outside the curriculum (be active on hackerrank, spoj, explore ML, Blockchain, contribute to open source projects and so on). Doing so would help you make it to the bar of the top product companies which pay much better and have a lot better work than the mass recruiting companies that hire from these colleges. [deleted] You are actually in quite an envious position. You are much more mature than the other graduates, you know the world out there so I don't think you would be negligent in your studies. I would say go give it your all and all the best! 

P.S - I would suggest you get started on your studies now, it would be really easy to score an awesome job right after graduation of you start now. Pick up competitive programming or anything... Try freelancing, try out everything. That's a great achievement . Wish you more bright days in life . Fuck Indian society [deleted] I'm an engineering dropout, I've missed out three years there, I can totally feel you bro, love and support, you'll be doing great for sure. Keep boosting up I went to college after a 2 year gap after my 12th and had a lot of apprehensions about it so I can only imagine what you’re going through. But over a period of time I met a lot of people and post an initial period of judgment - which I think was more of me being ashamed of my gap than those who I was meeting for the first time ever - I made some of my best friends who made the 4 years some of the best of my life. Long story short, it’s gonna be epic! Good luck :)"
381,Photography,Inside Mysore Palace. [1080*1168] [OC] [Redmi Y2],https://i.redd.it/ikg888gfdv331.jpg,," [Shot a similar pic last month](https://i.imgur.com/Orxr7Q2.jpg) Photography is prohibited inside the Palace. Some high profile kids got into  serious trouble for doing a photoshoot inside. 

If you take pictures, dont post on social media sites. Woah it has some optical illusion going-on on the floor Please post this in r/incredibleindia post it at r/pics DMT palace you mean? ;p Imagine walking down this lane while being high. I went here as a kid, other than the photos as proof I barely remember it. Need to go there once again. We went on a Sunday in December 2018. My companion, who'd been there before, was surprised to see visitors freely photographing the Palace from inside and not being asked to refrain from doing so. So I suppose they've relaxed the rules. I went there on a class trip in 2007 and an artist was repainting the work on the columns. In my broken Hindi I asked if I could help him and he let me. But was unable to get a picture of me painting because of the photography restrictions. afaik clicking pics is prohibited inside that palace. The inside of my sore place looks way......shittier This beauty is unparalleled Hey OP, saw that glass window which looks like nothing is there? On the 1st floor? Where? Beautiful indeed thanks OP Mysore Palace is really beautiful. Great aperture with this phone's camera looking with the picture capability... Nic pic.

Pristine and well maintained legacy ! Nice Palace. i liked it. i love to explore this kind of places. +1 for taking care of the symmetry. Wow this is really beautiful.. love the symmetry Looks like there renovations are finally done. Have to plan a visit soon! 
Beautiful pic OP 👍 Looks like an optical illusion 😅 Omg India is so beautiful Let's see how you make your way outside! great Wow! So Amazing Beautiful. Photography isn't allowed in there mate. 

Delete this post that is so beautiful. Nice pic pal r/trippy r/pics [deleted] /r/ArchitecturePorn It looks awesome WOW.... Wow been there but my pictures are not like this. You should see inside Mysore ass. o: Once upon a time there was great India Mysore 😍 All of you complaining about the processing this has gone through. It doesn’t matter as long as it looks good to the person who shot it. 
Bumping up the exposure and saturation on this gives it life and just look at it as a form of artistic expression. Peace. Great picture buddy 👌🏽 can’t believe it was taken on a mobile phone.

Great work 👍🏽 Kinda hate that everyone who took pictures at this spot in Mysore Palace have 'cut-out' the first arch from the frame. Why -_- Wow!! this beauty is awesome. Really our India is incredible. Fantastic pic. OMG! That looks absolutely stunning... Simply amazing!! Put it on /world subreddit. Let the world know! So now a dslr is replaceable by a ₹8499 phone.

391,Photography,Is analog photography viable in India?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9i0u1m/is_analog_photography_viable_in_india/,"I am planning on getting an analog camera and shooting film. I am on my mission to find a good deal on a film camera but my question is how much will shooting, developing, digitalizing the film will cost? How would you compare the cost to that of a DSLR camera? 

Also, what is the normal price of film rolls? Is buying them in bulk a better option if I'm planning on taking a lot of photos and minimizing cost? And if the analog photography market isn't that great in India, will importing them from outside India be viable?

Thank you very much for your time and effort. Have a good night. "," It's expensive now. They are charging Rs. 200/- or more for developing the film roll alone. Add another Rs. 150/- for the scanning.  Yes, check the JJ mehta forum. There is a small community of photographers who still shoot analog. Analog photography is viable in India but the costs  would be high, it would also depend on where you live. Most shops have gone digital and stopped processing film in many cities, so if you can't find a shop to process the film then there are ways to do it online.

You can get used film cameras in good condition from ebay. There's a store in Bangalore called film foto store, they also have a website through which they sell film rolls, accessories as well as processing. The film rolls are a bit expensive though.  

I've been looking at doing it for sometime now, I'll have to until I can afford to do it. As a profession, no, as a hobby, yes."
392,Photography,Watching movies in India is a truly unique experience.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dcqkjk/watching_movies_in_india_is_a_truly_unique/,"Seriously, there is no dearth of weird shit that can happen. I went to watch Joker in an afternoon show and here is a list of things that happened.

1. Some guys came with Heath Ledger type facepaint and saste ka clown masks. They were denied entry because they didn't have ID to prove they were above 18. This bunch of Joker ""anarchists"" was then seen begging the security to let them in.

2. I overheard a guy was telling his girlfriend that Heath Ledger would make a cameo in this movie. I thought he was pranking her but he seemed to be convinced.

3. Another group of people (who I had the unfortunate experience of sitting next to later) were chanting anarchy slogans as they entered the theater. They were asked to shut up by the ushers. These same bunch proceeded to take videos and photos of ""iconic"" clips from the movie, sometimes with their flash on. Thankfully they were thrown out.

4. Someone's family member apparently died/hospitalized in the climax of the movie and he began crying loudly while on the call. He ran out after a few seconds but some people who were next to him were genuinely confused about whether to ask him to shut up or not.

5. I spotted a celebrity photographer in the theater watching the movie with his wife. I used to love his early work and it sort of inspired me into getting into amateur photography. I was contemplating throughout the movie what I will say to him or will he be cool to take a picture with me etc. I had them locked on while they were exiting and ended up standing right next to them in the dark exit hallway walking out. As I was about to talk to him, he and his wife started having an argument. I just continued walking past them and left thanks to the awkwardness.

Thoughts about the movie? It's great. Just try going for a show where you can avoid the college crowd. Dunno why these people worship The Joker."," We live in a society Is the photographer Auditya of Audi photography by any chance ? I remember watching The Dark Knight in theater, it was mostly empty and my friends were kinda making fun of me for watching comic book movie. From that to Heath Ledger face painted Joker anarchists, I am kinda glad :) Sounds like a fun night! Aur ek main hun jo WAR chala gaya

Sorry dosto Joker ke english subtitles nahi they . Apun partially deaf hai [deleted] Is the film cursed or what. Everyone going there is having troubles. 

Nah nah I think the cinema is cursed.

Or maybe OP is, considering this many unfortunaties happening in one go [removed] Holy shit all of those in a single show? Where is this? hahaha here's what I experienced yesterday watching the movie:

1) dude in front of me got a huge popcorn bucket and well, he annoyed me throughout the movie

2) in this brooding serious movie, bunch of guys and girls howled, whistled and clapped when arthur fleck finally got the joker makeup, and then when he got the bloody smile. I felt like I was watching a Sallu bhai movie

3) girl behind said after the movie ended : DC waale bahut weird movie hi banate hai. No. 3 I hate it when people start making videos of movie to upload to their insta status,  no one f**kin cares what movie you are watching unless it's Mia Khalifa's comeback video playing in imax. 

No. 4. It can legit happen to anyone anywhere in the world but people need to learn the courtesy of going out before taking calls or put the frikkin thing on silent and enjoy the movie I bet /r/bollywood might also like this Whenever I go to watch a CGI-fest at the multiplex, I keep hearing audience on the way extolling how Christopher Nolan is the greatest film director ever. Basic human empathy tells you not to say shut up to someone who is clearly going through sudden emotional trauma. Imagine yourself in his shoes. Other than that, haha. >Dunno why these people worship The Joker.

It's the kind of people who don't get the message from the movie. It's not just Joker though, although he is definitely the biggest idol for the incel culture on the internet. These people also think Rorschach, Tyler Durden, Travis Bickle etc. were the good guys in their movies What the fuck. But you know what, I've watched movies in some shady-ass neighborhoods of North America and some of this applies to those cinemas as well."

If anyone can help that would be amazing"," Really depends on who your client is. I've worked with food stylists who charge 60k/day, but this is in tv commercial work. A hospitality group can afford a decent budget, but a small business type independent restaurant will be much more price conscious.

If you are new to food photography, my suggestion to you would be to be upfront and tell them you haven't done this professionally, which is why you will work with them on pricing, so its fair for both parties. Also drop your regular rates in this conversation to anchor a price point, so that you don't get low balled.

You make your mark in this specialization and charge big ticket prices and you will still get booked, but until that day you do what you need to reach that level. Play the long game, money will come.

*Edit: Just saw you wrote zomato, swiggy. Quote high and wait for counter offer. If they accept without a counter, your quote was too low.* I got in touch with a third party company in Chennai that wanted photogs to go around and take pics for Swiggy in Chennai,  They pay was 350 bucks per restaurant and  I had to shoot 3 restaurants a day along with 14 or more pics per restaurant.  That amounted to 1050 bucks a day and that doesn't even cover the cost of a days rental for my camera, so I politely told them to fuck off."

 LOL news of the day. I considered python to be most useful language for scientific research. in b4 'we invant' True. Just like Urdu is important for space travel. 
/s Phir shuru ho gaye bhencho. Yeh saaley thaktey nahin hein is sab chutiyappe se? Bas karo maaiyavon... Rajnath Singh, and other such idiots in the BJP, should just shut the fuck up. Winning elections doesn't give them a right to spew their ignorance on all and sundry matters. Lol. Chutya saala I doubt if he can even speak 1 word of Sanskrit  I wish I could conduct sanskrit exam all these fellas ! The single most important trait for science and technology is free flow of information. ""I see further because I stand on the shoulder of giants"".

Sanskrit will hugely disrupt this (there are hundreds of thousands of journals and preprint servers); the world is not beating down our doors to learn sanskrit to publish their theses.

Moving S&T to Sanskrit would therefore be a massively retrograde step for India.   Someone should ask this idiot: since Sanskrit is so useful to Science, Mr Singh, can you develop the necessary science to provide some scientific validation of this claim? [deleted] OMG, what a chutiya ?  I charge my mobile using ""Sanskrit'. Wish he had usefully made his speech in Sanskrit; with all reporting in Sanskrit. Then we could ignore him more. [deleted] Scientific Method most useful for science, technology, actual scientists say. 

Yes, I know he was a physics lecturer. That makes this statement all the more unfortunate. 

Sanskrit / Panani's grammar were pioneering and inspired the likes of Chomsky to advance linguistics (later used for designing programming languages) - but it's not the most important component of science.   Sanskrit is a great language, but instead of making pointless statements like this, or attending meetings advocating cow protection, Rajnath could actually try and focus on his job. As someone who initially had great hopes on this government, I am confused as to where the priorities of this government currently lie. Says the guy who has credibility on this subject ..which is an Urban Legend/hoax. This guy is the Minister for Home Affairs.. Mutherfucker write a compiler in Sanskrit. I dare you. I double dare you. How the fuck did he get a Masters in Physics without understanding what science is? wut. As long as you can get your ideas across unambiguously, what does it matter what language you use? ITT, redditors who probably cannot even speak their mother tongue properly, decide to shit on ancient language - because they cannot use that language to lay bitches. 

 Advocating the promotion of Sanskrit, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday said even foreign scholars have considered it to be one of the most scientific of languages.

Respect! Sanskrit is an exceptional language as it is an artificially created language (Sam + Krita which means Completely Done or Completely Made)....While Sanskrit is undoubtedly better than most of the existing languages in many linguistic aspects it might not be that suitable for S & T, a single word in Sanskrit can have multiple meanings depending on the context of the sentence, thus making it ambiguous & unsuitable for S & T... This ambiguous nature is also one of the reasons why many S&T things remained hidden in disguise of shlokas & mantras. No it isnt'!!!

NEW DELHI: Lending a testimony to Indians' romance with mobile internet
consumption,

Niti Aayog

CEO (chief executive officer)

Amitabh Kant

, on Wednesday, tweeted that India has become ""world's no 1

mobile data

consuming country."" The tweet further said that,""It's(India) mobile data
consumption is higher than USA &amp; China's mobile data consumption put
together.""

> Amazing! With 150 cr gigabytes per month of mobile data consumption India is
now world's no 1 mobile data consuming... https://t.co/PnE4ihLdxo

> — Amitabh Kant (@amitabhk87) 1513908042000

Kant however, did not quote any source for the information.

In the recent past, India has witnessed a surge in mobile data consumption,
mainly with the introduction of

Reliance Jio

, which further led to competition in data plans among telecom companies.
Earlier this year, Reliance Industries chairman

Mukesh Ambani

had also claimed India's numero uno position in mobile data usage adding,"" Jio
users consumed more than 100 crore GB of data per month on the Jio network and
that's more than 3.3 crore GB a day.""

Earlier this week, a report released by investment firm Omidyar network
provided an insight to Indians' nature of mobile data use. The report claimed
that an average mobile internet user in India spends almost 70 per cent of the
time on apps like Facebook and WhatsApp, and music and entertainment apps.
This is much more than by people in the US, who visit these apps for only 50
per cent of the time they spend on the mobile phone. It further said that on
an average, a user in India spends 200 minutes a day on mobile apps, lower
than the US average of 300 minutes a day.

404,Science/Technology,What are the options for part-time undergraduate courses in science/technology for a bright student going through hard times,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/918ek7/what_are_the_options_for_parttime_undergraduate/,"I'm not sure how much detail is too much detail, but here's the story:

A few years ago, I was volunteering at a Government school teaching Mathematics and I had a student who is very good at maths and a step above the rest of his peers. He was keen on studying and quick at math. He is hands down one of the best students I had the opportunity to teach. 2 years ago, I was glad to learn that he got into IIIT for it's 6 year integrated program on a scholarship. He comes from a very poor family whose daily wage is few hundred rupees a day on the days they go to work, and he is the only one in his family pursuing studies beyond class X. His hostel campus is about 200 kms away from his home and he finished his +2. 4 more years to go.

However, as fate had it, just last week, his elder brother passed away. Obviously, his entire family is shook and is still recovering. During the rites, not sure if it was his mother or the ""elders"", the paranoia kicked in and it is his mother's and the majority of the ""edlers"" wish now, that he drop his education and support his elderly mother by starting to work as unskilled labor. He is however ""allowed"" to pursue any open degree or a degree at a local college while continuing to work, which I still count as a silver lining. The family is also in debt, so, according to their thinking, they cannot afford their only remaining son pursuing a degree for 4 years at this time.

Absolutely preposterous move, but this isn't unprecendented from families with very low income and very little or no education. Since they are in hard times, I will refrain from the bashing.

As I see it, there are two options. First, is to persuade the mother to let him continue his studies in IIIT so his future is better. A few of their educated kin have advised this to the mother, but I was told the advice fell on deaf ears, understandably so. His classes are starting this week and given his brother passed away only a few days ago, the timing is really bad. Plus, leaving the mother alone at this time also sounds horrible. 

The second option, is to give in to his mother's wishes, stay at home, go to work and pursue study part time. I talked to my student on phone. He is confused and torn, because like I said, he is keen on studying, but also wants to be there for his mother during the hard times. His mother and most of the ""family"" insisting that he go to work isn't really helping. Given that this is almost the end of July, most of the colleges have finished their admissions and he is worried about wasting an year. 

In IIIT, he chose Electronics as his major and he is very keen on pursuing a career in technology. I can vouch for him that he is ambitious and puts in the required work. It would be a shame if his talent/potential goes to waste due to the harrowing situation he found himself in.   I will try my best that he pursues the first option, however, reality is reality and he needs to be prepared for the worst. Given that he will work 48 hours a week and will have the rest of the time to pursue a degree, what are his options in terms of universities/colleges that are still open for admission and will let him pursue a degree part time(the closer to science/tech, the better)? Are there such programs for under-graduation? What are his other options?

Additonal details: His mother stays in Hyderabad, so, universities and colleges nearby are preferred. His mother works as a cobbler and moving to another place is not an option(IIIT Basara is at a remote place and he has to stay in the hostel if he has to pursue the degree). His current college will give a +2 certificate for admissions in a different college. He is turning 18 in a few weeks, but abandoning his mother at this time is not looking likely, unless she comes around after we persuade and is prepared for the hardship. Neither options are easy :(

Please keep the comments constructive. I wrote this in a hurry, so, my apologies if I sound crass.

**TL;DR: Which Universities/Colleges in/near Hyderabad provide option for part time study for a degree related to tech/science?** "," why not start a gofundme campaign for the debt ?. Then may be his mother can manage for few months and meanwhile the student can pick up a part time job? I feel the best option here is:

- The student should move out of hostel and rent a house near his college.
- The mother should move in with her son here.
- Funds should be raised to support the expenses of both.
- As they are from an impoverished family, I am sure they know how to make do with whatever amount they have. 
- If the mother wants to work, I am sure the college too could be convinced to hire her as a temporary worker.

The mother just wants to feel secure and be with her son. This is the best way to go about it without disrupting his study. 

If you are not able to convince them, involve the educated community elders of the students family to speak with his family to let the boy pursue his education. As finance is the major concern, show them proof of how much their son can earn once he graduates. Find out their political preference, and involve the local leader (preferably elected official) of whatever party they like to talk with the family to further pressurise them. You need to find who has the most influence on the family and try to understand their concern and offer uitable solutions to convince them. 

And thank you for having such concerns for your student - our country is the better for it due to people like you. "

408,Science/Technology,"OnlineRTI on Twitter: ""RTI CIC appointment - Modi Government invites anyone with wide experience in law, science, technology etc.""",https://twitter.com/OnlineRTI/status/525916977898860544,," The Central Information Commission, the Court for hearing RTI cases, has been left without a Chief Information Commissioner (CIC) for almost a month.

Modi government has invited anyone with experience in  in law, science and technology, social service, management, journalism, mass-media or administration and governance. 

This is the first time appointment of CIC is not based on seniority and based on merits.


DOPT  Circular - http://ccis.nic.in/WriteReadData/CircularPortal/D2/D02rti/4_7_2014_CIC-IR.pdf This is a good start. The current government has moved away from a seniority based appointment (earlier the senior most Information Commissioner was appointed the Chief) to an based appointment on application merit. Both processes have their own pros and cons.

However, there also seems be a road block. The [appointment process for a CIC](http://cic.gov.in/information_commissions.htm#19.) is done by a committee that includes the Prime Minister, one Union Cabinet Minister nominated by PM and the Leader of Opposition. We do not have a LoP as yet and any attempt to appoint one without the LoP may be viewed as a subversion of the process and therefore, unconstitutional. OR may be politically, we will soon see a LoP appointed. [**@OnlineRTI**](https://twitter.com/OnlineRTI):

409,Science/Technology,How satisfied are you with your child's exposure to science and technology? [Survey],https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/27alsc/how_satisfied_are_you_with_your_childs_exposure/,"I am interested in what /r/india parents (and even others) think about the quality of their child's exposure to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics).  Please help me by answering a short survey here: [http://www.instant.ly/s/QsV3U](http://www.instant.ly/s/QsV3U).

I'll post the results of this survey here on /r/India in a few days.

Disclosure: I am with an NGO committed to improving the quality of STEM exposure in India.  We will use your responses to guide our future activities.  You can learn more about us through our first activity --- a science fair in Bangalore --- here [http://www.escapevelocityfair.com/](http://www.escapevelocityfair.com/)"," From what I hear in India, there is literally zero exposure to scientific thinking; the more options are made to rote learning and puking back content in exams, than understanding. 

Problem? funding. Most of the schools / colleges have to keep cost low and apparatus as old as 1947 are there. 

Alternative: Make math and science fun. No, computers/ laptops/phones do not count in learning - they serve as more of games or entertainment than the real thing.  Not a parent, but we need more exposure to critical and rational thinking. The amount of people that immediately believe bogus chain mails and forwards is staggering. Just think people. Frankly, I don't see too many Indian parents particularly interested in their kid's education until they reach college.  Particularly parents who are in business and wealthy.

school jata hain.  fail nahin hota hai.  haan theek hain.  baad main kyaa hogaa dekhaa jayegaa.  abhi aur kaam hain.  business hi to karega.  padhne main zyada kuch nahin hain. I wish Indian media paid more attention to quality of education in India.  To begin with, shouldn't we have rankings of high schools and colleges in India.  India Today does some work on this, but given our population and the number of schools and colleges don't we need better quality, and comprehensive rankings. >here http://www.escapevelocityfair.com/

I support you..very nice initiative.

but..isko escape velocity nahi bolna tha..you know there's special joke of this on r/India. Don't Indian kids already have an overdose of science and academics?  You should be working to expose them to more sports and arts and literature. Your website is really ordinary.  

How much does it cost to get a really high quality website made?  50k? 

Surely you can afford that much money."

He has also offered alternative conceptions relating to cosmopolitanism and critical traditionalism. In addition to the above, Nandy has offered an original historical profile of India's commercial cinema as well as critiques of state and violence.

>""During the dispute over Babri Masjid, Ashis Nandy, a prominent Indian intellectual, began a series of interviews with R.S.S. members. A trained psychologist, he wanted to study the mentality of the rising Hindu nationalists. One of those he met was Narendra Modi, who was then a little-known B.J.P. functionary. Nandy interviewed Modi for several hours, and came away shaken. His subject, Nandy told me, exhibited all the traits of an authoritarian personality: puritanical rigidity, a constricted emotional life, fear of his own passions, and an enormous ego that protected a gnawing insecurity. During the interview, Modi elaborated a fantastical theory of how India was the target of a global conspiracy, in which every Muslim in the country was likely complicit. “Modi was a fascist in every sense,” Nandy said. “I don’t mean this as a term of abuse. It’s a diagnostic category.”

Recently i believe there was news of a company trying to patent pattals or leaf bowls and plates there which we use for prashad and bhandara.

412,Science/Technology,A criticism of the New Education Policy 2019 and existent education policies,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bwmz0o/a_criticism_of_the_new_education_policy_2019_and/,"**Problems with respect to HECI and fee fixation :**  One of the biggest problems that the policy has done, is that it has legitimized the policy of state exit and buttressed the belief of Private Education providing Quality education. **HEFA, as has been founded by GoI in association with Canara Bank and has  a corpus of 1 lakh crore of which centre is paying only 8500 crores, puts this whole thing into perspective. The rest of the corpus is to be attained via loans, which has to be repaid by institutes over period of time. Now, indirectly asking, on whom will the institutes push over this liability of 90,000 crores? Its the students, and the pricing of courses**. While Fee fixation and allowing autonomy is welcome to an extent, but let us not fool ourselves, any HEI with half decent infra would need a fuckton of expenditure and the money has to be absorbed from the peoples pockets

&#x200B;

**A blueprint towards privatisation of Higher education.** Not a word has been spoken about Quality Assurance or the fact of Accountability fixation towards Private institutes. ASSOCHAM reports that 93% of the MBAs in our country is unemployable. ( [https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/mba-education-problems-328626-2016-07-11](https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/mba-education-problems-328626-2016-07-11) ) Now lets get into this quandary. We want to privatise education without a semblance of accountability towards them really providing people quality skill upgradation. Let us look into the average unemployability, the Private college Engineer stands much worse in employability situation than the average NIT/JU/BESU (and am not even taking the better NITs and IITs and IIScs into picture). **THE WHOLE DOCUMENT PROMISES US LAVISH WORDS, MUCH PROMOTION, BUT IT SPEAKS ZILCH ABOUT WHERE THE FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE RAISED FROM. In the previous year we had seen how the INSTITUTE OF EMINENCE tag was given to JIO institute. This meant that they could raise a massive 1000 crores for over 10 years , but we all know the project never even begun, how can we judge its credibility and potential. The government did away 1000 crore clause for private institutes temporarily, but there has not been any subsequent clarification on it, thus proving  the** ***crony- corporate- neta - babudom clout*** **is taking over the education system too.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**The Report clearly shows that round about 49% of the children who take up education in Class 1 do not continue it beyond Class 10.**  The policy sort of considers that  this ratio will be maintained, and we should actually place infrastructure in such a fashion that it caters and provides quality care for the 51%. Implicitly it has recognized that the rest of the 49% will not come up, and that there would be more stress towards the 51% who continue than bringing up the 49% who are exiting the net.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Fails to address the biggest issue : EMPLOYABILITY .** Take this in two parts\*\*.\*\*

&#x200B;

**Employability of the lesser skilled :** THE Present Government **SINCE 2015** has been pushing the skilling agenda. Furthermore as has been the priorities of the policy, skilling has been mandated as an important part of the DEP,2019.   It had promoted the PPP model for skilling. But the model as Sharda Prasad report has shown has failed to muster much influence. So much so that 99.5% of the skilling units are government owned. The skilling institutes are marred with **CONFLICT OF INTEREST,** Malgovernance and the credibility of their skilling quality is pretty poor, once we look into the rates of employability after completing the courses. The NSQF framework has adopted a technique of **recognition to prior learning** \- but although the skill of a layman is getting recognized, what is its effective use, if it doesnt lead to any jobs? In the above tone lets also take up the **ISSUE OF SYLLABI in VT and diploma courses. The course structure in VT is haphazard enough with its whole bouquet of courses, preventing streamlining. This means aligning the courses to international requirements, ensuring a basic foundation in the 3Rs, and life-long learning**. It implies national standards for an in-demand skill set with national/global mobility that translates into better jobs. Short duration courses (with no real skills) that provide low pay for suboptimal jobs cannot be called national standards. Hence the current national standards have to drastically improve.   Germany has only 340 courses — in accordance with the National Classification of Occupations 2015 (which itself was based on the International Standard Classification of Occupations). Such trainees will be a national asset. **What we have instead are nearly 10,000 standards, produced mostly by consultants.** There cannot be thousands of standards (compressed into 2,000 qualification packs/job roles), and “delivered” to trainees in a matter of a few months. **This is not what the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) had recommended. The focus should be in strengthening reading, writing and arithmetic skills.** No skill development can succeed if most of the workforce lacks the foundation to pick up skills in a fast-changing world. Vocational training must by definition be for a minimum of a year, which includes internship (without which certification is not possible). **Short-term training should be confined to recognising prior learning of informally trained workers who are already working.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Employability of the higher skilled :** The problem of the higher skilled is sufficiently different from that of the lower skilled. Such a situation has happened due to few reasons :

1. promoting a flawed pattern of **EDUCATION FOR JOBS and MARKS**
2. Lack of requisite jobs in the sectors of choice. **Yojana in 2017 had carried out an Important little study where it matched the aspirations of students of HEI to the jobs that were prevalant across the state.** The results were near abysmal, given only few states had above 40% correlation between the jobs they were producing and the jobs that the students were demanding.
3. **Putting in a process of ""Hands On"" education and not  ""Hands free"" education.** While the government has been pushing its cause of making innovation an important part for Ranking HEIs and ranking technical institutes,and brought in a plethora of schemes to Encourage partnerships with such colleges that have a ranking of less than 200 as per QS,  the problems involving the lack of **""Hands On""** education are far more complicated than just that. It involves the problem of RoI on such innovation (credits system), the push towards Quantitative numbers (yes, more the number of papers, and not more the number of papers in journals having high impact factor), the lack of imaginativeness in our educational regime across society, all contributes to the same.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Romanticizing of Sanskrit and the past. Case in point, Bharatiya Shiksha Board.** No, we arent going to become a vishwaguru by promoting cow pee as a cancer cure. No, Bharatiya and vedic shiksha boards can never be equal to CISCE and CBSE. The skill imparted for doing astrology can only get a person to some VHP shakha, sorry it is never going to a man a job to earn a living. Promoting pseudo science in the name of TRADITION is blasphemy.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Mission Nalanda and Mission Taxila has said that there will be Higher Univ in every district,**  but there is no plan in place. The government trying to establish the fact that pushing private people to open and run univs can be good, but that will never be inclusive. **To remember all those who believe this is some new innovative plan of mudiji, the RUSA scheme and its intentions of opening HEIs across all EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD districts was present since UPA days. The present re-wrapping and calling for the Private sector gives me only a feeling of Skill India 2.0**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**ASER AND NAS reports clearly show the abysmal state of education in our primary levels. There has not been one attempt made to fix the situation,** rather than a vague policy prescription of INTERACTIVE EDUCATION. **Mid day meal and good nutrition might attract and increase the GER at entry level,** but it isnt going to solve the **LEARNING POVERTY GAP ISSUES .** Let us not fool ourselves, a country where the average class 5 to class 8 going child struggles to solve class 2 mathematics, skilling is an useless exercise. OECDs PISA report had ranked us abysmally, so much so that we withdrew participation from PISA and joined it back only this year. Economic Survey 2017 part 1 shows that the learning gap is far greater in girls wrt mathematics. In such a case solutions can be manifold. **Should we create a separate situation for girls, where they feel confident enough to take part in maths and science related activities? Studies have shown that given the Backward Upbringing that a female child often gets, combined with the fact that there is a huge Number of UNWANTED FEMALES ( Computed by metric Sex ratio of Last child) it is only expected that they would feel Underconfident than their fellow male compatriot who has better ACCESS to CARE, NUTRITION at home. The worst part of the report has been, although it has agreed time and over again about the learning poverty gap, it has ONLY PROMOTED SOME COSMETIC MEASURES LIKE FLIPPED LEARNING AND DIGITAL BOARDS.**

&#x200B;

**BRINGING UNIVS UNDER CIVIL SERVICE CONDUCT RULES.** One of the most important places of societal evolution and innovation and invention is the University. The varsity must be kept a free place, where infusion of ideas, permeability and penetration of ideas must be maximum. On the other hand, our government has left no stone unturned to bring the Univs under the ambit of CCS rules. Vide CCS rules ; A professor would not be able to openly criticize and elaborately express his dissent against a government policy in an editorial without having its approval. The problem is not just in bringing Univs under CCS, but a concealed attempt at making SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY and PROGRESS subservient to some whimsical stuff written in Ancient Textbooks. The Indian Science Congress was just a blatant attempt to push its agenda. Such vile attempts are being concealed under norms of **""PROMOTING RESEARCH IN CHOICE SECTORS"" , "" GRANTS FORWARDED TO SUCH RESEARCH THAT IS SOCIALLY VIABLE**""  and such other ambiguous terminology. (Vide schemes like IMPRESS, IMPRINT etc)

&#x200B;

**BRAIN DRAIN AND BRAIN USE .**  A wonderful opportunity lay right infront of our hands to reverse back atleast a section of brain that has been drained. Given the rise of RIGHT in USA and across many European nations, we could actually reverse and bring some of our talented brains back to our country. But for that we need a liberated education system, and a system that is ready to suitably employ such people with due remuneration. Also lets move into the issue of **BRAIN USE.** A very important issue here can be one of **social learning based methods, via ""Interested people"". Can we tap such brains, that are probably voluntarily unemployed, or maybe want a more respectable employment, and try to push them in sectors where they can impart learning to say a TRIBAL school, or maybe the average SSA school, with a honorary compensation**? We have always been crying ""HEY NO TEACHERS AND NO RESOURCE"" while we actually have resources that we arent ready to look into.

**ARE WE TRYING TO BE A GLOBAL LABOUR ECONOMY OR A GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY? The whole policy has been mired with ambiguities, where it speaks of IMPROVED ACCESS, but no QUALITY IMPROVEMENT, where it speaks of ACCESS IMPROVEMENT, but doesnt really proceed to describe how it would finance, and in places where it speaks of FINANCING of HEIs it seems to forgot the margins of difference that exist between a PSU and a Govt funded HEI. Private, for profit  education has never been linked to improved access in areas of low access. What seems further is the deceit by the govt to concede an explicit percentage of society as going to be ""leftovers, since they wont continue education anyways"" , and the deceit by the govt to EXIT in a sustained manner from a section that needed greater govt involvement in the veener of ""PRIVATE EMPOWERMENT"". The push for higher fees with minimal ""restraint"" will only lead to severe EXCLUSION of the lower rungs of the MIDDLE CLASS from the advantages of HEI while buttressing the hold of the upper echelons of the 1% both ""Sociologically and systematically"".**

A total hypocrisy where we speak of inclusive education yet, we believe FOR PROFIT education will push education to the EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD PLACES. The Vacancies in the biggest and best Institutes wrt FACULTY are being kept vacant intentionally, to show them in poor light, to the public, enabling generous privatization. Rather than being lost in dreams of how digital blackboards and play based education and a 5+3+3+4 education , which are cosmetic reforms to the real problems of POVERTY (in learning) , UNEMPLOYMENT and DEPLORABLE INFRASTRUCTURE.

413,Science/Technology,What is the Future of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in INDIA?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cj7xx0/what_is_the_future_of_artificial_intelligence_and/," 

A news report published in October in The Economic Times said, “Start-ups witness 108% growth in funding in India in 2018.” The news report further mentioned that Artificial Intelligence was among those domains which witnessed the fastest adoption among industry sectors. **Currently, there are about 400 start-ups working on AI and machine learning domains. About $150 million dollars is invested in India’s AI sector by private players alone and the number has been growing since 2016**. Though there has been growth, India lags far behind countries like the US and China in terms of investment. With a copious pool of STEM talent and with a growing population of youngsters, India will be banking on AI for its economic growth and improvement in the quality of life of its citizens.

There are several start-ups that are based in cities such as Bengaluru, New Delhi, Mumbai and Hyderabad which work on artificial intelligence principles to serve consumers better. Their product range varies from multi-lingual chatbots to online shopping assistance and automated consumer data analysis

&#x200B;

* **THE ROAD AHEAD**

The National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence which was put together by the government of India through NITI Aayog sets the roadmap on how to develop AI in the country. The report points out how AI will help the country grow, what are the strengths and what are the challenges on the way. The government has identified a few areas where it thinks AI will play a crucial role as far as India is concerned

 

Capital and qualified manpower are the two main pillars that are required for the establishment and growth of any sector. India is home to a large talent pool of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math graduates. Companies such as Google, Intel and Microsoft have been offering short term training programs to computer program developers which help them upskill in the area of AI programming. On the other hand AICTE, the government body which governs and regulates professional education in India, recently added AI, IoT, Machine Learning and few other subjects as mandatory subjects in its curriculum of B.Tech programs. Changes in curriculum and content are further expected in the days to come.

Investment towards AI from private players has been increasing in India ($44 million in 2016 to $77 million in 2017). The start-ups have been working towards developing various AI-based products and services. With conglomerates having a lion’s share in India’s market, there is huge scope for AI-based enterprise solutions in the country. The increasing demand for products and services can attract more investment towards R&D in AI sector

Let me give you an example. I worked at motorcycle manufacturer in an Assistant Manager role in R&D. My job was to measure the dimensions of electrical components for new motorcycle models. And for that, I was paid more than 6 lakhs per year.

We need it — we demand it; and this being the season of ballot boxes & EVMs, we yearn to vote to that end. 'Tis here, I beg to differ and ask: is it really a considerable choice when we're given to choose our predators, between lions, tigers and wolves? Yes, one of them is way worse than the others & needs to be gone for everyone's good; but is empowering the other murderers any better?

For as long as I remember, our lives have been spent as slaves & serfs to these powers: the fools, bigots & goons, called politicians we elect into leaders, the banks, capitalists & industrialists we sell ourselves to and to each other, caught in their barbaric game of tag, in which we're all 'it' in the end. I want to change all of that; don't you?

They say, everything big, starts small. Hence, in a world of 7.6 billion, would it be too wrong to start with our city of 14 million, prided so much for its openness, liberalism & intellegentia? Kolkata is OUR CITY: OUR COMMONS, OUR HOME, enclosed by bigots & greedy gluttons to have created a graveyard for our dreams and for life, especially for the thousands who pour into it everyday, hoping to obtain the collectively acknowledged fictional oxygen, called money, required of us all to exist. This is no longer a city, but a corporate heath, bearing concrete in place of vegetation.

I yearn of you, hence, let's not set aside our differences on who we wish to elect, which fiction we wish to pray to and so on, but evolve our minds to move beyond such gibberish and actually work to make this city sustainable, homely, liveable, post partisanism, post market, post capitalist and really smart, not just a dumb city with proprietary wifi, that the oligarchs deem smart. Let us build, on this pyre of yesterdays' failures, a new city that truly would shower joy on all.

Considering today's problems, my wish is to take back the city into our collective hands, as our commons, manage it so, and make it thrive, not grow exponentially. Of course, when I say take back, I don't ask for a violent revolution of the ploretariat, but establishment of mutual-aid-networks & P2P Commoning practices, with each of our houses, condos, etc. being its reliable nodes. It is impossible to build such a space using current structures, such as the market (a network where people paywall goods & services to exploit each other & accumulate capital) or the state, with its systemic biases of race, religion, etc., the NGO circus standing on Corporate Social Responsibility Grants, acting as band-aids distributed by those that machine gun us, and other top-down, vertical (hierarchical) institutions. Therefore let's start here, as the Kolkata Commons Collective, a mutual-aid-network, where we organize ourselves horizontally, as equals, and work hard to produce, maintain and common the commons for us all to enjoy.

In case you think my beliefs to be Utopian and my ideas too lofty, the same was & still is thought of the knowledge commons: Wikipedia, the numerous thriving Wikis, Free & Open Source Software, especially Linux, which powers apart from the desktops of a few of us, the entire internet, all supercomputers, most phones (Android, Sailfish, Tizen), Open Source Hardware such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, RISC V, the Wikispeed car, FOSMC bike, 3D Printers, Open Designs, Creative Commons works, Theatre Commons grouups, Cities like Seoul, Barcelona, Brussels, etc., the hackerspaces & real makerspaces (anarchist, non-profit, commons oriented ones, unlike the corporate, for-profit open washes of science museums & technical schools) coming up around the world, etc., and many more. The big question is, whether we continue our banal, servile, practically cannibalistic ways, being skeptical of our capabilities, or pitch in to prove the market-worshiping, orthodox, skeptics wrong, to liberate ourselves and eveyone else?

[Here's a nice introduction to the Commons](https://youtu.be/nsRFdBBOyzU?t=155).

After that of course, let us please network & work! Here are some of my proposals — a list to which you're more than welcome to add, via comments maybe.

Proposals:—

* Localizing our physical, economic circuits to reduce the ecological footprint & make the city resilient to calamities, both natural & artificial. The media may be glorifying Orissa on its disaster management, since Fani hit, but let's remember that huge sectors of the state are still dead, without electricity, water, etc. since being dependent on a centralized power grid system, they've no recourse but wait for the long electrical and other circuits to be connected again become functional again.
* So noting the above, creating, improving & sharing our own version of [Open Source Ecology](http://opensourceecology.org/)'s [Global Village Construction Set](https://www.opensourceecology.org/gvcs/gvcs-machine-index/), and establishing a network of [Hackerspaces](https://hackerspaces.org/) to start manufacturing [Glocally](http://commonstransition.org/what-is-p2p-an-introduction/) (doing the light things globally and the heavy things locally), to aid us.
* Running a web of [SOLEs (Self Organized Learning Environments)](https://www.theschoolinthecloud.org/) to aid our education.
* Creating a distributed internet based on meshnet technology, using the [ESP8266](http://esp8266.net/) and similar Open Source Wireless microchips, protocols like [LoRaWAN](https://lora-alliance.org/about-lorawan) like systems, etc., to free our dependence on centralized, paid, private connection providers  we use to access the WWW and communicate. So think distributed web with [IPFS](http://ipfs.io/) & [dat](https://datproject.org/) protocols, along with garlic routed, P2P VoIP, accessible & managed as a common, without any central authority or monetary barriers.
* Manufacturing & distribution of basic phones similar to the [WiPhone](http://a.wiphone.io/), to inhabitants who require it, and much, much later, a fully Open Source, [RISC V](https://riscv.org/) based smartphone running [Android ROM](https://source.android.com/)s or [GNU/Linux distros](https://itsfoss.com/open-source-alternatives-android/) with touch friendly UIs.
* Establishing a real, public transport system using car-sharing algorithms (Real Sharing and not Uber/Ola/Lyft/.../'s share washed micro-lending economy) to share the leftover seating & storage spaces on our existing Cars, converting our petrol & diesel drinkers to sustainable, local sources, such as electric, via renewables like solar, wind, hydro, etc., collecting, scavenging & hacking the abandonned vehicles, lying on randomly on roads, especially around Police Stations to aid these ventures, producing, distributing & evolving the [WikiSpeed](http://wikispeed.org/), [OSCAR](http://www.theoscarproject.org/), [OpenMotors](https://www.openmotors.co/)' [Tabby](https://www.openmotors.co/tabbyevo/), [FOSMC](https://www.fictiv.com/blog/fosmc), & other platforms, and connecting them as a Transport Commons for everyone to enjoy.
* Running networks of [submersiles](https://www.openrov.com/), [solar powered](https://solarimpulse.com/), [lightweight](http://ligeti-stratos.com/index.html) [aircraft](http://makerplane.org/) & [low altitude satellite systems](https://libre.space/), to physically reach greater distances without having to go through state regulations and corporate pay walling.
* Establishing distributed power-grids, using solar, wind and other available, sustainable technology, to escape our dependence on the Power Corps.
* Movement to Open Source platforms, as opposed to proprietary, private ones to remove our dependence on Corps. For instance, moving from MS Windows, Apple Mac OS X, etc. to GNU/Linux distros, FreeBSD forks, etc.
* Nurturing Open Source Communities, to voluntarily labour to help develop the global Open Source pool and other Commons
* Creating a [network](https://farm.bot/) of Vertical Farms, Aeroponic Gardens, Aquaponic Greenhouses, and so on to [produce](http://farmhack.org/tools) Food Commons for us all, networking into a post-market, moneyless ecosystem using the [Open Food Network](https://openfoodnetwork.org/).
* Creating a network of sustainable [water](http://www.freewat.eu/) cycles to provide potable, [fresh water commons](http://openwaterfoundation.org/).
* Providing universal healthcare as a commons, producing [Open Source medicines](http://www.opensourcepharma.net/) & [medical equipment](https://hackaday.com/2018/01/30/making-the-case-for-open-source-medical-devices/), in our mesh of [bio-hackerspaces](https://biohack.me/), [while also](http://openbci.com/) [extending our human bodies](https://openprosthetics.org/)' capabilities through transhumanist practices and sustaining a thriving grinding (biohacking) culture in the city.
* Hacking our prodigal buildings to make them [more comfortable, effective & efficient](https://www.openbuildinginstitute.org/), connecting everything with DiY Open Source IoT systems.
* Nurturing a thriving pro-science, DiY, hacker/maker culture in our city along with aiding education in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts & Mathematics) and the humanities in their advanced forms ... the list goes on.
* And finally, scaling to the suburbs and villages of West Bengal, and even other cities in other states, connecting Kolkata to the global commons movement, and making ourselves visible on the global map, to help liberate the world.",
415,Science/Technology,Need help with depression and anger.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7yz12m/need_help_with_depression_and_anger/,"Recently got my heart broken, realised it was unrequited love. Been feeling like shit since then. Now I think I'll have to live with this all my life. My life is nearly fucked up beyond all repairs. I thought this might be the last phase of my depression but it's just another phase, all I want to know is when will this shit end. My demons are killing me from inside. I'm hurt more than I show.

The anxiety and insecurity was killing me from a long way back but now when came to know about it being unrequited just turned them into deep/severe depression. I just can't concentrate on any thing. My memory is all gone I think, I'm numb and soulless from inside. 

I was handling it pretty well then day before yesterday one of my toxic friend started snooping her and then messaged me about it which fucked me up pretty badly. I just don't know why, what am I doing. 

Nowadays for me a ""good day"" is the one in which I'm less hurt and less dying from inside. I don't think there's anything called ""happiness"" it's just a myth in my opinion. 

I even read 'The subtle art of not giving a fuck' it helped me for sometime but now I'm again back to square one. 

Why is that all of a sudden all I'm thinking about are relationships, all my friends discuss onlu about girls and then they start crying about their past failed relationships man don't you guys have anything else to discuss. We're just 18 why can't we discuss something about science, technology,career, business, politics etc why the fuck all of a sudden after entering the college all I hear and discuss about relationships, ""ohh what if I die single"" ""ohh why I'm a nice guy"" ""ohhhh Fuck I never had been in a relationship till now and I don't wanna graduate single"" are the thoughts which wander in my mind. 

Pre-college I was never like this, I was a positive guy, minding my own fucking business, wanted to do something in life, had so many dreams of my career but now 7-8 months later all those realistic goals are blurred all I'm surrounded by is ""relationship goals"" why is my generation so much into this ""my soul mate"" shit can't they focus on their career and become something big so that their parents can be proud of them? No all they want is a ""shoulder to cry on"" ""another person to share all they had in their good for nothing day"" more interested in ""opposite gender"" if you don't have any ""opposite gender bestie"" then you're a piece is shit, if you don't have a ""significant other"" you're good for nothing, if you're a shy guy who just likes to listen more than to speak then you're not worth ""dating"". 

And what's wrong with this Indian system of dating. You first start ""liking"" the other person then you ""propose"" and then you start dating. Dafaq!!?  Why can you first start ""seeing"" each other then start dating and then if things turn out pretty good then you're automatically in a relationship no need to propose for being ""girlfriend/boyfriend"".

I'm just losing it all, I don't want to be in a relationship I don't even wanna hear anything related with it, all I want is to concentrate on my career cause that's what will start with me in the long run. But apparently I can't focus on it. Anybody of you got anything which might help me? 

I've decided to change few things surrounding me and with myself.

1) I'll not speak or discuss anything about relationships or my heart break with friends in college anymore cause all they give is very toxic advice like beating up the other guy and so on.

2) I'll try my best to focus back on my career.

3) I'll try ""pleasure-mastery"" therapy.
....

Will add if you guys advice something worth it."," Go through these things maybe it can help you. 

1. Get off social media, right now. Social media has been linked the number 1 place where one can get depressed easily, by looking at where your friends are and their success and looking at where you are. Want a hang of social media, Do redditing. Here people don't know you. Go to the subreddits that interests you. Talk your heart out.   

2. Get a hobby. Something interesting like writing, trading in market, photography, which ever takes your interest try it.   

3. Stop caring about society and don't give a shit about it. Society will be first one to trash you when you do something wrong. Stop caring about what people feel abot you. Their thinking is dynamic and will change according to circumstances.   

4. Discover a new outlook towards life. 

5. You have to survive no matter what life gives you.   


**Think of yourselves as company whose shares prices have tanked down to their all time low. Take decisions that will take the company high. Don't lose hope.**

**You Go out there and Kill it**

All the Best :)  Man! This brings back memories.

In the immediate aftermath, I felt like being the worst human being. I mean, if being nice still gets you hurt, what's the point of being nice? But for some unknown reason, I didn't go down the dark path of self-sabotage.


The first month was hard. I felt numb. I tried the Body scan technique of mindfulness (Lecture 8, TTC Mindfulness...courtesy tpb :-)

It was nice.


But my recovery started with Brexit and a feeling of schadenfreude. In hindsight, I feel it was a negative straw to latch on to. But it rejuvenated my curiosity to learn about the world i am in.


After a while, I found my appreciation for simple joys of life like pani puri, walking, ice-cream. I am not saying your grief is not real. Heck, the condition I was in, any advice would have made my self-loathing worse.


Did you watch Black Panther? It's super cool.


Perhaps, [the book of life](https://www.youtube.com/user/schooloflifechannel/videos) will cheer you up.

EDIT:

Don't watch [\(500\) Days of Summer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfMaE0KFNpU)."
416,Science/Technology,"[NP]Engineering Education In India: Hot Intake, Cold Results",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4gbzmf/npengineering_education_in_india_hot_intake_cold/,"Under the new NDA government, there has been a rush to establish a glut of premier technical institutions. A proposal for six new IITs has been ratified, in addition to the nine new ones already established in 2008. The total number of candidates in the JEE (Mains) was 12.5 lakhs this year. The All India Council for Technical Education recognizes a whopping 6,378 institutions for undergraduate engineering study, with a humongous intake of 31.78 lakh. The All-India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) report for the year 2013-14 pegs the proportion of undergraduate enrolment in engineering, technology and computer fields combined at 20.08%, second only to the combined field of Arts, Humanities and the Social Sciences.

However, does quantity mean quality? Does offering long-reaching career choices to students not old enough to vote or drink, and parents out of sync with the current market and research scenario fare well in the context of Indian higher education?

**Indicators of Concern**

*Employability*

The National Employability Report published by Aspiring Minds in 2015 presents worrying numbers that paint a sorry picture. It found a meagre 17.91% engineers employable in the software services sector, and an abysmal 3.67% in the software products sector. In non-IT roles, the statistics were as alarming, with only 6.5% and 5.55% engineers employable in design roles in electrical and mechanical engineering respectively. 

The report comments that most candidates lack basic programming and algorithmic knowledge, and in non-IT core roles, there is lack of a clear grasp of fundamentals, which is often the only thing required by recruiters. In fact, it says that 60% of engineers lag behind by not possessing specific domain knowledge. 

The go-to option for a burgeoning class of aspirers, engineering represents the “easy path”, and a focus on end results eclipses learning processes. Moreover, choices of specialization are made based on entrance examination ranks, before any taste of specialised curricula or actual field work in a particular subject. Such ill-informed decision-making is bound to generate an outpouring of reluctant engineers who are confused and ill-equipped in their respective areas. 

*Output*

The other important outcome of technical education is research and development. Contributing to advancing technology in terms of academic research and patents is an important development indicator, as R&D output has direct effects on economic prosperity and standard of living. 

The SCImago Journal & Country Rank rates publications and countries in terms of research output in different fields. Ranking countries by citations-per-document published, which indicates the average number of times a paper has been cited by other works, we find India ranked a middling 40th among 87 nations with at least 1000 engineering publications from 1996 to 2014. 

According to data collected by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on selected indicators of innovation among labs and higher educational institutions in 2014, we find India comes 31st out of 48 ranked entities in terms of patents filed per GDP as a percentage (including a combined number for the EU, which comes above India). 

We see how India languishes in the middle in terms of both patents and it the citation counts of academic publications. What forces are afoot that drag India’s comparative performance into mediocrity despite the colossal undergraduate intake? Let’s crunch some numbers to get to the bottom of it.

**A Chain of Causes**

*Postgraduate Education*

Research output also measures the health of postgraduate and doctoral education in the countries, signalling the willingness of undergraduates to continue in the field of their choosing. A report published in 2013 by the South Asia Development Sector of the World Bank says that 94.56% of engineering students in India are undergraduates, with only 5.4% in Master’s programs, the lowest but for Brazil. 

At the same time, a 2014 report published by the Student Exchange and Visitor Program (SEVP) in the United States says that a huge majority (81%) of India-based graduate students are in STEM fields. 

This data points to a prevalent scenario in which limited information and social pressure compels undergraduates to pick engineering, but the higher education machinery fails to retain numbers at postgraduate levels, at least in India.  Students who can afford it fly abroad, especially to the US for search of better options in education and employment. 
The AISHE 2013-14 report also says that only 9% of its respondents who had enrolled in postgraduate courses went on to pursue a PhD in the field, which links us to the next issue. 

*Throttled Funds*

The dearth of doctoral students in engineering fields owes itself in no small part to inadequate compensation. Junior research fellows take home Rs. 25,000 per month, while senior PhD candidates get Rs. 28,000. Moreover, insufficient funds are allocated to science and engineering research, making the production of high quality matter more challenging. 
International Science and Engineering Indicators published by the National Science Foundation of the USA include the proportion of GDP expended on R&D, based on which India ranks 40th among 60 nations studied, with a lowly 0.81%
. 

*Teacher Numbers*

Above, we saw how small a percentage of students transition to postgraduate and doctoral studies in their fields, and by extension, the number of qualified teachers at college level falls down, denting the prospects of a proper education for subsequent generations of students, creating a vicious loop of negative feedback. 

Two other statistics and their comparisons in the above mentioned World Bank report signal a severe shortage of teaching resources in the engineering education arena.

Using general higher education statistics from MHRD reports in 2011, the report estimates the average faculty per institution at 19, and the student-to-faculty ratio at 24. The latter ratio depicts the even spreading of teaching resources, and a high value means lesser attention to every individual student’s learning objectives. To put the number into perspective, the AICTE recommends a ratio of 12 at undergraduate level, and 15 at graduate level. 

With better-paying avenues in regular jobs, most fresh graduates stay away from the lengthy and arduous path of academia and teaching.

**Conclusions**

The lack of postgraduates, doctoral researchers, and the best teachers prevents the blossoming of a rewarding academic atmosphere and thus makes departments accumulate reluctant and untrained teachers, by making them unattractive to the best talents.  This stunts exposure to good teaching and research for undergraduates, which in turn contributes to disillusionment, insufficient interest and technical knowledge, low employability rates, and a departure from technical fields of work and study post their first degree, feeding the crippling dearth of skills and results at higher levels.

"," So it's basically a fridge. >and in non-IT core roles, there is lack of a clear grasp of fundamentals, which is often the only thing required by recruiters. In fact, it says that 60% of engineers lag behind by not possessing specific domain knowledge. 

Anecdotal but i can attest to just a handful of my electrical engineering class of 61 actually understanding what we were being taught. The rest were just in in to clear the exams.

IMHO, another indicator of the quality of a country's education is the contents of the text books it's home-grown authors produce. The indians ones are by and large terrible. The focus on rote learning and mindless memorisation is soul-crushing. And those ""guides"" are so bad it's not even funny. 

This problem is compounded when the people teaching you use the same guides to teach and themselves don't understand what they're teaching. I got into several arguments about my scores being docked because i'd solved something by actually thinking instead of using what was in the ""book"".  Very well written!

IMO, the good faculties are on the look out for good PhD students and good PhD students are on the look out for good faculties. Currently, it is hard to find either in India. As OP mentions,

> The dearth of doctoral students in engineering fields owes itself in no small part to inadequate compensation.

From the Computer Science and Engineering perspective, there are two sides to this. In general, a student who has the capacity to do a good PhD is likely capable of working in a good corporate company. Say a good student gets a job which pays ~7lpa. If he/she stays in the industry for 5 years, this would definitely (atleast) double. One can lead a good decently luxurious life with this sort of income. Now come to the Indian PhD student. He/she earns 3.36lpa + travel + book grants, for 5 years (it is not common to have raises for a PhD student). What follows is obvious.

Now one could argue that a student who is actually interested in research should not bother about money. But hell, the student also has a life outside research and needs to have some savings for the future! It is not easy to find jobs in India which require PhDs and do justice to them.

Now without good students, it becomes difficult for good faculties to 'want' to stay in the country. This can, again, be fixed by increasing compensation and freedom for the faculties. 

We need to take lessons from Israel. A country as big as Mizoram, has 9 universities, around 6 of them being in the top 100 universities of the world. Even though I do not trust world rankings too much, it is sufficient enough to believe that their 6th will be as good as our best. How did they manage this? I am not sure, but I do not think nationalism has played too much of a role. It is probably due setting up the best infrastructure, inviting the best researchers, giving them sufficient compensation and a lot of academic freedom.

**tl; dr** Invite the best researchers, give them sufficient compensation, academic freedom. Students and quality of research will follow. Can we also use the argument in OP's post to explain how so little engineering is actually done in india and how many of the ""engineering"" firms are just glorified contractors? http://408perceptions.blogspot.com/2016/08/engineering-in-inida-is-waste-of-time.html whatch this article

People there at large feel the man is not at all qualified for the job and students are planning for a massive protest against the high-handed appointment. There was no prior consultation was faculty member there whatsoever.

Now I did some digging and found out there seems to be pattern amongst all of the recent appointments.

I understand when a new govt comes to power it appoints its own people to the govt offices. When UPA came to power in 2004, it replaced most of the state governers with its own sympathizers. Now that BJP has come to power, it did the same thing except Mr. Najib Jung. **Fair enough and pretty much consistent**

But one thing I don't get is why is BJP appointing unqualified people in the institutions of national importance? How does it serve any purpose? Isn't it against the very philosophy of Make In India? If you want India to develop, you need to have qualified guardians at the institutions of national importance.

I understand that India academia is highly influences by leftist ideology which I personally despise. I'm libertarian & pro-capitalism when it comes to economic ideology. 

BJP is Far Right Wing which has pro-capitalism as economic philosophy at its core. But how do recent appointments justify it? If right wing is about market capitalism, should not BJP give more autonomy to these institutions, instead of screwing up their reputation with high-handed appointments.

I understand top brass of BJP/RSS feel that curricula of Indian education system is against Indian culture/traditions. They also feel that history subject is biased. But if they want to change it, shouldn't they do it at the school level. 

Anyway institutions like IIT/TIFR/IISSc/IIMs are mostly about science, technology & technology. So, why messing with them?

India already doesn't have any Univ in the top 300 ranking of QS world ranking. With recent high-handed appointments, I'm sure their quality will take a nosedive.

This is pretty much my thoughts. Let us please discuss it. I would request people not to take sides. Please be objective in your analysis based on logic. It's not about BJP/Congress/AAP. It's about me and your future.

"," Off topic, but I should probably avoid trying for FTII next year? I dont know about FTII. As far as research institutes go, there is a bit of laxity and there is no direction in research. Most scientists just want to publish papers, and I am not  trying to undermine the importance of publishing papers or basic research, but there has to be a goal of developing technology/product which aligns with national policy and interests. 

ISRO is a good example when a research institute is in alignment with national interests and policy. This example is probably a little simplistic because in institutes like IIT/IISc/NCL etc it is harder to define goals. And even harder to achieve these goals.

To develop a technology which is applicable in the real world, it takes a lot of time and effort and in addition almost every new technology takes a multidisciplinary approach to develop. From my experience the Indian research institutes lack severely in the latter.

There are several other problems as well, but be assured appointment of a member of board of director or even director of an institute will not affect the quality (existing) of research in the institute. And the low world rankings are mostly because of lack of infrastructure and lop-sided faculty/student ratio.

 [deleted] > Anyway institutions like IIT/TIFR/IISSc/IIMs are mostly about science, technology & technology. So, why messing with them?  

Because they have failed at their primary goals? Negligible research output, unimpressive pedagogy and a vision that is missing in action. A bit of a shakeup at the top wont hurt. 

FTII on the other hand deserved better than Sri Gajendra. 
 >WHat the hell! Seems, downvoting brigade is already activated

Party before Country . Right-wingers definition of nationalism . kids have come to power after 60 years :) . Don't worry next elections they are gonna loose for sure and every state elections from now on  FTII, and Indian film making in general, is as shitty as it can get.

People say Gajendra Chouhan is not qualified to be FTII chief. I say FTII is so shitty, even a random 40 year old with some life experience can only improve it. The one condition is that he/she should not come from FTII, or Indian mainstream film-making, which is just pure horseshit. 
  how is FTII and institution of national importance?

Second question, why should government be in the business of running FTII. >But one thing I don't get is why is BJP appointing unqualified people in the institutions of national importance?

You have **one** data point for this.  OP, just one correction. BJP is not far right in the generally accepted spectrum. If anything they would be considered left of centre. Economically, not much separates the BJP and tbh most other parties. Between the Congress and BJP? It is just that the BJP has better execution of projects and lesser vote bank politics. Youth congress making a mountain out of a molehill. Just riling up students for no rhyme or reason. Did UPA not make appointments for these posts? Did EVERY government not make appointments? This is just a front.

424,Science/Technology,An Exposition and Solution to the NGO problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/28fy7b/an_exposition_and_solution_to_the_ngo_problem/,"**Disclaimer**: I am not the author. This excellent essay was written by Rudradev@BRF.  

NGOs are non-profit organizations whose ostensible role is to fill in the gaps of social service: education, community services (such as sanitation and health), conservation of natural resources etc. that a government is either too resource-poor and overburdened to fill (as in India) or is not mandated to fill for reasons of small-government conservative political philosophy (as in many developed Western countries).

There have been many such organizations that would fit today's definition of the NGO, that have in fact done a lot of good in India. Amul was a farmer's cooperative in Gujarat that transformed the dairy industry. Baba Amte's organization helped leprosy patients who suffered unjust marginalization and ostracism in rural Maharashtra. The Chipko movement was spearheaded by tribals to preserve their own forest resources. The IDRF and the RSS have been at the forefront of many disaster relief missions. As long as these movements are indigenous, draw their support from local volunteers, and function in coherence with deep-state interests, they have been able to contribute important and desirable services of all kinds.

The problem, of course, arises when foreign resources are used to support NGOs working in India. I have a couple of stories that illustrate why this is by no means a new problem in India, and to suggest a potential solution to the problem of ""filling the gaps in services"" that have given foreign-funded NGOs a way into our system.

The first case involves a close relative of mine. As a newly-minted engineer in the early 1950s, he came to Bombay to join a Government of India concern. The concern at the time was inducting a new technology with American help, as part of a USAID program. An American had been sent to train the Indian engineers in the use of this new technology as part of the foreign assistance package. This was a very common arrangement in the first decade after independence, when the GOI's mission statement emphasized advancements in science, technology and industry.

This American had spent some of his early years in Dehra Dun, and did a passable job of speaking Hindi. He was a genuine expert in his field, was employed full-time at a major US corporation, and trained the young Indian engineers very well. He would also sit in his office after hours, late into the night, typing messages into a telex machine. The Indian engineers, including my relative, would sometimes wonder what was up... ""jasoosi kar raha hai kya?"" On one occasion one of the Indians brought up the matter with the IAS officer in charge of the concern. His reply: ""Is he teaching you well? Then learn from him. Why are you worried what he is doing or not doing otherwise.""

And indeed, they were learning a lot from this American; as young men with Indian traditional values, they respected him as a guru, and in fact many of them went on to have successful and illustrious careers with the benefit of his knowledge. So they let it go.

It wasn't until 20 years later that my relative discovered, by chance, a newspaper clipping of his old American trainer receiving a medal from US President Gerald Ford. It turned out the American was an OSS man who had served with distinction in Burma during the Second World War, and had been on deputation with the CIA in many countries since then, including India.

The point of this story is that this sort of thing has been going on for a long time, ever since India became independent. Foreign assistance came to India at the GOI's request to help fill the gaps in governance (such as advanced training) that the GOI itself was not equipped to plug. Often the assistance package came with strings attached; they were manned by foreign intelligence agents, for example. More surprisingly the GOI KNEW about this, and accepted it... they probably monitored the foreign agents' activities, and tried to ensure that they didn't get their eyes on anything too sensitive, but in the interest of the ""greater good"", GOI policy determined that it was better to have a CIA guy training Indians in a new technology than to not have the training at all. That's just how the priorities shook out.

One can almost understand the appetite for these sort of ""arrangements"" in a new and desperately poor nation willing to pay a high price to improve its future prospects. However, as we know, India's prospects did not improve substantially over the following decades. Corrupt, self-serving regimes led by successive Dynasty potentates showed little interest in building self-sufficiency, in plugging the gaps in governance or indeed, in providing any governance at all. Thus, what was deemed a necessary evil in the 1950s did not fade into obsolescence by the 1960s or 1980s or 2000s... instead, it transformed into an extremely powerful and well-established institution in its own right. The industry of foreign funded NGOs came to dominate every aspect of social, judicial, economic and environmental activism across the length and breadth of India. Over the decades, it usurped mandates extending far beyond its originally stated purpose of supplementing government services. All the while, of course, it never held any commitment to upholding the interests of the Indian deep state.

The NGO monster reached the pinnacle of its strength under Sonia Gandhi's regime over the last decade, finding its ultimate embodiment in the National Advisory Council: a parallel national-level policy-making apparatus, indebted to all manner of foreign interests, that did not supplement the elected Government of India but utterly sidelined it. In the meantime, every constitutionally-mandated institution of the Indian deep state: financial, internal security, armed forces, judicial, was systematically undermined and eroded. This, in fact, is what the IB is warning us of the urgent need to roll back.

So now to my second story that suggests a possible solution to this problem. There are persistent lacunae in social and environmental services that the GOI does not yet fill in India; this we all know. It's also true that the GOI has a vast roster of priority issues to fix at a macro-level, so that however indefatigable Mr. Modi might be, he might very well never get around to taking on these lacunae himself. How do we ensure that they are filled by agents with a sterling sense of commitment to the Indian deep state?

The second story involves a gentleman named Mike who was my neighbour in NYC. I met him when he was 84, and he died five years later.

Mike was a first-generation Italian American immigrant who grew up supporting eight siblings in a small town in upstate New York during the Great Depression. This was a double-whammy: Italians were racially discriminated against by the WASP majority, and the economic circumstances of the time engendered a sort of starvation-level poverty, a near absence of hope in terms of access to education or employment, that the US has not known since the second world war ended.

The solution came from Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a US President whom Mike revered as almost greater than human. Apart from a sweeping series of macro-level fiscal reforms, Roosevelt introduced a volunteer initiative called the Civilian Conservation Corps. As part of the New Deal, the CCC provided unskilled manual labour jobs related to the conservation of natural resources in government-owned lands, creating employment for the deprived while also implementing a general natural resource conservation program in every state and territory.

Over 3 million young Americans participated in the CCC, which provided food, shelter and clothing as well as a small stipend; however, it did something far more important. It provided a population on the brink of despair with a sense of commitment, a motivation to serve the community and the nation, and a will to public responsibility. It restored the dignity of a generation who would otherwise have been reduced to begging on the streets. In the case of Mike, and many lakhs of Italian-Americans, this brought about an invaluable infusion of a nationalist spirit that brought them from the margins of society into the mainstream. Learning skills as he went along, conducting minor maintenance on public utilities, helping keep the streets and parks clean and sanitary, Mike eventually joined the US Navy and fought in the Pacific as a Diesel Mechanic on an LST. The GI bill, also a Roosevelt initiative, gave Mike the opportunity to get an automobile engineering degree afterwards, transforming his life (and that of his family) beyond recognition.

What could have been a wasted life of social marginalization and economic victimhood was transformed into an asset to the nation in every way. As one consequence, more Italian immigrants signed up to fight for the US in the Second World War than the total strength of Mussolini's forces!

A very similar initiative to the CCC was taken up by the NSDAP in Germany around the same time: the creation of the Arbeitsdienst. It is derided as ""fascist"" in the dominant Western narrative of today, but it contributed a great deal to the spirit of millions of young men who grew up in the crushing deprivation of Weimar Germany but found themselves willing to sacrifice everything for the Reich.

Can we begin to imagine a time when the ""marginalized"" sections of our own society aren't deliberately kept ""marginalized"" for the benefit of NGOs who profit from their ongoing despair? Where the service left undone by the GOI isn't left to foreign agents with no regard for our national interest, but indeed transforms a generation of Indians... through the very act of rendering that work... into the foremost proponents of national interest in the future?"," Remaining essay: 


This can ONLY happen when the volunteer agencies who fill in the gaps left by the GOI
(1) are initiated, mandated and funded by the deep-state itself;
(2) inculcate through their activities a sense of mission, dignity and responsibility that serves aspiration rather than victimhood;
(3) are TRULY not-for-profit, and are not designed to perpetuate their own existence indefinitely.

This last is a crucial distinction; NGOs which define themselves as ""non-profit"" have a strong interest in maintaining the deprivation of those they claim to ""help"", because their OWN survival, and the perpetual continuation of their gravy train, depends on it."

There is No God, there is no rebirth, there is no heaven or hell. But there is this universe, where we all exist.

 A little over 300,000 years ago we emerged as Modern Humans in Africa. We learnt to make tools, tamed fire, hunt in groups and mine for obsidian to make tools and eventually farming. We left Africa about 200,000 years ago, we started farming, domesticating animals  and started making clay potteries,  we started to harness the power of fire to make pots, utensils, and brick. Then we discovered copper, using the very technology we developed to make pots and brick. Bronze was the next step in this technological progress of controlling fire. Then 3,000 years ago iron was discovered, iron could only be extracted, when humans were able to raise the temperature of fire to above 1900 °C wherein iron started to melt from the ore. With this came the era of technological leap from stronger transport vehicle, ships and communications. Faster connection to the world via roads made using these steal and iron tools. We made great leaps in terms of medicine, physics, maths and chemistry. These technological progress not only made our life better but also extended our life expectancy for 30 years to 60 years on an average. And then about 300 years ago we entered the industrial revolution that gave us mass production, luxury items for everyone and communications ability to talk to people in real time across the globe. In less than a 100 years we went from a globe that relied on telephone and telegraph , steam ship and sailboat, to a globe that now has video calling, the ability to access the repository of all human knowledge literally in the palm of your hand. The modern world we live in is because of people working together to bring technology and social welfare to all. But this evil thing call religion is dead set on taking us humans back to the Stone age. 


Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion. As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed. Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. Fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.

Dear r/all please do take the time to know about the recent religious riots happening in the Capital city delhi /r/India"," I don't think ""atheist"" or ""none"" is an option under the official column of religions in India. So if you are born in a Muslim family you'll forever be a Muslim, unless you convert to some other religion. There are officially no ""atheists"" in India. We need to change this and develop the atheist culture in India. Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able?
Then He is not omnipotent.

Is He able, but not willing?
Then He is malevolent.

Is He both able and willing?
Then whence cometh evil?

Is He neither able nor willing?
Then why call Him God?

#Pure Comedy
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*~Father John Misty*  

The comedy of man starts like this  
Our brains are way too big for our mothers' hips  
And so Nature, she divines this alternative  
We emerged half-formed and hope that whoever  greets us on the other end  
Is kind enough to fill us in  
And, babies, that's pretty much how it's been ever   since  

Now the miracle of birth leaves a few issues to   address  
Like, say, that half of us are periodically iron     deficient  
So somebody's got to go kill something while I look    after the kids    
I'd do it myself, but what, are you going to get this   thing its milk?  
He says as soon as he gets back from the hunt, we   can switch  
It's hard not to fall in love with something so   helpless  
Ladies, I hope we don't end up regretting this  

Comedy, now that's what I call pure comedy  
Just waiting until the part where they start to   believe  
They're at the center of everything  
And some all powerful being endowed this horror   show with meaning  

Oh, their religions are the best  
They worship themselves yet they're totally   obsessed  
With risen zombies, celestial virgins, magic tricks,   these unbelievable outfits  
And they get terribly upset  
When you question their sacred texts  
Written by woman-hating epileptics  
 
Their languages just serve to confuse them  
Their confusion somehow makes them more sure  
They build fortunes poisoning their offspring  
And hand out prizes when someone patents the   cure  
Where did they find these goons they elected to   rule them?  
What makes these clowns they idolise so   remarkable?  
These mammals are hell-bent on fashioning new   gods   
So they can go on being godless animals  

Oh comedy, their illusions they have no choice but   to believe  
Their horizons that just forever recede  
And how's this for irony, their idea of being free is a   prison of beliefs  
That they never ever have to leave  

Oh comedy, oh it's like something that a madman   would conceive!  
The only thing that seems to make them feel alive   is the struggle to survive  
But the only thing that they request is something   to numb the pain with  
Until there's nothing human left  
Just random matter suspended in the dark  
I hate to say it, but each other's all we got Religion is the main cause of unrest in India. Religion is one intense fandom. Religion is legalised madness

Edit: Thank you for the shining silver kind stranger. [deleted] To all those parents and students who called Moral Science classes a sham, this is why we needed it. Religion is an expired product that has continued to stay. It should have been eradicated or died a while back but has not. If we as species have to reach next level then we need to get over religion. Any existing religion is like Superman, did wonders on paper but doesn't actually exists. “When you call yourself an Indian or a Muslim or a Christian or a European, or anything else, you are being violent. Do you see why it is violent? Because you are separating yourself from the rest of mankind. When you separate yourself by belief, by nationality, by tradition, it breeds violence. So a man who is seeking to understand violence does not belong to any country, to any religion, to any political party or partial system; he is concerned with the total understanding of mankind.”

― Jiddu Krishnamurti


Questioner :  Kindly give a straight reply. Does god exist, or not? Yes, or no? If yes, how best to realize him in this life?

JK : ""If you examine very closely, you have created god. Right? In India there are about – I was told there are about 300,000 gods and more. (Laughs) You understand? Every local person has his own god.

So, sirs, we have created god. See the irony of it. Thought has created god and then thought worships the image which thought has created. Which is, to worship oneself and call it god. You understand all this? – the better part of you is god. Right? I wonder if you understand this. First of all, let’s be clear. Have you created god? The local gods round the corner, or the local god in Rome, or in Tirupati, or wherever, you have created them, haven’t you? You are so very uncertain, aren’t you, so frightened. If you say we have created, then you are scared stiff because you have created out of your fear that. Out of your fear you want security. Right? You want safety, you want to feel there is somebody looking after you because you are afraid. You follow? So you create that, and then worship that. Just see what you are doing! Going to Tirupati and putting all your money in the bag – do you think gods want your money? Sir, look at it all. You have nothing to offer but money, garlands, prostrations, rituals. Right? You have nothing else to offer. Have you realised the tragedy of this, sirs?

If you love – not god, that’s very easy to love god because it is an abstraction, it has not much meaning. But if you love, that very love is god, that very love is sacred. You won’t go outside to look for god. You understand all this, sirs!

And the questioner wants to know if I believe in god. I don’t. Because god is something created by man. There is such a thing as eternity, which is to be outside of time. Right, sir? For that you must have a mind, a heart that is completely free from all the burdens of life. Right? From your vanity, your arrogance, your selfishness – you follow, sir? And we say, we are not capable of it, tell us what to do. You are back in the cycle, somebody to tell you what to do. Sir, you are in a jungle, you have to walk through it by yourself. Right? And for that you need vitality and vigour and strength. Not belief in god, in goodness – belief has no place where truth is concerned. Right?"" If you need divine  reward to do something good or you have fear if you do something bad something bad will happen I think your are a piece of shit. Just be kind to the people help them if you can and for the world sake stop protecting your religion. This post is pure gold!
Religion destroys humanity not build it. All cast system, racism, homophobia and misogynims have their roots in religion.
Just fuck religion and you'll bring out the best in humans!!

God is like that 'Baba' we use to scare kids with so they won't do anything that is denied. \*reads title\* : Ahhh , I see you are a man of culture as well It's really my imaginary friend is so much better than yours. We're not going to get blown out in a supernova, the sun's too little. Religion is a massive waste of time. It has outlived it's utility. This is why i believe in my made up God-

Dovah- A dragon from Skyrim I personally believe that religion is for those weak minded people who can't face the music and always need some kind of support (was one of them). There was this really nice quote from MIB- ""An individual is a smart person. Perfectly capable of making his own decisions, rational etc. but crowd on the other hand is violent, easy to provoke, and has nothing but a common herd mentality."" Now don't get me wrong. I do read sometime bits and pieces of religious text which are some really well thought out philosophical texts but let us be real. There always be a motherfucker who's gonna distort everything and use gullible people to support his own propaganda by exploiting their concept of belief. 

So preach father and preach it hard. Fucking hell fuck all religions. All they have ever done is divided us, and taken advantage of by opportunistic old politicians. And our childish adults should take as much blame for that. We’re literally standing on the verge of global environmental collapse with highest levels of inequality and unemployment with a massively flawed education system and all they can talk about is their mandirs and masjids with no regard for what the future generations would go through. This. This right here!! Fuckkk all religion!!!! The bane of mankind Not just religion, any ideology that overtakes your identity as a human being is dangerous.



Be it the religious wars that were fought, to the dictators who mass murdered people in keeping to their beliefs, everywhere people collectively stood behind an ideology that shadowed their human identity.



Don't believe in ideologies rather believe and hope that tomorrow when a mob of these a$$f##king c@@ts come to lynch you, there'll be atleast one amongst them questioning what he's doing and changes his mind about his beliefs.



Or if you are privileged enough, you could just live in harmony, clapping and cheering, watching while these c@@ts kill themselves. /S Remove religion from schools (prayers) and we have a chance at better future I am going through same frustration bro , where are the so called foking almighty God who are immortal , or are they the ones doing this, them fok them . 
 
Guys tell me one benefit in believing in religion ? Does it save u from these riots ? Which is happening in the name of it .
Does it make people disciplined? Then who are these goons who are Killing in the name of religion ? 

I guess it was just an fiction story written by a man , and later after centuries people started thinking it as thier past and that it was all real . Just imagine after centuries if somehow someone reads marvel comics or harry potter or any such fiction story and actually believe in them thinking it as real thing from past. 

 I wish people one day no longer believes in it . Man made god,not the other way around. [Religion is like a Penis](https://i.imgur.com/V4gTSiO.jpg) We can't ban religions but we should start banning religion backed schools / madarshas Fuck god. I’m better without it. All we are to them are just Paying FANBOYS of their poorly written ""SciFi franchise""...
  -Mr.R0bot(about religion) Wanted to gift an award, but i m poor ☹️. Very well written. I have the same ideology. Hope so people stop this mass brutality in the name of religion. It wouldn't have been a real problem if everyone minded their own bussiness. ""Nothing divides us except religion"" Are you sure about that..? 🤔 Religion is a way for humans to escape reality. It makes people feel as if they are part of something bigger. In reality they are nothing, and they cant accept that. Its way too easy to think they are part of god's plan rather than a blob of hydrocarbons.

Religion is just a theory that was believed for so long that when better theories which proved religion false came along people couldnt accept it. Wrong sub my man. Most in this sub are sensible enough to know this. Should probably post it somewhere where people are deluded. People who are using incendiary rhetoric and inciting violence to meet their agenda are not in this sub. The intricate reality of these cults are far more complex to find a universal solution(for now) than saying ""fuck all religion"" on the internet. Religions will fade away,it will take time though. Until then, it's what it is. If it wasn't for religion, it would be caste or nationalism....for some reason being a human isnt enough and we feel a need to form smaller communities      
Haven't come up with what a possible solution looks like but at the least it should include critical thinking in kids and stopping religious indoctrination There is no better way to make people who have no beef in the first place hate each other to the point of committing genocide than through religion. Religion, is just a flawed philosophy. There's is nothing special in it. Religion is a mental illness. Why on earth would want to associate with them? Blech. Let them kill each other and some day they’ll all be gone. https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190801-tomorrows-gods-what-is-the-future-of-religion

 Rest of the world fighting with coronavirus. Religion is the opium of the masses. Forget about the bloody Gods and listen to what I am telling you - Margery Tyrell A hallucinatic person said something about religion which made so much sense to me. 

""If I don't believe in my imagenary friend, why the hell should I believe in yours?"" ~ Elliot Anderson Good rant I could not agree more - my hats off to my Indian brothers and sisters in the struggle against the zealots Keep spreading the truth.  Let's turn all religions into mythology again. religion was invented by smart rulers to control dumb people, and its something that's sadly never going to change. when you teach a child something, the older they get the harder it is for you to change their mind, and when they have kids of their own they teach them the same thing and it becomes an amplification loop. we live in a world where people take incredible luxuries for granted because thats what we're born with. the modern world allows dumb people to be loud and grab the attention of other dumb people who think the same, something that was never possible before. for god's sake just look at all the anti science movements, you can calculate the speed of light using a microwave and a chocolate bar but if they don't believe it it doesn't exist. people who think this way dont want to know the truth, they want what they think is the truth to be the truth and when that line of thinking combines with conflicting opinions all hell breaks loose. Careful not to cut yourself on all that edge. Disclaimer first: I am 100% an atheist.

Having said that, the problem isn't religion in and of itself.

Most religious teachings usually boil down to 'care about others' and 'be a decent person'. Yes, there's a lot of fucked up stuff in the texts as well, not denying that. But a lot of people find comfort and strength in their beliefs, and you saying they should just let go of it because it's illogical and dumb, is frankly as intolerant as religious fanatics. Religion also does not have to be at odds with science and learning. I remember asking a religion teacher in school which is correct: The Big Bang or God made the world. She told me 'Both. The Big Bang happened, but God made it happen (obvs not something I believe, but not the point is) She also reiterated that the Bible is not literal. And she was a nun. And, as you may have heard, Einstein believed in God too. So, again, it's possible for both religion and scientific knowledge to coexist.

Organised religion is absolutely a problem. In my transition from Roman Catholic to atheist, I had a 'I believe in God, but not in the Church' phase. Religious organisations can be corrupt to the core. People twisting scriptures and teachings to suit their own agendas of hate and power are a problem. People using religion to support ignorance and prejudice that harms others (like being against the LGBTQ community, or anti vaxxers, or sects who believe medical intervention should not be allowed) are a problem. But religious people who use religion to find personal comfort, help others, and be part of a community? There is nothing wrong with that.

Yes, I still believe the world would be better off without religion, because of all of the people who exploit it and do so much harm in its name. But it is not my, or your, or anyone's place to dictate to someone what they should or should not believe in if they are not harming you in any way and just living their life peacefully. Because, again, if you do this, it makes you no better than religious nuts who want to dictate how we live our lives. Amen Stop talking sense. true fuck religion Thank god I'm an atheist. Yes, all religions are fairy tales. Yes, no religion has any definitive proof of being true.

But there is one point people here are missing. Religion does give people mental peace and a purpose to live especially when things are not going their way. While it gives people a false sense of hope that makes them believe that things will get better, it does keep them resilient during tough times. People want easy answers to questions and religion gives it to them. We may be rational in thinking that we can embrace tough times by just moving forward and waiting for things to become better but others are not. They can easily get depressed and go through mental problems.

People who derive pride from their religion go too far. To solve that they need to be educated and given fulfilling work. This won't stop them from being religious but it will at least give them a genuine reason to be proud.

If you want to do away with religion you need to first solve mental health problems.

Just my 2 cents. Exactly. And fuck nationalism. None of us chose these lives/bodies that we are living in. Neither did the person you hate, choose this life for himself

Borders were created by us and it’s something very abstract. Fighting and killing others for something like this seems very stupid to me.

Then I would like to measure several parameters gdp, income, freedom of speech, etc. 

I am really curious what the results will be. It's always been a way to control people. It can be argued that it brought many people together in the good ol' days. The world wasn't so much connected back then. Your entire life would be spent in a 10km radius where it would be rare to find someone who believes in a different imaginary being. So it brought everyone together by believing things larger than themselves.

But the in last century, since everyone is so connected, finding a person who believes in some other imaginary being is too easy. And that's where the human group psychology acts against us and forms groups. It becomes Us vs Them. Religion is unnecessary in our society. But I don't think it should be irradiated or banned.

I think the ideal way to deal with this would be to just keep what metaphysical thing you believe in to yourself. Yes This is why THANOS was right! Wait till you hear about capitalism classism Imagine being an adult who holds faith in their omnipotent imaginary friend as described in a thrice-translated collection of oral histories collected over 1500 years ago, regarding events that happened hundreds of years before they were written down.

You know, the Inuit believe that the earth was created by Raven. The difference: I know ravens exist. Post this on a chintu sub and witness the dislikes Yesss fuck them. Fuck all of them. Every fucking government form I've ever filled asks for my religion. Be it university or a public sector job. I despise the idea that my belief system is somehow relevant to my performance as a student or as an employee. I make it a point to write ""n/a"" in that section, no matter what the repercussions. 

Iirc once a public college even asked my caste. Ffs my caste, and no, not from reservation point of view, just under personal information. Religion is nothing but a tool to control a large number of people by the people in power or those who pretend to be the representative of the religion.
It was used by hitler to justify the heinous crime even tho no sane mind would agree this level of torture for a fellow human.it was used by evangelist Christian Europeans who plundered lands of other n descredited their culture along with subjecting them to discrimination.It was used by isis fighter who were so islamic that they made burkha mandatory for all woman in their area n came with motto to defend islam but themselves raped in every village they went n even killing fellow muslims.it is now being used by the  rss n bjp to polarise the people n antagonize the whole muslim community on pretext of ages old of their own made up history n encouraging lynchings through bajrang dals ,inciting violence.it is still being used by few godmen who even with rape charges against them n property worth of 100s of crore people support them blindly n anybody even dare to criticize them is declared the enemy of the whole community. I feel you man, Im gonna start college this year and am really afraid to go to Delhi to study, all it would take is one person to accuse someone of being a Hindu or a Muslim for a bloodbath that to start that police will probably ignore I truly believe in the not too distant future that the belief of religion will be classified as a mental illness. It’s CRAZY to me that when you go back and read some of the different religious texts it’s chock full of holes and usually rely on “prophets” speaking/ having visions of *insert deity here* to get the message across. That shit sounds like textbook schizophrenia but because no one knew what that was they just accepted it as truth. Now here we are thousands of years later, millions killed in the name of religion and people STILL BELIEVE THIS BULLSHIT. *sorts by controversial,* *grabs popcorn* A fellow atheist popping in,

As I've said before, if God does exist, he doesnt deserve our worship because of the unnecessary suffering this donkey allows in his name or without. God, either shape up and help, or fuck the right off. Religion is like having a dick. It's fine to have one, but it's NOT ok to shove into other people especially children. I'm agnostic, and dislike all religions, but this reads like it belongs to r/iamverysmart. Or r/iam14andthisisdeep Let's get this straight, there are a lot of things that divide us other than religion. It is in our nature to do it. 

Religion is not bad. It's believing that your religion is better than all the others, or your god is superior to the other gods is what is the problem. I am not religious and I agree with you on most points. I want to believe that the abolishment of all religions is the answer to most of the problems of humanity. But, here is a thought. What about the countries with the most non-religious people? China, Czech, UK... Can we really say they are perfect? China has 90% of people who are non-believers. Can we really say they are in a better state than us?

Religion is a problem. But maybe the bigger problem is basic human nature which is to be selfish and divisive. Yes buddy the problem is religion. Not corruption, theft, incompetence, maladministration, colonial laws, red tape, power cuts, absence of health care, undrinkable water, no water, rabies, typhoid, malaria, dengue, PM10, unlivable cities, unsustainable cost of living, ridiculous salaries, sewage in the water, inability of the state and judicial system to catch or punish any kind of criminal at any level, all of which lead to the majority of people living in a permanent state of despair. No, the only problem is religion. Let's get rid of that and everything will be perfect. Great solution. Of course you are right. Nice work. Now go cure cancer b***d. If God does exist, he is having a laughing riot now. 

And yeah, fuck religion. Bruh so edgy, wow. Fuck Christian
Christian: Well, Hello. “If the concept of God has any validity or any use, it can only be to make us larger, freer and more loving. If God cannot do this, then it is time **we got rid of Him.**” -- james baldwin. ""Faith in God is the purposeful *suspension* of critical thinking"" - Bill Maher Also... Fuck Moash I do not believe in any god whatsoever,but I do believe that if people want to,they should.
If something provides them with an anchor,a sense of relief,then why force them out of it?
But of course,I 100% agree with your point of mass killings due to religion,and I'd also like to add to it that the concept of religion has been a major hindrance in our development as well.
All in all I'm just saying if people want to practice religion,they should,but,they should be accepting of other religions and learn to live in peace. I do not believe in this modern world commercial religion shit and have distanced myself from religion since 15 years now.
The thing is, it doesn't matter in India.
I used to live in Gurgaon, and was asked my name numerous times (even in front of my house) by random people who then started fighting(non verbal fights) with me just because its a persian name. 
I live in Toronto now, and noone gives a shit about your religion here (unless you decide to live in Indian/pakistani/bangladeshi ghettos again).
The thing is, it doesn't matter what your faith or philosophy is, when the crowd of fanatics comes at your door, they will kill you. There is no reason with these people, and to be honest its more related to the wealth gap between rich and poor. The poor have rage in them, they have cell phones with cheap internet and big families with nothing to do, so in their mind, power is in numbers and force is only way to get things done.
Seriously fuck this society.
Edit:word Lol looks like somebody just figured it out No matter how peaceful your religion is, the world will never be in peace with religion in it. Religion is the most dangerous disease, weapon and mental illness in this world. The main cause behind most wars, look at world war II, Nazis were predominantly Christians.... Hated Jews for killing their Lord... Thank you for this post. r/redditmoment My opinion on religion?
It was created to control the people. While watching the Hindu nationalists go insane in India this is all I can think about. We have to kill religion. Pakistani here.

We really are in shock over what has started happening.
We send our thoughts and prayers for all of you.

I'm already an athiest who promotes humanity more than anything. 
All religions tell you to do better to gods or entities creation first. This is just ungodly and non human violence.

I hope this ends soon. I hope people get out safe One day religion will die off and humanity will be free from its lies. Religion is the biggest con ever Finally someone who makes sense. I also agree that the religion and the caste system is absolute bullshit Here is the really amazing speech from Mr.Robot questioning religion.


""Is that what God does? He helps? Tell me, why didn't God help my innocent friend who died for no reason while the guilty ran free? 

Okay. Fine. Forget the one offs. How about the countless wars declared in his name? 

Okay. Fine. Let's skip the random, meaningless murder for a second, shall we? How about the racist, sexist, phobia soup we've all been drowning in because of him?

And I'm not just talking about Jesus. I'm talking about all organized religion. Exclusive groups created to manage control. A dealer getting people hooked on the drug of hope. His followers, nothing but addicts who want their hit of bullshit to keep their dopamine of ignorance. 

Addicts. Afraid to believe the truth. That there's no order. There's no power. That all religions are just metastasizing mind worms, meant to divide us so it's easier to rule us by the charlatans that wanna run us. All we are to them are paying fanboys of their poorly-written sci-fi franchise. If I don't listen to my imaginary friend, why the fuck should I listen to yours? People think their worship's some key to happiness. That's just how he owns you. Even I'm not crazy enough to believe that distortion of reality. So fuck God. He's not a good enough scapegoat for me.""

- Elliot Alderson (Mr.Robot Season 2 Episode 3) I agree.

My parents(Hindus) always said that I must pray to God every day and shit like that but honestly, I didn't think there was any sense in that. Even in my school assemblies when everyone would vow their heads in prayer(I went to a Christian school) I would just stand there with my head up. I never felt that there was any use of prayer. Amen I'm 17 y/o and I am sure I can live without your fairytale. Call it bragging but I'm just gonna go ahead and consider myself much better than majority of adult population. I am also a vegan. I have questioned my life far and wide and I think everyone should go through the process of self evaluation. 
Please do it. Do it for us. The future generations. this entire thread is a huge r/redditmoment lmao Religion makes many people look at eachother as sub humans. We dont matter in the grand scheme of things but it is worth it to be good to eachother to protect the little we have. Religion causes so much pain and harm to innocent families. I don't hate religious people at all. I understand WHY some people believe but its just a fact the world would be a better place without it. Even Satanists? 

https://thesatanictemple.com/pages/tenets Atheists are just people who admit we don't know how the universe works but we believe scientists  are closer to the answers to the universe than the priests are. I've never understood the mental gymnastics some of you religious apes use to justify your beliefs. I have highly educated intelligent family members who believe in all the fucking cultural pseudoscience. 

Atheism isn't a choice, it's a symptom of a functioning brain. Amazing. Tell others to be open minded. Then ask them to live exactly the way you want them too. 



Fuck you too Valid points. But my religion has helped me become a better person, treat others with respect regardless of their religion and the colour of their skin, give charity, be a productive member of the society and most of all it gives me hope.

The problem is not religion, its extremism. Religious people are literally patients of a brainwashing cult that has incepted 'anti-human' idea and tradition in their brain All right it's time to address the usual rebuttals.

""We need Religion for emotional and spiritual values""

You can hire a therapist for emotional support and simply buy a good telescope to look at the night sky, nothing is more spiritual than gazing at a clear night sky.

""In 20th century more people died by Nazis and commies who were atheists""

Nazis were not atheists, they were Christians who traditionally hated Jews (even the Protestants hate Jews, just look into Martin Luther's verses). Communists were atheists but weren't just entirely atheists. Its the classic saying, a communist can be an atheist but not all atheists are communist (especially proletarian dictatorship).

""You cannot ignore the good things that religious people do.""

You can do good things without being religious, there's this thing called humanity you know. 

""Being an atheist doesn't mean you're a good person""

Precisely the point, atheism is simply an absence of belief in a God and doesn't explain anything about a person's political or social inclinations. There were and are many bad atheists but unlike theist folks an atheist doesn't need to defend that evil person merely because they share that one specific philosophy.

""You cannot just remove religion like it does nothing""

That's true, religion does offer many good things. But as I said earlier, you can offer all those good things without invoking an omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient God.

""Atheists are just too arrogant""

Theists claim to know the mind of the omnipotent being which created this entire universe and yet atheists are the arrogant ones... Right.

""Religion and atheism are incompatible""

Not entirely true, it depends on one's definition of religion. If a religion doesn't need a God as a criterion then technically you can be an atheist and be part of a religion. Again atheism only means the absence of belief in a God, nothing more nothing less. Amen I think we're stuck between a fake left wing that just wants to appease minorities and a rightwing that wants to install a tyranny of the majority. When the constitution clearly wants us to put aside the religious differences and want common good for everyone, I don't think, we, people are not ready yet to think in such higher terms. After all these years since we said our good byes to British, we only inherited the golden divide and rule policy to keep people invested in their religious sentiments and derive political and economic returns from them. I don't see a near future where people can see through shit and have a true democracy. It's sad, but it's also a painful truth. Chinese are atheists and look at their treatment of Uighurs, Tibetans, Hongkong, Taiwan etc... Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people by marx Well you know what they say: religion is the opium of the masses. I personally vibe the concept of faith and I can definitely see why people would be drawn to a belief, be it imaginary or not to sustain thoughts of afterlife and a greater existence. However, I hate the concept of religion as an institution. Religion has become an institution to control and generate profits and set its own agenda. Its an archaic institution that isn’t needed in the 21st century ʻOumuamua, take me away from this planet You should check out anti-theism. Btw totally agreeing with every single letter. I couldn't say it any better then this. Fuck Hinduism, Islam, Christianity and their other spin offs. YES PLEASE If you don't want to accept death, that's fine. Focus your efforts on achieving immortality. Decide that you will live forever or die trying.

But don't be dumb enough to believe in something that doesn't translate whatsoever to reality. Most people on here would already be atheists so there's no point preaching but just want to say that the world has far more to offer than religion will have you belief and this isn't some short trip in a grand journey. This *is* the grand journey. Do good without thinking of consequences and without shedding blood for any divine powers.

 If there are just gods then they would be pleased with you.

 If there are no gods then you have made the world a little better nonetheless. 

If your gods are displeased because you didn't worship and slaughter for them, then they are petty and cruel and not worthy of being called gods anyway. I can't explain how similar I feel with your thoughts Amen to that Yea exactly I think India should have a religion or no religion column 
Join r/atheismindia Wow i have always been a closeted agnostic. Didn't think there were many people in india with the same mindset. On seeing the reaction and comments here i am relieved. Hey look, an atheist on reddit! Up next, a bigot from BJP! So true
Take my fucking upvote. You only realized this now. Religion is the best tools for power mongers and you know it's another use, yeah you guessed it right, fool the foolish flock. That's the irony of religion   
Long long ago people settled in groups, made their own cultures, lifestyles and called it as religion to bring them closer.   
Now, the same religion is being used to make people apart!   
Sad part is, many can't see it. Religion is the opiate of the masses - Aristotle  maybe Religion is just some really good fiction with a very toxic fanbase I hear you. Also eloquently expressed by [Carl Sagan in The Pale Blue Dot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wupToqz1e2g) Finally the post I was waiting for..
Looks like people are starting to realize the true evil are the religion. I am getting out of these things lately. Religion at best are just fandoms and should not be given any importance in real life situations. Fuck all Humans, worst beings on earth! I have to say I like the singing and the dancing, from whatever religion, but for the rest I completely agree. Religion imo is nothing but a **MASS CONTROL**. People do not fucking respect religion, we are fucking scared from it. Human itself is the scourge of humanity. I have seen the good and bad things religions can do to people. So I see your point but not necessarily. Couldn't agree with you more! Im not that religious anyways, and you seem to have a good point. Religion is the main cause of unrest here, and if people don’t pay so much attention to it, the unrest might stop. Human...is above all religion...Lets practice humanity & co-exist in harmony & make the world  a better place I see, you are a man of ~~culture~~ intelligence as well.

Edit: I've had my share of  participation in atheist groups on the net. Sadly most of them are filled with people who don't know the difference between atheism and agnosticism. r/atheism Religion were made to bring people together in harmony, to share each other's thoughts, to help others out in need of help, but lately due to sheer greed of basic human nature. Religion has become a tool to control the masses and incite hate and violence against others who don't follow same ideology. nice post thanks for sharing George Carlin always had it right - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8r-e2NDSTuE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8r-e2NDSTuE) Everyday I'm constantly reminded that 'prayers' are the single most useless invention of humankind. There is only one god : Time I see that you're a man of logic OP. Just joined, happy to see more people with common sense :3 The only thing religion does anymore is give us more artificial reasons to divide ourselves into tribes and hate each other. Couldn't agree more. Amen to that [Relevant Mr robot monologue](https://youtu.be/NCe8NUK4BjQ) Death to all fanatics! ""Hey if you read history, God is one of the leading causes of death, has been for thousands of years"" - George Carlin I hate it more than you all do. Lol. Cheers Fuck Atheism! How do you feel now? This is exactly how people with religious belief feel after reading this. [I am a athiest myself] Dude just the first 2 sentences were enough I'm Hindu. I chill with my gods and I am with you a 100%. It's not about being from a certain religion. It's about an individual's willingness to not take himself so fucking seriously, sit down, and contemplate his mad life. Who else have watched Man from the Earth.. Religion is how you can trick people into giving you their life.  Religion is the tool used to exploit the masses.  ""Don't worry, this life is just a test run.  Actually, the more you suffer in this life, the more god loves you- the more he can hook it up in the next life.""  Now give me tax free money, please.  Bonus points if you slay some infidel. I have pretty strong feelings about orgasm. Maybe thats what life is about - perpetual orgasm. Religion used to bring people together back in the ancient times to a common mindset so that they can be together, trust each other and work and discover & invent new things and develop various technologies. It used to unite people for greater things. But nowadays the amount of toxicity and hate spreading through religion is immense. Religion is dividing people than brigining them together.
Kinda ironic to its original purpose. What about Dudeism? Didn't know there's a sub for Indian atheists lol. I'm a fan of Indian atheists fb page. They call out all relegion equally, but ppl also get triggered when they oppose NRC and CAB, it amazes brahmin Bhakths don't understand they are standing up agsint discrimination not standing up for a relegion
.

Also why is that our mythology of gods only ever mention animals that exists today? Why isn't there a god with Dino as his vehicle? Coz they didn't dig deep enough to find one and ppl who made yo these back then didn't even know about pre historic animals. Think to yourself........... ""When one person suffers from a delusion, it is called insanity. When many people suffer from a delusion it is called a Religion.""

Robert M. Pirsig I love u Yeah FUCK all religions. People dying over made-up stuff: Very Clever But what currently happening in India is Fascism using Religion masks to divide people.




Yup. The good ol' 'Divide and Conquer'. ""Doubt is the highest form of intelligence"" Religion should have no place in politics All religions are man-made and man is the effigy of mistakes. 

&#x200B;

Hit ^(Up-vote) if you agree the statement! Here here! Thank ""**GOD**"" someone stepped up and spoken the truth, the truth which matters the most in today's modern world.

You deserve every upvote on this post. As Geroge Carlin said the best and I quote - ""Idiots fighting trying to prove to eachother, whose imaginary friend has a bigger dick"". I’m not sure if atheism is the only way. It is a good way to focus on the grand scheme of things, but religion isn’t inherently wrong. I believe it changes are a result of technological advancement. While abandoning religion would work, ‘rebooting’ a religion could also work. I only say this because religions actually never invoke any violence. It’s the understanding of the people who practice it. Granted both are equally hard, but consider a religion such as the religious society of friends. They are a good example of how well religion can affect a society. If we educated people, and had them either further educate or cut ties with people who have immoral concepts, things would improve as well. Not shitting on your opinion. Just giving my two cents. I'll just give my 2 paise:

Religion is a meme. No, not in an Advice Animal kind of way, but if you go by the original meaning of a meme, it is an idea that compels people to propagate it. In this a meme behaves like an organism such as a virus. Thus, religion is a meme.

Another point to support this is that **religion does not exist without people**. Religion NEEDS people to survive, without people religion cannot exist. Therefore, people are more important than religion because people came first. Religion wholly exists in the minds of people, it is not a tangible thing.

1 paisa more: Religion does not only mean belief in some god, IMO even Nationalism and Patriotism can be religions in their own right. Although I agree, heres a clip of [Joe Rogan talking to Physicist Brian Greene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpStPNAB7Cw) on the actual purpose of Religion. Very interesting take and I agree with him too. But most people take their religions very literally. Would you like to join the church of shrek? ""In this world, good people will do good things and bad people will do bad things, but for a good man to do bad things, it takes religion."" I became an athiest due to a few reason but mainly because of eiliot's talk on religion which stuck with me for years, I introspected on it never found a contradiction so I quit believing in my religion. There are a lot more reasons but still.



One of the lines he said was

""Religion is nothing but a poorly written sci-fi franchise that we are huge fan boys of""


""Why are wars fought in his name if peace is what he desires""


The best one

""God is a drug and we are the addicts."" Amen I read a book by Jack Donovan, The Way of Men.

In the book he said that it's man's primal desire to belong to a group, to be a part of something greater than himself.

The teens, and young adults that you see rioting on the streets are fulfilling their desire to belong to something, to fight for something, to stand shoulder to shoulder with fellow men. Everything else is a superficial excuse to act on that instinct.

When you have a large population of uneducated people devoid of critical thinking abilities, they are pretty much zombies acting on instinct and very shallow reasoning, which is evident when you hear those arsonists talk. These people are the pawns, unknowning and unpaid mercenaries of anyone smart enough to rally them. The universe is 13.7 billion years old, the earth only 4.4 billion. What was god doing during those 9 billion years. Also, when we finally get to Mars and other star systems maybe in the future, how will we get to heaven? Where is heaven? Can we go faster than the speed of light going from the other star system to go back to earth and go into heaven of hell? God is fake and made up, evolution is real  and we will all die. Eventually our planet will be unbearable for human life as we know it. Amen to this PREACH!! Op: Babe, can we smash?
OP’s gf: No, I’m waiting til marriage
Op: “Fuck all religion. It’s bullshit” You have successfully summarised the trimmings of your education, and preserved this moment in time. I’m excited for you, not many people get to develop further and then be able to point back to the moment they were so very wrong. I appreciate the effort though, as I used to believe what you have written, so it’s a clear view onto my past self. Well articulated! If I may throw you a crumb of comfort, life would be boring if we had all the answers, so in the future when you read these words again, you may wonder, as I do now, the vast learning opportunities that remain. Is this by any chance in context to the current political situation in India.

Because if it is then it would seem like a very irresponsible thing to project onto social media. Like an ""all lives matter"" kind of argument.

e.g. Saying the same thing in a country where atheists are being prosecuted or where people stigmatized atheists is a noble and brave thing but saying the same thing in China would mean siding with thier current regimes inhumane persecution and rounding of of Muslims in concentration camps)
Not to mention feeding into thier weird obsession with Tibet and who the next Dalai lama should be.

Imagine a Pakistani saying fuck Hinduism and fuck Islam while a hindu village is burned by mullah led mobs. Blaming the oppressor doesn't have to mean you blame the victim as well, and as much as you probably don't mean it that way, in the current context it **seems** a lot like that.

PS: if you're going to bring in the fact that it's not just Hindus attacking Muslims but the opposite as well, I'd want to invite you to remember it's starts in the broader context of the CAA-NRC under which it's fairly obvious who's going to be suffering. r/atheism So I have to ask what's happening in India that got this guy so riled up against religion? Glad that you've out grown religion 👍 This post is GOLD! I totally agree with you All religions are fantasy like Harry Potter but let’s be honest, not all religions are the same, some are worse than others when it comes to coexisting.  
Some Christians and Muslims believe every word in their fantasy book and are influenced by it to hate those who aren’t like them or are homosexuals. Have you ever tried to read and interpret what's written in any religious text like the Gita? AMEN BROTHER Yes, complete agreement.  I call this anti-theism, not atheism. Religion is a tool people use to deal with living it isn’t just about death. Unfortunately we’re not pure logical being. A lot of people with emotions will turn to higher powers in any form. Sadly this message will never reach to the people who need to see this. Among them most will simply reject it. ""Religion is the husk of faith"" -Tao Te Ching Lets all realize that the universe doesn't care because it cannot.  Take action based on our species and this shared planet to protect ourselves by cherishing all life around us.  Resist the animal nature or mammalian ways.  Do not overpopulate the planet assuming only humans are important.  Do not pollute and exploit based solely on your very short life span but instead think of long term life.  We are evolution and each choice brings about rewards or failures for our species.  Lets choose to share with all life and allow room because from what we can observe there is no global, universe consciousness that cares. The amount of scientific evidence for religion and flat earth theory is exactly the same. As a society, we just accept the former because it's been around for so long and is ""tradition"". You forgot 30000-15000 years ago we became best freinds with wolves and they have had our backs since . They have shed more blood for us than you could imagine. Fighting off animals to protect our children and crops and domestic animals. I hate how people thank god when it was dog by our side fighting and dying with us. Damn, you went rough. Before religion there were tribes and races. People always loved to form groups for recognition and unity.Thats just the nature of us humans, removing religion will not stop violence although admitting it is very easy weapon, something else will take its place. What needs to be removed is hate and instate understanding our differences and accepting each other. Religion is to humans is what Modi is to India! I agree lol Too bad Modi doesnt feel the same way. Tbh religion fills in the gaps that makes other feel unimportant as they do not matter to the universe. You can follow a religion and my opinion of you wouldn't go any lower and rather than having emotions that make you feel unimportant it can be good at times. tl;dr

Religion is outdated. But. It fills an important role.

Why are we here? What's next? Why did this bad thing happen to me? Look at all these people, they compete for my education, my job, my housing, my future wife... they are my enemies! Why should I not harm others?

There are a bunch of questions that are very hard to answer without some fundamental truth - or lacking that, something that you accept as fundamentally true. kendrick lamar once said: ""fuck your ethnicity""

thanks

also today is ash wednesday They like to say that religion brought people together. No. It united certain groups of people to become stronger than other groups of people so that they might kill and decimate them. Fuck all Religion. Yes - otherwise religion will fuck us all! Can I have an Amen...!!! Someone get this guy some Jesus in his life ASAP! Well that’s certainly one opinion Look into the church of the flying spaghetti monster.  This is the only understandable religion imo. It ain’t that bad.

I guess it’s because religion has never been a negative thing in my life, and I’ve been lucky to be born into a country that allows me to practice what I want, in a community that is forgiving, and for a family that doesn’t judge.

I literally do not care what my neighbors believe or don’t believe. I agree Thank you, you are better than every god bothering nobody I am glad they burnt petrol pump, at least someone is unhappy because of hiked fuel prices :D Please talk about economy at this stage man please, people were saying the growth rate has been negative but since the 2020 has started I have heard or read no news on how the economy is going. I 100% agree, well said Religion is Politics. Something you use to keep society under control. But I wouldn't use the f word here. Some people are good enough to do things on their own but plenty others need guidance.
And once again a rookie mistake of connecting Deity with Religion. 
The one who follows religion is the one who follows the rules of society. But the one who seeks God is the one who renounces all possesion and abandons the social life. I like this one It is superstition, like ghosts or bigfoot I really really wish Ravi Zacharias could respond to some these comments. It would be hilarious and sad at the same time... I didn't know I had a twin in India. Wishing you a great life friend. Too Right 👏 I completely agree, especially with all the shit going on in Delhi rn Yup, finally someone said it. 👍🏻 Finally someone who gets it and is talkong sense. Religions are one of the biggest cancers of the world right now. And if you really believe the bullshit they tell, i dont know what to tell you... Life isnt a fairytale Now this is a good post! Religion is like spoiled milk. Hey fuck you buddy 👉🏻

MODI GANGGG 🇮🇳 Hoes mad Time to sort by controversial Life was a party till religion came along..

Humans still understood right from wrong because they have emotions... understanding right from wrong is all that matters... If only people have the will and the mind to believe what they actually believed all these years is utter bullshit. I can only imagine a better world without religion. More morale, more discipline, and a whole lot of love. Thank you OP, you are correct. Very well written and I wish you the best.

There are some wonderful Bollywood anti-religious movies available. These three movies are quite funny and a few of my favorites. 

[Dharam Sankat Mein ('Religion in Trouble')](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4354740/?) - *At the age of 55, a Hindu man discovers that he was born Muslim and adopted by a Hindu family.*  It has a score of 6.3 on IMDB; 

[PK](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2338151/?) - *An alien lands on earth and acts so crazy they ask if he's 'PK' which means 'tipsy' or 'drunk.'* It has a score of 8.1 on IMDB; and 

[OMG: Oh My God](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2283748/?) - *An atheist files at lawsuit against God.*. It  has a score of 8.2 on IMDB.

[Here's a list of 7 movies that reflect the dark side of religion.](https://in.bookmyshow.com/entertainment/movies/hindi/bollywood-movies-on-religion/) Those three are on that list, as well as several that look serious.  I just posted asking why religion is a sensitive topic and everyone downvoted and this has 2.9k likes xD Yo what pissed you off to this extent man? If it brings people happiness.and peace of mind.  It’s wonderful.  And it’s fun to think about what came first the chicken or the egg. Who is reading this in 2020? You're a good person for this, OP. I respect your opinion I see that title, I upvote. Isn't it ironic that almost all atheist have a God complex ? Finnaly something I can read...lmao Here from /r/all and I just wanted to say, **hell yes India!**  Your country seems amazing in many ways, but also so damn backwards... TIL that ""atheist"" or ""none"" is not even an option for official religions/beliefs in your country.  When you look at the trends for how humanity is progressing, almost every advance is met by a decline in religion.  
Get that shit outta there!  
And this, from a 'spiritual' person, Buddhist/Atheist, functionally agnostic, and Canadian, for context if it matters.  
May you all be well and happy, may you all be at peace. Congratulations, you've just explained the core of Buddhism!  I'm only partly joking. Buddhism's main tenents are non-theistic and are about abandoning attachment in order to live fully in the moment and see the world clearly.  But I get your point. Man I wish more people could read this. The whole country needs to read this! a wise man once said Religion is the opium of the masses.. any guess who? but in india that ideology is also made a villain by constant propaganda. if anyone can kick sanghi asses its them. The early people realizes the best. What makes me angry the most is that it is killing the scientific temper in our ppl! Preach. Heh.

  


Seriously though. Yes. Fuck'em all. Take it back, Flying Spaghetti Monster is REAL Of course everyone is confused. The universe is infinitely complicated. We shouldn't look down on them for their ignorance. I don't think all religions are bad but I don't think any of them are 100% correct. I do believe there is something after we die. You can't create or destroy anything in this reality. It only changes form. This. Fuck yeah, man. You nailed it; fuck religion! anti-religion and reddit, name a more classic duo They only way to overcome what is happening is Education Education and more Education which is seriously lacking in this nation. Yeah man. All the most horrible stupid people I know are religious. I think it's a direct correlation to not thinking critically and being a blind sheep follower. That's why USA is so fucked up right now. All these idiots believe everything they are told on facebook and white supremacist propaganda sites. Fuck Religion. Finally I don’t know what’s going on in India right now but come on man calm down. A belief is merely an opinion one refuses to reconsider. That, and pride in beliefs is the ultimate in egotism. Let it all go, and people can be free and better. one hundred percent agreed The first part is pretty much what i think about religion as well, it's a very well organized scam to convert people to believe in some bullshit as well as syphon as much money as they can from the individual. Since when a sub about Inda got so smart, you're right tbh Did not expect this post in r/india, kinda refreshing to see this mindset. I am not too keen on religion myself. r/atheism Yeah science is cool! Marx once said, ""Religion is the opium of masses"". I Don't follow his ideology but he straight up was throwing truth bombs in 1800s. Still relevant to this day! As someone who’s never been involved in any religion, I just can’t seem to understand how people can use a collection of stories from 2000 years ago to justify acts of murder and conflict. All religions are just hate groups, but they’re “justified” because they have religious intent. “We hate the gays, but our 2000 year old book says it’s okay, so we are the ones in the right”. Nice post OP, it’s good to know that there is some resistance to the brainwashing that is religion How about fuck the people who cant respect other people's beliefs without murdering them and destroying their places of worship I disagree with the part where you know what happens after death. No one knows it and no one will ever know. Just impossible. It could be a big simulation for example. Fuck all your beliefs as well. Coronavirus knows no religion and likely coming soon. The great equalizer. https://suchanek.name/texts/atheism/index.html Came out the gate swinging There is a Facebook group for atheist parents if people are interested. It’s called Godless Parents. I don’t use Facebook much but wanted to throw out that option. The group is for getting support and ideas on raising children outside of any faith and how to deal with family/friends/schools who sneak it in. Religion shouldn't exist in the 21st century.
It exemplifies human weakness to keep depending on a false sense of hope that doesn't exist.
I hate it to the core, probably this is the one thing I hate the most in the world. All things that further separate us from one another (such as religion) are things we ought to step away from as soon as possible. Finally a person who speaks the truth Ok but who the fuck started imagining blue monkeys and elephants as gods, fucking polytheists Whilst I do agree with everything you said, confirmation bias will insure that your words fall on deaf ears when they are most needed.  Humanity can be both awesome and terrible.  I would like to think the awesome will win out, but I fear it will not.  Best of luck.  Maybe you will get some people to hear your message. Look up a guy named Mark passio on YouTube bro. You won't feel so isolated in your thoughts. Sort by controversial. Don't forget to get your popcorn Here here dear friend!! Ok, but how does that have anything to do with India... I used to feel that religion was the bane of mankind, but I’ve evolved into the idea that it’s irrationality that’s the issue, not really religion. I know many religious people that don’t reflect the worst of their cohort, and it’s trivial to demonstrate that non-religious societies often replicate the worst aspects of religious behavior. What passes for “religion” in most places is really just a combination of bigotry and self-interested politics. Background: I run a humanist, atheist organization, and I don’t like religion. Love of God/ Fear of Wrath of God ..... whichever way you look at it , whats has been significant?:

the pain and misery has been caused becuase of it 
or
the amount of pain it has prevented/ aleviated.

Each will have a different opinion on this.

Maybe we can look at it a different way:

Everything starts out with a good purpose and intentions .... but along the way certain individuals find a way to contort/skew/misinterpret/misrepresent relegion to their advantage and greed.

Faulting religion for the misdeeds of individuals of use it for their greed and gluttony is like blaming the easy target.

The emotional reponse of Love and Hate are equally strong and powerfull.
These miscreants know that faith is so emotionally engrained/entwined in us that we would repond to it strongly.

Triggering an emotional response in us based on hate  is easy for these people.
thats what they are gud at.

Hate these individuals.
Dont hate the faith.

If it was easy to be nice and kind then there wouldnt be any pain and sadness in the world.

it's in times like these that ones needs to find compassion and kindness in their heart for one and all. Based on the current events I am feeling proud for leaving religion. Still my family is extremely relegious but both me and my sibling has permanently left relegion. You too have your religion m8, so shut up! I don't give a fuck what anyone else believes as long as they make the world a better place. Fuck yeah! When it comes to bullshit, big-time, major league bullshit, you have to stand in awe of the all-time champion of false promises and exaggerated claims, religion. No contest. No contest. Religion. Religion easily has **the greatest bullshit story ever told**. Think about it. Religion has actually convinced people that there’s an invisible man living in the sky who watches everything you do, every minute of every day. And the invisible man has a special list of ten things he does not want you to do. And if you do any of these ten things, he has a special place, full of fire and smoke and burning and torture and anguish, where he will send you to live and suffer and burn and choke and scream and cry forever and ever ’til the end of time!

But He loves you.  - George Carlin Amen Oof India is absolutely driven by religion. Remember friends, sort by controversial ;) Thank you! This guy gets it. I agree I like how this was put under the flair politics, because ultimately that is what all of religion is, powerplay politics Yawn. Fuck off. 
Believing in something does not make you any less valid. 
Believers can be just as kind and good for the world as anyone else.
Keep on with your anger and hate, I live each day to the fullest and only think about my religion based on how grateful I am each day. 
You are not special for not believing in anything. 

Organized religion is damaging but the instant you go after people's personal beliefs you become an asshole. I'm a kind person but fuck off. Start with eating beef Edgy Damn, knowing the people on Reddit I fully expected this post to be downvoted to hell. I guess you were lucky Today my exam didn't go well exactly and my grandma blamed it all on my black shirt. They say its not the black colour god day. Honestly am i to laugh or use this fact as an advantage . Perfectly summed up, really well said. Having a religion is like totally not believing in yourself Damn.. Never thought I'd see this in an Indian subredit. Our country is pretty religious.  I've never really met another atheist and we can't be vocal here.  

I must agree that religion is a major source of unrest in India. It's getting scary. I love this country but I can't say I'm proud of it. 

It seems that for every step forward, we take two steps back.  I'm hoping that change will happen and I do plan on doing my part in it. This is lame  Exhaust people loose morals without religion. People say “tHaTs NoT tRuE” but have no evidence for that besides atheist are nice sometimes. You don’t have to believe and people shouldn’t force you to believe but don’t talk bad about it. You just sound like an asshole, like saying “FUCK FAMILIES because theirs a big universe and spending time with them is a waste of to me.” Some people value families like religion so don’t be such a fucking dick about it. I agree that religion has caused nothing but trouble on a large scale. I'm strongly against organized religion because it tries to make claims about the unknowable and dictate how other people should live based on these beliefs. Which is also what this post, and athiests in general, also do yet never seem to realize it. Self aware wolves, the lot of you.

No one knows if there is a God or not. No one knows if there is heaven or hell. No one knows that upon death it's simply black and nothing. No one knows the truth to any of this with any certainty at all. In this regard, atheists are just as infuriating as theists. Both sides make claims about he unknowable and try to dictate how others should live and believe based on their own personal beliefs. What makes them comfortable. 

It takes a tremendous leap of faith to believe in god and a tremendous leap of faith to disbelieve. Neither side is right just because they shout it at you.

Believe whatever you want. Let others believe whatever they want. Recognize you have no way to know who is right or wrong about the unknowable, and leave each other alone when it comes to their beliefs.

The general messages about good character from religion are great. Some people need that from a book, others don't. All religions share the general message of ""don't suck"" and ""be good to others"". Just do that and you're probably winning this game.

Personally, I believe in god completely. I believe in an afterlife. But I completely reject all organized religion because of the reality that no one knows the truth on any of this, along with most major religions having thousands of years of murder, rape, and pedophilia under their belts. I don't need someone else to tell me what to believe or think about the unknowable, especially not someone or some organization with that track record and lack of humanity in direct contradiction to their messages.

Basically, if anyone tries to tell me what to think about the unknowable, theist or atheist, they can piss off. You don't know anything. No one does. Sit down, shut up, and let people believe whatever they want about such things. I wonder what happened to this guy... lmao. TLDR;
I guess the post heading sums it up. I’m with you bro. Fuck all religion except mine./s I fully believe religion is main hindrance to the progress of the human race and people just go around wanting to ‘respect’ others and their ‘religions’. It’s all bullshit. Modi Failed India big time. He failed economy and now Delhi is burning. He needs to act fast and step down before whole india get burned. Anger comes from things you don’t understand.  

One day you will.

Till then stay angry my friend. John Lennon was ahead of his time. I wish I had coins to award this post (unfortunately I don't have any till now lol). One of the best posts I have seen here. Truth!! 💯 You go India man or woman or not determined yet! Religion is a mental illness. Simple. I'm not a big fan of religion either, but I'm also not going to shut someone down if they're using it as a coping mechanism. As long as they aren't a dick about it and are actually a good person, they can use whatever they want to cope. There's worse things than religion. So what if they're afraid of death? I'm happy you're taking that reality so well but some people struggle to the point where their life is seriously impacted, and a small glimmer of hope that is an after life can improve their quality of life. Amen to that you know... some of what youre saying isnt too far off, but on the other hand some of it is fairly ignorant   

  

for example, you state that death means you cease to exist as if it's a matter of fact.  you're certainly confused and I will attempt to lead you toward objective fact as opposed to your opinion.  

  

first thing to recognize is, youre having an identity issue.  you seem to think that you are your body. (you've identified with it)  and when the body dies, it must mean you die too. that's not quite accurate.  you are not your body.  if you lose  an arm for instance, you've lost a part of your body, but you havnt lost yourself.  you still exist.  that's because what you are is something more, beyond name and physical form. so what are you?  well the truth of the matter is, you are life. you are the life allows your physical body to function. and when you, the life, departs from that body it will be dead.  but you can not 'lose your life' when you ARE life.  you just move on to a new form.  

  

no i know this may seem like it took a religious turn as im essentially talking about what is generally known as 'reincarnation', but the simple fact is there's a fuckton of evidence for it.  sure the ancient religions have known for a while, but similar to you, im over religion, i dont find it very useful.  I with off the top of my head I could remember a lot of good sources that show the reincarnation must be an actual thing, as I have seen many, but just to get you started, there is a documentary called 'the boy who live before' I believe.  I could describe it but its better to just judge for yourself.  Basically a child is able to remember his past life, and they track down his old town, old house, family etc.. and its a great mystery how he knew all the details of that old life...  

  

in any case, you right in that you dont need religion.  in fact the just conflate and confuse things, but dont stop looking for answers!  you dont have it all figured out Dont hate the game,  hate the player. Best reddit post ever! Yeah. Fuck it all. Damn look at the amount of foreigners here I don't think it's the religious experience of individuals that is so destructive but institutionalised religion alias the church that blinds people and detaches individuals from what religion really is. I mean, we're making examples of all the war and futile deaths that came as a cause of religion but come to think about it, how many of the people who committed those acts were truly religious. Almost none of the christian community live by the example of Jesus and the bible, they follow it because it's what the mass does and the more you just follow the mass, the less individual you become. 

So let's not say fuck religion.

Fuck the Church. Fuck Creed. Fuck the institution. Word. I'm gonna print this and hang it in my room. Sad but true religion is bad. If Trump can  cheat on 3 wives and still be considered Christian and appointed by god by the evangelical community then somethings something wrong with it. Yeah, yeah, we get it. Anyone with an ounce of ability to think critically can tell that organized religion is magical nonsense. This isn't something that's susceptible to rational argument, however. Your arguments aren't going to change the minds of the devout, and you aren't telling us anything new. Most of the violence in human history has been over material resources or ideology. Got it.

Instead of simply shitting on everyone who feels differently than you do, why not take a more scientific approach? *Why* do most people on earth subscribe to one religion? Why do humans believe in god(s)? Instead of just telling people that they're wrong (with numbers, charts, and diagrams to illustrate the depth of their wrongness,) isn't it time to address the more fundamental, underlying issues at work? Religion isn't something that's *being done* to people, it is ubiquitous, and it appears in isolated populations. As far as I know, there isn't a human culture, now or in historical record, that was without religion.

I suspect that your frustrations are caused by two things: religious or magical thinking, and a willingness to exploit people who rely on magical thinking. The first I find to be strange, and quite interesting, while the second is common and reprehensible. Don't confuse ""the church"" (or any other religious authority) with religious thought.

I'm an atheist, and I've never been part of any religion. I accept most of your position, but if you're willing to ask people to shed their beliefs and adopt yours, why don't you try a little experiment? For one month, learn all you can about one, particular religion. Learn about its history, art, culture, tenets, writings, and if possible spend time with adherents. Go to a house of worship, shrine, temple, or whatever. Set your reservations completely aside for one months, and immerse yourself. Deeply, honestly pursue an understanding. Leave your preconceptions behind (they'll be there at the end of the month when you need them,) and try it. If you pick Islam, pray five times a day. Whatever you pick, stick with it, and keep your critical mind on a shelf, for the moment.

Isn't telling people that a mode of thought is worthless, harmful, and destructive a little bit... wel... uninformed, if you aren't willing to attempt to see the world from their perspective first? What you've said takes guts to say in front of public. Imagine saying something like this in public. Probably the person would get lynched. I too believe religion instead of being a solution has been root of many problems more than often. At least the younger generation in metropolitan cities can accept the concept of atheist and that's some kind of progress, but definitely people need to be more accepting and hopefully that will change in future. Excellent post. Consider the vastness of the universe, with 99.9999% being unobservable to us, and consider the unsuitability of almost all of the observable universe towards life.


Then consider that we exist here now, on a rock floating around in nothingness around a burning hot mass of gasses, hurtling away from all such pairs at celestial speeds spreading out further into oblivion.


Consider the astronomical odds for every event that played out exactly as it did to lead up to us existing here now, and then multiply them with each other to get the infinitismally insignificant chances of us existing, and yet here we are.


Untill we are able to explain how or why, religion will continue to exist. Fun fact: Because of religion killing and hunting all nonbelievers and scientists in the medieval ages and earlier, humanity devolved a thousand years. Think bout that. Shit dog, don't hold back next time. See that guy over there, eating dinner with his family just like us? He's a different religion and deserves to die.

That's how stupid our fucking world is. I think the problem is extremists. I believe everyone should be able to believe whatever they want as long as it doesn't affect everyone else. Why can't people just leave each other alone. The world would be a better place if people just respected each other's beliefs and not shove them down each other's throats. People should be able to treat each other like the human beings that we are no matter what religion or beliefs we have. If your religion condemns something someone else is doing, then leave them alone to be condemned. It doesn't affect anyone else's life but theirs. I'm not religious but I respect what people believe in even if I dont believe in those beliefs because it doesn't affect me in the least. I'm ok with anything as long as it doesn't violate anyone's basic human rights. Extremism is the real enemy. Saw this on popular. C’mon man I’m an atheist but if you want religious people to take you seriously you can’t be aggressive about it The problem is not religion it's religious extremists. Religion can be used for good and bad there is more than one side to it. This guy gets it I wouldnt say “Fuck” all religions, but I would say before you can be anything, you must first be a good human being with a clean heart. OP a lil much, you can be a good person and demonstrate great values all while being religious, some people just are not. I love how the subject is religion, yet these autistic ducks of reddit are talking about America  imperialism in the comments, this has to be the most ADHD social media platform on the planet. I thought I was in r/UnpopularOpinion How did I end up here I support you Bae, fuck all religions Sanket? what a fucking reddit moment Religion is messed up I agree. I do believe in a God as the chances of everything aligning so perfectly for life to be formed is minuscule. You may disagree with me but I'll believe what I want to believe. I dont force it on others and I respect their opinion as long as their opinion isnt like OP's, calling people out and saying they are stupid and dumb. There isn't proof of god but there isnt proof against it either. Lack of proof is NOT proof. Well, damn. Congratulations. Cringiest thing I've read all day I wish we could blame it on religion, but I think humanity would still find a reason to destroy itself. Our nature is conflict, religion is just an excuse. Totally agree.. We humans are the worst creature so brave So glad to see this on front page with 12k upvotes.

How the fuck is centuries old religion still mainsteain in 2020, after we've explored space to such an extent and made such scientific advancements, I will never know.

&#x200B;

Remember the Sun was a deity? Oh, that's a ""false"" religion, got it guys. But that noahs ark shit, pretty hardcore. Oh, you don't believe THAT part? Go fuck yourselves. [deleted] Hail Satan. Thank you for saying this. This was beautiful, thank you. wow very brave! I am not religious but I have to disagree with you. There are a lot of people who need a religion to function. They just go with the rules because they are afraid of their gods but not of other people. They would turn into criminals if they accept that religion is completely made up. Other people need it so they don't feel lonely in this world. Religion can be a beautiful thing but sadly it's used mostly for bad things. Please let other be believers and mind your own business. I don't believe in anything but don't mind other people having a made up God in their life as long they're being respectful to others. If they are not it's because they are raised badly or have other issues, but not because of religion itself. It was made so people behave, to avoid chaos. And back then they didn't had the answer to certain scientific questions and used ""God"" as a simple answer to everything. Some people don't wanna hear the complicated answers and want to live a simple life. Let them be. >Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova. 

Man, they could start a religion about this! Also fuck Modi You forget religion is the only reason humans coordinated on large scale in the first place, without it we would still be barbarians. Not that I believe in god or anything to that effect, humanity would have been doomed without it, but now that we have scientific basis for our actions we are just now approaching a point in time where we *shouldent* need it, so please don’t bash religion too hard, it has its place in our world even to this day. Once someone told me as a kid all the the Greek gods were fairy tales I stopped believing, why is theirs fake but ours real? Religion is complex, I don't know much, but I know religious people who are exceptional people and I know that most have some good philosophys in them. They're probably not suited to our modern age, but their part of our history and culture, so there isn't a need to push it away; maybe to just see it as it is, a belief, nothing more. I have a genuine question, how many people think the world's wars would just stop if there wasn't religion? Do you think the corruption just ends because the veil it's hidden behind is gone, or do you think it would still go on because in reality it's all about greed and power and control?

   My belief is religion is just a tool used to further the end result, and if it wasn't/isn't religion, it's color, or it's geographical location, or it's wealth, or it's because they're shorter, or speak a different language, etc etc there's always going to be some bias that divides people, and there will always be a mask to hide behind to do it. 

  I'm someone who finds comfort in having faith in something because there's a lot left we really don't know, whatever my idea is, but I don't ignore scie xe, and I don't go out of my way to harm people who don't believe, or believe in something I don't. I do agree that the power structure of it should be taken down, and it's disgusting what it causes, but it's the people that hide behind it that are the problem. I tried athiesm but, realized it was also a belief - George carlin Man the edge on this Fuck yeah!! Buddhism actually isn’t a religion that has the “answers” it’s actually about to let go of all the worries in the world like (where u go after u die) and simply quiet the mind  and humble yourself because we simply don’t know!! Insult people in an effort to convince them they're wrong? Solid strategy. Spot on brother man. My “religion” is just treating people like I want to be treated. I know crazy right? Agree on every single points made. Hope more people actually get the message. These man made fairy tales are distracting the masses from progressing together. And instead introducing hatred and twisted views on our own species. Religion has seriously fucked up mankind and its realistic views on the world and created nothing but death and suffering on many levels. And your donation money definitely isn't going to that charity, it's going in father Matthews pocket. As OP said, everyone please wake up. >You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe.

if thats true then just let people believe what they want to believe REDDIT MOMENT im satanist Amen brother! Are indians just now realizing this? Religion is the opiate for the masses Religion is an MLM/Pyramid scheme.  Always has been, and always will be.

Start taxing religious organizations and things will change instantly. Fuck religion. Amen religion isn't really about religion. it's more like political strategy. unfortunately, it works on most people. 67% upvoted , everyone has entitled to their beliefs and that should be. I read an interesting article which basically explained why science can't make countries adopt secularism. Anyway I'll leave a copypasta here:

Religion is like a penis. It's fine to have one, ok to be proud of it, it's even ok to share it with someone if they ask. But it's not ok to shove it down someone's throat against their will!

...and keep it away from children! I mean I don’t believe in any religion but these kind of posts just make me uncomfortable, I think the less you worry about other people’s personal lives the better. Idk why this is r/India but I’m here for the drama! As much as I agree with you, how can you say that our legacy should be to better mankind, when in the end no matter how good mankind is everything ends the same? No one will be remembered for long, no one will will remember if you were a good person or not, so all wrong doing is pretty much as justified as doing the “right thing”. And like you said, spec of dust flying through space, a soon to be (in the cosmic scale) desolate spec of dust just like everything else. So in reality there is no “immortality” for us as you say. Wow... I'm speechless... Sometimes I wonder if trophies like NFL rings, Oscars, nominations, NBA trophies, etc. are just another object people idolize like how people worshipped cows. Kind of sad seeing it happen right in front of our eyes. 'Fuck' religion that **tells people to go hurt/kill other people.** And 'fuck' **dogmatism.**

But on the other hand, your idea that religion is there simply to provide people comfort against ""death"" is not something I necessarily think is proper. For me, some religious afterlives are worse than just having nothing at all - e.g. Buddhist Hells.

>What determines our immortality is not what you did for your religion, but what you did for the future of this little speck of dust flying through the universe.

From a really cold empirical science perspective, you can say, it almost surely won't. And if you're going to adopt that stance, you should be honest about that. Everything gets reduced to entropy in the end, photonic gas, and 99.9999% of us will be forgotten in no more than a few generations at the very best, and the few that aren't had a lot of probability work in their favor to get them there.

If you want to argue for a worldview rooted solely and purely in cold, hard empirical science, then you have to go **fully** honest about it and the things that *really* make me pop my head are not so much things filled up wholly with lies but which have a large quantity of truths and then *one little snag*.

And I'm not saying that somehow ""proves"" religion right. I'm saying that if you are going to argue it this way, you *should be* honest about it.

**Any** kind of *dogmatic ideology*, I find, is poison. It doesn't matter if it's religious or not. What matters is that it does not tolerate dissent. What matters is if you have decided those who refuse it are evil. All political ideologies go the same way, and the toxic effect of treating them dogmatically and intolerantly is every bit as plain as for religion. Interestingly, you have done just that, and said everyone who believes in religion is ""😈evil😈"". Good, I'll keep being 😈evil😈 then. Proud 😈Devil😈 here. Just as I'll keep being ""😈evil😈"" in the view of any other dogmatist who tells people to just suck up their dogma and don't critically evaluate each bit of it with a fine grained comb and I'll almost always find something to disagree with. Including ""religious"" dogmatists, too, of any stripe. Dogma systems are straitjackets for the mind. Any system that one cannot be flexible with or reserve adherence to all its tenets, inflexibly, rigidly, under threat of personal invalidation, is a mental straitjacket and exactly the kind of poison your *legitimate* points rightfully indict.

And believe it or not, saying ""I *believe"" or* ""I *don't believe*"" in ""God"", are *both* actually equally and more honest than saying ""I *know*"" the answer to this, or asserting it as an absolute fact. There is a hubris in both believing that we can *know* beyond the limits of our sense and empirical experience, as much as there is in believing that actual reality must be coterminous therewith. Neither such statement or confidence can be justified based on reason. We can only justify what we *have* verified empirically, and anything past that is where we must cease to condemn and chastize disagreement. In full honesty, we cannot even *know* the ""laws of physics"" continue forever. Our empirical evidence, our *experience*, gives us no reason to *suspect* they will break, and can give us *confidence* in them, but they just *might*, and maybe there are places they don't apply that we haven't found yet. One can, of course, pull out the Russell tea pot argument and say it's irrelevant, but my point is not to argue its relevance any more than its correctness, but rather to argue against your moralism of people, which is as reprehensible as that which has flowed from the mouth of any authoritarian religious preacher in any religion.

People should not be considered vile for *whatever* they believe in this matter. I have no problem with you going for atheism, I have a **big** problem with you calling people evil, simply on dint of a *belief*. **That** is what leads to all the horrible things you rightfully indict.  You or someone like you may become the next persecutor. The only way to stop persecution is for everyone to respect disagreement.

And no, I'm not then saying ""persecute the persecutor"" or ""persecute the ones who say people are evil"". I am voicing both my own disagreement and my intent to not be daunted by your taunts. Some thousand years ago, the purpose of religion was not to create chaos as it is today, rather to create a civilisation and induce fear of God so that man may not commit wrong deeds.

Today, we have nations and better human development systems like schools and universities and hence we don't need religion.

I always say, religion is a tax which we are paying.

Now, not having a religion does not mean god does not exist, and if atheism is based on the belief that God does not exist, also give rise to a religion where people believe unequivocally on the non-existence of a non-existent.

So, it is better to have God but no religion. I used to think this was true. But recently I've realised that religion is just a stick for people to hang their tribalism and prejudice on. 

You could remove all religion tomorrow and we'd find something else to fight over. In fact you can already see it in politics and things like Brexit. 

The troubles in Northern Island were labelled as religious but really they were territorial and tribal. I'm pretty sure it's the same in the middle east. 

Religion just gives you a rule book or some easy way to pit yourself against someone else. Fuck religion I agree with everything this enlightened gentleman said. People need comfort, religion gives them comfort.

People need to feel good about themselves, and religion makes people feel good about themselves (at the expense of others) Yes. This. Religion is a distraction from any complexity. People hate people because <insert your text here> [religion, caste, race, age, gender, national origin, color, ethnicity, political views... Etc etc] Religion was invented by power hungry elites to control the generally ignorant population. I second this. I'm an ex Muslim Indian. Fuck ALL religions. You know what, amen to this! In bible first murder was also to get recognition from god... But they dont see that.. The thing is if the God didn't meddled with Able and Cane's life for getting sacrifice.. the story would have been different... ya, but as the people join atheism, they will use that to oppress the one with religion. Religion is not the problem, people using it to their advantage and manipulating others is. If you think joining atheism may do some good, wait till some atheist goes and beats up religion following people.

I don't think any religion serves hate, and those who really practice religion are not goons. 

sorry for bad English and typos if any. I am gonna come back to this and gain my sanity when I seem to lose it. Thanks! Care about yourselves and the people around you. We build this world, not God or anything else. We don't know all the answers, but we will find them step by step. I’m not a religious person but is this is such a Reddit tier post. Genghis khan didn’t kill millions of Chinese and Iranians out of Tengrism. Tribalism is inherent to humanity, we will always find a reason to divide and hate Humans observe something.

Humans try to explain that something. 

Humans fail to do so.

Humans create imaginary power to explain thing they failed to explain previously.

BAM religion.

Now, humans do science.

Now, science succeeds in explaining things that were previously unexplainable.

Now, despite having scientific evidence and explanation of stuff, (some) humans still believe in religion instead. 

&#x200B;

Science and religion cannot coexist. 

Religion must be excluded from politics in and shape or form.

Anything that has to do with religion should not be supported financially by the state and therefore by taxes. All financial support for anything religious should be shifted to support causes which are based on science.

&#x200B;

everyone should still be free to believe in whatever he or she wants. No one should get any disadvantages from doing so, but (and that is the important part!): no one should get any benefit from doing so either. And everyone who tries to manipulate anyone else in believing into something that he or she does not yet believe in, should face trial for religious missionary work, which should be illegal to begin with. Being Atheist and being a human is the best thing to be in this world. Amen! EUPHORIC Preach brother! Can't we just use some made up religion for ids like dinkoism or the church of flying spaghetti monster? I applaud you for your courage. Hopefully India breaks free of it's chains and can finally start being a secular nation, or at least, a nation where the separation of Church and State is upheld.

Good luck to you and your country friend. I've been calling myself a Hindu atheist for 3 years now, since the age of 15. I was proud to belong to an ancient culture of tolerance, peace and justice. I was proud of our customs, ways and multiple traditions, hence I called myself a Hindu atheist, even though I rejected all religion and their philosophies including Hinduism. Today, I no longer want to be called a Hindu. I no longer want to associate myself with tribalism. Religion is a threat to life. Religion is organized crime. Religion does not belong in developed societies. Religion is the preamble to barbarism. No religion can take moral high ground. Fuck Religion. I officially denounce hinduism. Those many medals are giving me anxiety . Oh my god .

🤣 Imagine there's no heaven

It's easy if you try

No hell below us

Above us only sky

Imagine all the people living for today

You may say I'm a dreamer

But I'm not the only one

I hope some day you'll join us

And the world will be as one

No need for greed or hunger

A brotherhood of man

Imagine all the people sharing all the world, you


You may say I'm a dreamer

But I'm not the only one

I hope some day you'll join us

And the world will be as one Nicely written, it will hit the ""Fake religious ego"" named as ""Religious sentiment"" of the religious extremists.

I'm not an atheist but I love when the ego of any religious extremist gets hurt, I just absolutely love watching their so called ""religious sentiment"" getting hurt because all these morons have ever done is distract everyone from the real problems, cause riots, hurt human lives. you just put my thoughts into words.. happened to stumble upon this and thank you. I thank OP for posting this. I feel the exact same way . Glad to see someone vent it out I wish I saw this when I was like 8 I was already a non believer but was to scared to tell anyone Happy that you said it and the kind of response it got. Opium of the masses as Karl Marx said. I agree, from the uk >None of your religions are without blood in your hands. 
Buddhism enters the chat Yes my friend! A thousand times yes! Edgy I kinda respect religion but yeah I feel you Science flies you to the moon, religion flies you into buildings. From the series Mr Robot

He's not a good enough

scapegoat for me. Edgy. So edgy. I think we're stuck between a fake left wing that just wants to appease minorities and a rightwing that wants to install a tyranny of the majority. When the constitution clearly wants us to put aside the religious differences and want common good for everyone, I don't think, we, people are not ready yet to think in such higher terms. After all these years since we said our good byes to British, we only inherited the golden divide and rule policy to keep people invested in their religious sentiments and derive political and economic returns from them. I don't see a near future where people can see through shit and have a true democracy. It's sad, but it's also a painful truth. You're a horrible person for telling people what they can and can't believe in. Religion is one of the reasons this world hasn't completely gone to shit. Keep your horrible opinions to yourself, no one cares what you do or dont have to say about others beliefs. [I like to watch this scene from Mr. Robot every once in a while](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DSQHJXtfpE) Bhai everyone here already knows all this. If your intent of writing this post was to make people ""woke"" then you should post this on family WhatsApp groups. If your intent was just to rant, well, then let me tell you that we already understand this perspective. Yes, by all probablility, God does not exist, and even if He does, it is of no consequence since God doesn't interfere in any way we can see. However, I strongly disagree with your notion that religion is the 'root of all evil'. History proves that religuous societies tend to be more successful, likely because people tend to shy away from crime or disobedience if they feel that 'a higher power is watching them.'

More importantly, religion provides us with hope, something to be happy about and look forward to in grim times. What if there were no Christmas or Diwali or Eid? Life would be rather monotonous and dull. The greatest works of art, literature, music, even science were inspired by religion, be it Sufi ghazals, Rennaissance frescos, or Hindu epics. Yes it is true, communal tension and xenophobia is largely a product of religious extremism, but ultimately, religion has done more good than harm.

In the 'grand scheme of things' religion and humanity itself is undoubtably insignificant. However, by pusuing that train of thought any longer than necessary, you end up living a sorry nihilistic life. Instead, it's much more prudent to enjoy the culture and vibrancy associated with each religion, rather than getting swallowed up by fanatacism or depression. 

Religious texts are some of the most enlightening philosophical pieces ever written if you take the time to understand them, and if you've actually read some, you'd realize that it's not the crap about a 'One true God' that is meant to be read, but the centuries of moral and ethical teachings poured into them by countless 'spiritual' leader i.e. basically just modern-day philosophers. Buddhism is actually nice bro. Buuut yeah we get your point. >Fuck you all for believing in this made up bullshit called Religion.  
   
You do realize that everything is made up bullshit. Including ideas like 'equality', 'liberty', 'money'. Things like equality are fantasy born in some human minds. Just like religion. But we embrace it.   
   
The only reality of our species is 'survival'. Thats the only reality. Everything else is fantasy. Equality, religion, discrimination, liberalism, etc. I believe in religion. You can have your own opinion.

If you don't believe it's up to you but claiming that no God exists is more irrational (even mathematically) then saying God does exist.... I understand your sentiments. 

But, tell me, if you're so insignificant, why should anyone listen to you? Why do you feel anger? What special rights do you have? Why not cull humans who don't deliver value to society? Why not go killing each other anyway? It's a one time fun.

Do you realize that the sense of greater good, a belief in rising higher is what sustains us and religion is a byproduct of that?

And you're not able to prove, nobody is, that humans are insignificant. Neither are the religions able to prove that there's a heaven or hell after death.

But the mystics of every religion, who have refined their minds, have philosophies that logically convince us that humans are a superior expression of the force that created the supernovae. OH GOD THIS GUY Okay, I understand where you're coming from. But don't shit on other people's belief, that's pretty rude.

If you wanna shit on anyone/anything shit on the people who differentiate and spread hate based on religion, culture etc etc. Religion helped us, Sapiens, shape our world as it is today. It's a fact that we need common beliefs, be it religion, fiction, science or any other imaginary concept, to work our way up together.

Religion has played its role in bringing us so much further than we expected.

It's sad to see something that was supposed to help us work together, build and design our future has taken a wrong turn into violent extremism and foolishness. Somebody finally fucking understands me. 
I am a 15 year old atheist. I hate that God Who created all the trouble between us. He never existed. So what's the meaning of science if he fucking exists.!?

Fuck you All Religions Well said buddy. This was a good read. Live and let live.. keep thy religion to thy fucking self. Simple fuckin rule. 

They have used this card for far too long to stay in Power.

I do not believe in karma or a higher power, but to be fair I hope who actually caused this! The hate speech deliverers and the people in power who could've stopped this would get the justice they deserve. 

Really shameful to call myself an Indian. religion is the most damaging thing to ever plague humanity. i will never understand why even in 2020 the populace refuse to acknowledge the damage. i want to believe we will someday grow beyond it, but we already should have and the evil might plague us even for another 5000 years. i'm sure there were people who understood this 5000 years ago, and they lost hope for this world same as i do now. If there can be a ""prefer not to say"" for gender, why can't we have a religion that can have the same ideology. Excellent....been waiting for this one. 👏👏 Join r/atheismindia Buddhism is not intended to be a religion my friend, but I agree. Still though, the whole part about being insignificant and matter and the universe and all that, that was very Buddhist lol.

Just to clarify. Buddhism in its core (without all the religious mumbojumbo) is about accepting that everything ends and chilling the fuck out about it so you can be a nice person whos not driven by the constant need reduce your fear of death by indulging in activities that get you nowhere.

But yeah, fuck religions. I am an Atheist and i made my Whole Sikh Family Atheist, let's change them one at a time. My religion is responsible for less death than yours -Andh bhakt I would like to use this to promote r/atheismindia May I propose creating a new sub called /r/indianatheists?

Edit: Looks like it already exists but is restricted.

In that case, I've created r/atheistsinindia Corona virus in India took 0 life.
Guess how many lives the religion virus took? I didn't know there were so many atheists here, lmao. Happy to know that someone knows the truth. I think this belongs here :

When a thousand people believe some made-up story for one month – that’s fake news. When a billion people believe it for a thousand years – that’s a religion, and we are admonished not to call it ‘fake news’ in order not to hurt the feelings of the faithful (or incur their wrath).
          ---Yuval Noah Harari What you are offering is not a solution. But another label that people can put on themselves. And create separate factions with people identifying as this label. Just because you don't pray to a ""made up diety"" does not make it any less religious in a way that truly matters.

Religion is far greater, deeper and broader than you can imagine. Religion stems from a need in humans in general that is fundamental to human nature 

> Fuck all religion. Fuck Hindusim, fuck Islam, fuck Christian, fuck Buddhism. Fuck you all for believing in this made up bullshit called Religion. You know what I think about your religions? I think it is a waste of time, I think it is just another fairytale for childish adults who cant grasp the concept of death. They all want to just believe in something good after death. Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing. Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova

I am sure you feel superior somehow. When you curse the religions. Or doubt the sanity of people who follow religion. Or quote random scientific facts as moral arguments. You feel good about it. And you feel that you have found the true path. The path that lesser people don't get, and it is your duty to preach this path to these people.

Sure go ahead. You are free to do so. 

But starting by abusing and disregarding the competition is rarely a recipe for a successful business. Just an analogy. Don't mind me. I am just here to read all the comments............ Trust me the only reason of making religion is to limit the thinking power, iq of a common guy

The same reason is with free internet and free surfing, our perception is made to be controlled by someone else.

AI will take it to another level. Intelligent people are the most difficult people to   govern Wow, very brave post. Let us rise up, gamers, and overthrow the Religion! While I agree with you on religion, I find it really funny when you said. 

>the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing.  

The reason I find this funny is because the only way you would actually know this is if you died, experienced it, then returned.  Else, you are just taking it on faith that that is what happens when you die.  

Sure we all know what happens to you body when you die.  But there is literally know way of knowing you stop existing. 

This is why I’m agnostic.  I also don’t believe in organized religion personally.  But I don’t judge people (like you are) for their beliefs, I judge them for who they are. 

This post is no worse than what you are hating. Been trying so hard to tell this to people but damn, I get heat from religious people. They hold no bars either. 

I feel like religious people are what is wrong with this world. If there is a God, well he can go fuck himself. Send me to hell. As a Hindu living outside India... this is really sad to see. The only connection I have to India is the fact that I’m a Hindu. Congratulations on throwing away 3000 years of rich history. Fuck this post sounds exactly like my existential crisis and almost had a panic attack reading it The reason why what you wrote lacks validity is that you talk only in great generalities, and that's where the falsehood lies. What you are referring to as ""religion"" could refer to a very wide and complicated range of human behaviors, cultures, ideas. Your conclusion is really the height of arrogance because you think you're the expert in a bunch of things you clearly know very little about, and in spite of your ignorance you want everyone to follow what *you* decree from your own self as an ideal culture, belief system, behavior, etc. The way you wrote your post, you're acting like you're some freaking prophet come to deliver us the Truth. Sit down, son. Try studying and learning more so you don't sound so ignorant in the future.

By the way, how old are you? 15? You seriously think you're justified in telling all humans on Earth to leave their wisdom and value systems just because you know grade-school level science and history?

>We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion.

This is very easy to disprove.

>As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better

Practically speaking, this did not happen. Scientific discoveries in history and advances in technology enabled humans to commit the greatest atrocities ever before witnessed.

>but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed

Baseless assertion, easy to disprove.

You arguments are also hypocritical, because it's just as simple (but equally wrong) to assert that atheism is evil. The greatest instances of mass murder in human history were deliberately carried out by atheists or people following anti-religion ideologies. Fuck religion! RELIGION IS TERRORISM!!!!! This post only shows, how arrogant and actually disgusting atheists can be. i could take my time and dismantle every part of it, but you are definitly a lost cause. >You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter. But matter itself is being part of this universe

To main kya job chod dun fir. Important transitions in history are seldom driven  primarily by human wishes. - The Sovereign individual Well, at a certain level, everything is insignificant, which doesn't mean they need to be eradicated. Everybody is entitled to their view, and if that's your view, then so be it. It's an anthropological tendency to form cliques, and humans have evolved this way. It's ""natural"" to not be a pariah. I'd like to go one step above and point out that rather than religion, it's any **-ism** that ends up creating an 'Us vs. Them' at scale and ends up creating the same problems as religion. That's more down to human nature. Religion is something a lot of pacifist humans would like to point as increasing human misery. I'm not saying OP is wrong, he/she is right, to an extent, just that religion is the low hanging fruit in the 21st century. Even **Greed is as bad as Religion** but rarely do humans write gilded posts about **Greed** on this sub (may be there on other subs).

Ironically, most world religions advocated harshly against greed but look where we've all ended up. Is religion the real root of the problem or is it just the **enabler** for flawed humans ?

If it weren't **religion**, it'd simply be some other -**ism** instead: Capitalism or Communism or something else. Humans, in general are not wired for contentment - That is our blessing as well as our curse.

Almost all humans are also wired towards some form of **group-ism**. That's what helped us survive and proliferate as a species (i don't mean individual survival but at group level).

In old days, religions (or more of **shared ideas and traditions** than **polarizing religion** as we call it today) actually helped groups (again, not individuals) to exceed the Dunbar number amongst other scientific advances. While this was perfect for handling large groups where a lot of people don't know each other, not so great for peace when 2 different groups encounter each other with different perspectives of life. That is when religion as we know it today becomes - more of a liability and less of an asset.

So what's the solution ?

**Change human nature to be less power-hungry and greedy and more pacifist across all cultures** \- Easier said than done. That's actually the reason no-one wants to be the first to become pacifist, if your group is relatively peaceful but the other side doesn't care about peace, just greed & resources, well then your group is history. I'm atheist but I think its foolhardy to believe that if we take away religion we'll suddenly be in utopia. It's better to face the fact that life is hard and try to incrementally improve rather than believe there's a magical cure. [removed] Bahut hi badhiya likha gya, badhai ho iske liye.

The problem today isn't religious differences.

Free market capitalism and liberalism promised a bright future, which hasn't really materialised. Since the 2008 crisis, there is widespread discontent globally, which is leading to a rise in extremism.

Yes BJP plays a communal brand of politics and flames the fire whenever it can, but that's not the whole picture here. In our country it is taking shape as a communal issue. Religion is just the top most class in a hierarchy for classification.There will be always something to classify humans,right now it's name is ""religion"". There was a philosopher who argued that mainstream Religion caused less violence, as it brought smaller groups into one large group, rather than smaller groups constantly fighting amongst themselves. Not sure I agree with this, but an interesting viewpoint Dunno have you tried religion without casteism?

Seriously tho, there is a south park episode along these lines. Actually it's a 3 or 4 partner where cartman goes into the future to get an x box. It involves talking otters.  “Certain linguistic anthropologists think that religion is a language virus that re-writes pathways in the brain, dulls critical thinking.”  - Rust Cohle (True Detective). Amem brother. Well, TBH, there is a reason why religion works, but people seemed to have taken it beyond that.

Religion is an extremely effective way to buil faith in oneself and his work. 

Faith and belief are Powerful things. It's like a substitute for people who can't believe in themselves. And they've become so deep in the idea of this God helping us throughout life, that thinking otherwise would be inconceivable. i do not think this has to do with Religion, religion is just a cover for people to form groups. Humans being social animals tend to create groups , we see ants of the same species fighting it out to the death in wars, we see lions killing the young cubs to make the females receptive, and do not even get me started on the closest relatives of ours Chimpanzees, i saw a documentary where they literally beat to death and primate of another troupe just because he entered into their territory and proceeded to canibalize him. 

In absence of religion we would just find something else to group  , be it race or region. Is atheism a religion? Buddhism? Come on man, all you're doing is giving thanks for the teachings I used to think like you sometime back. Then I realised we would find reasons to divide ourself and then fight over it. Even in a world without religion there would be something else to divide us by and fight over. Proud atheist here. Absolutely loved reading this on this sub. Ngl, I was expecting a lot of backlash in the replies, but damn, I'm surprised to say the least. Feels good to see so many fellow Indian atheists.

Thanks for the sub recommendation. :) *nidharma vabha* Mahler tho All I'm saying is a gun can't kill a person and everyone's always said religion is for interpretation I'm personally not religious but to say it's shit is pretty stupid. I think most religious books are pretty well written and give great moral stories Pope's rapes children but that's not the study of Christianity. Well you haven't heard about jedi (the religion)........ Yes its a real recognised religion in new Zealand. Yeah man that is like, your opinion. Cause starting with “fuck you” is a great way to open people’s minds.... What did the Buddhists do? Isn't buddhism about self improvement of ones relationship with self and nature? Honestly, I'm atheist and know little about buddhism aside from a religious studies class I took in college but from what I've seen Buddhists are more about preservation of nature and self which doesn't seem bad (comparatively at least) to me. The sun isn't big enough to supernova though You guys are clueless. Religion automatically declines with increase in wealth, as it has in the West. 

The solution is to focus on improving the economy, which our government is also clueless about I totally get where you are coming from and I agree that most of religion is outdated, but I do not believe that it is pointless. My grandma is 70. She has nothing in life remaining other than religion. She would be sitting at home right now just letting her body go to waste but instead she goes to the temple every single day. It gives her purpose. Does that make her weak or a coward afraid of death? I think not. You might have come to terms with the fact that this life goes nowhere and just comes to an end, but it is not an easy concept to grasp. And it gets more and more horrible of a thought the closer you get to death when your body is in pain and your friends and family are withering away. 

Religion provides two things: community and a moral code. Community in the sense that even if you go somewhere where you are out of place, you will find a small group of like minded individuals through the local church or temple or mosque. It is kind of a support system, an extended family. And most importantly, it provides a moral code. Not everyone is born a genius with a perfectly set line on what is good or bad. It is taught. Which is why you can see certain traits throughout religions communities. 

The problem with religion stems in two things: outdated logic-less rituals and religious supremacy. For the first point, there are outdated rituals like not letting females cook or go to the temple during periods that need to be understood and shut down. In the past, when people did not have an understanding of periods and females speaking up was taboo, this ""rule"" made them exempt from their most important daily duties- cooking and going to the temple. It is of course not relevant anymore because people actually talk about periods and understand them and husbands aren't going to force their wives to cook when they are in pain and just need to rest for a bit. The second, and more harmful problem, is religious supremacy. Christianity and Islam actually believe that they are the highest form of religion and their path is the only true path. This is obviously a toxic mindset which belittles everyone else and also why there are religious missionaries trying to convert people into their religion. Hinduism is actually a very inclusive religion that says that there are many paths in life and you can be a good person no matter what path you choose. Unfortunately, this concept is getting lost on a lot of people and hence why we have seen a rise of hindutva.

All I'm trying to say is that here can be a little more nuance than ""fuck religion"" or ""this religion is the only path to salvation"". Word. I understand how you feel man, but what if, you’re wrong? I’m a Christian, I’ve study the Bible. From my point of view, there’s lessons and a lot, and I mean a lot of symbolism. I believe in science too. But sometimes I think about how did the universe start. That’s something I think people have no idea or have a clue on how to think about. They’re all theory’s. The universe is so vast and to think of it as 3 dimensional is pretty incomprehensible. But with my understanding of the Bible, it’s humanity that greatly distorts the underlying message of it.

But if everything is blank after death, I’m fine with that too because there’s versus in the Bible taking about getting some rest and I’m fine with that too lol Friendly reminder- there is still a large number of jews living in Germany today, but it was Hitler who shot himself to death I'm agnostic, but saying that if there was no religion, everyone would be happy and peaceful is plain wrong. Unfortunately we are social beings and so we tend to form groups, be it religion, colour, language, class, culture etc. And sooner or later groups will start fighting with each other. It just so happened that religion became a major cause of conflict You need to take some psychedelics and afterwards you’ll sound silly to yourself saying there is no afterlife/soul. I’m not saying it exists, I’m saying that we as ‘smart’ primates are too stupid to know and as you said we are so insignificant that how can we as a disease to our planet know what happens after death. We cannot and will never know. Just a thought :) > We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion.

This is not really true. Ethnic and class identities also divide us. They are probably far more serious than religious differences. How is this post not about a ""religion"" you guys calls ""atheism""?
You are calling all the religions stupid and people believing in it are childish. But on the other hand you are so intolerant to all religions and wants everyone to believe in your beliefs that you were an early man then learned basic skills and tools.
Why you want every religious person to believe in this and not in their scriptures?
Atheism is the most intolerant belief.
Humanity is not about stopping everyone to believe in their beliefs it's about coexisting with tolerance, caring, and respecting each other's opinions, beliefs, actions as far as they are not harming the others. Lots of things divide us that aren't religion. Intelect, socioeconomic status, working class and white collar, sex, politics. Religion is definitely not the only thing. The problem comes with religious institutions being too big and having too much influence over people, not the specific religion in and of itself. I can see though why people wouldn't want it and how there are definitely some religious people that need to wake up to sone sense of reality. Just want to point out that Buddhism wasn't supposed to be a religion, but more a way of life (or a way to get through the suffering that is life)

Admittedly that isn't always the case now, but please don't go hating on all Buddhists.

Also, Buddhism is frequently mixed up with Taoism, which most definitely is a religion. No thx We aren't sure yet whether early religion lead to urbanization (towns and cities), or if those communities lead to religion. It appears that religion came first and actually helped bring us together. 

I get your anger at religion. Except religion is just a tool. Would you blame the knife or the one that wields it. 

Obviously that's an oversimplification of a more complicated issue. 

Attacking people angrily whether verbally or physically isn't go to make them change their beliefs. They're going to dig in and fight back. 

If you really want things to change do it peacefully. I seem to remember a man from India doing just that, and he happened to be religious. What happened that got OP mad? But you know, this is just ur opinion man ok Don’t tell me what to do Well bro, you might want to read Sapiens by Noah Hararj.. explains exactly the need for religion. How it is has been important throughout human history as a way to band people together behind a myth. I myself honestly don't need a religion to respect another human and work with him/her. For me, I sometimes feel that the need for religion has run out its time. But reality is often different and you need to respect every religion and the people who get behind it. Why is it that when a black person gets offended, they try to involve more of their black friends to help gang up on you and leave you no room to talk by being loud and obnoxious? Can they not fight their own battles? Religion can be considered uncessecary, but I feel it's a decent way to teach basic morals that sometimes parents fail to do. Growing up around in a city full of mormons, that's probably the one thing I appreciate from their cult. Not to mention religion is a good outlet to experience and understand a lot of cultures. But yeah the beliefs are fucked Amen!!  Preach brother!! I loled hard when I saw the link to the atheism subreddit in the end. Kinda out of place I felt. I know you're angry because of whats going on but this an emotional argument against religion, not an objective one. You've claimed many things, and several are without proof. You've claimed other things, some with truth. You are entitled to your opinion to hate religion but the reality is we are an insignificant spec in the universe and you don't have all the answers to many of the points you have said so you say ""fuck all"" to it. That isn't a logical solution.

What is logical is to understand why they hate and to fix that. You say religion is whats wrong with the world but you also fail to mention at lack of religion. Look at athiest China and Soviet era and see what they've done. And no this isn't an argument against athiesm, but it is the same point people make when they say thiests kill people over thiests. Besides that, lets be honest, I doubt that the hindu or Islamic scriptures incite people to actively go fight and kill people unjustly and I sincerely believe you don't believe it does either. Many of these hardliner terrorists are uneducated in their own religions and common education, selfish, and just plain pieces of shits that need to die. u/motapi Buddhism isn’t a religion, it’s a path and doesn’t believe in any god. Buddhist can believe what they want but at the core the only thing that makes someone a Buddhist is if they follow the 8 fold path and strive to attain enlightenment Nothing like telling us to open our minds by telling us how to think.

>Religion is evil and makes all its followers evil by extension. 

Objectively evil? I think you get a good idea about religion and beliefs when you watch the ending of Bhool Bhulaiya. Pretty good watch. Will recommend >""be loyal to your species"" . What about other animals & beings dwelling this planet? Isn\`t that the root cause of the problem, serving and taking care only for ones ""believed or look  like our own?  The foundation of all the evil you had pointed out above in the world religion, the selective goodness?

 A person with ""**kindness**"" as a dominant trait would shower it for everyone alike,  as a flower cant be selective in spreading its fragrance to  the audience of its choosing.

Humans are consciously evolved beings, powered by probably the universes most sophisticated nervous system, & backed by a vast database of genome & cellular memories. 

They can discern, choose consciously,  exert intent, they posses great will power, have the ability to introspect and make discoveries. 

That innate power or toolkit is granted to almost every being born of the human womb. No matter the prevailing economic condition, race, geography, or any other external circumstances, this set of toolkit with optimum functioning is available to everyone by birth.

Example, ever ask a child or toddler to kill a bird or conduct this act in-front of her, and it  would not matter which race or religion this child belongs to, they all will show a similar reaction, and express themselves similarly.

That\`s the natures **""inner toolkit**"" working providing hints to ""**right direction /Choices**"" 

You see that every human is in possession of this toolkit, though a lot of us choose to forget using these over the time under the societal conditioning.

Which is sadly driven by the selfish principles like ""acting in pure self interest"" and taking care of those who look like us or believed to be of our own kind""...

Then why do you assert my friend,  that onus of all the wrong in the world is on the **religion(s)** and ""**historical humans**"" who said some words, or asked people like you and me to follow  a certain path.

Why not try and apply all these gifts of chromosomes inbuilt in us, to evaluate & choose for ourselves. Running their discourse on the logic, historical and geographical evidences, experiences and other tools available. - Scientific discovery essentially.

As far as all the misery of the world is concerned, root cause of it everywhere would be the individuals selfishness, and ignoring the hints provided by this inner toolkit. *aka, that faded voice from heart*

We under the influence of **selfishness enticed by greed** , ignored these hints from our innate toolkit, for so long that sadly it has stopped coming anymore for most part...

So, now we are left on the mercy of **""Books""**, **"" scriptures""** and self proclaimed gurus... 

There was a time when there were no books or written scriptures, everyone was relying on the **hints provided by this innate toolkit..**

and then greed and selfishness flashed and some one, at some point, for the first time, must have dared to ignore the hints from inner toolkit and decided to chose otherwise.. That\`s how it begin!

Rest copied, the trend followed and it took us all here... those opposed were ignored or crushed! This is what modern history tells us.

That\`s how & (why must have )  written religious scriptures,  avatars, gurus,  happened on different point of this timeline of deliberate corruption  & suppression of **""inner hints""**

The scriptures and avatars are there to just to remind us humans that we possess a unique toolkit but we are forgetting to use it, and it is not good for us in the long term....

You see, all the religions on this planet in their depths have only pointed us humans to listen to  ""**this inner toolkit**"", where real knowledge happens.

Eventually, some day in the future, a majority of humans will find a way to pay attention to the hints coming from this inner toolkit. 

And all fake knowledge and religions creating illusion of different paths will collapse. As everyone would have the access to the truth and one end. 

In nutshell, all the religion in their current format are serving a purpose, which is to guide humans to somewhere, point them in some direction, and alluring them to walk a path of their choosing...

Apparently, those who were entrusted with the authority to continue poke and remind humans about this core stuff  got corrupted themselves /Stopped listing to their inner toolkit..Some got hijacked (influence of greed / Self interest ) 

In present format majority of these custodians of the original message are only disclosing what suits their interest.

Which is,  taking people to the different extended recursive paths while smartly hiding the essence.  Fitting their vested interests. 

And that\`s causing all the confusion & creating this massive illusion that end destination is also a different place at the end of every path. 

You would see...

yet, IMO, every individual  still has got some access left to this toolkit. We all agree that everyone who lived in the end has to die. All path must converge to one. As all rivers of the world become one water in the vast ocean. 

There are everyday experiences we chose to ignore. 

Those who would continue to ignore ""this hint from the inner toolkit""  will continue to be confused and disillusioned... 

 Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. 

Evil = Bad, and Right = Good  today are mere a label we put to our action based on its outcome. if they suit our interest, label it as good act, otherwise a bad one., isn\`t so!

Does any other animal labels any of their act as a good or a evil ? 

As evident from the above, all the labels of evil and good are inside us, this hint coming from ""**inner toolkit**""  had always picked up the right label without a fail. Or else majority of humans would have been murderers, thieves,  and humanity would not have made this far!

Point is, that nothing is that bad externally, we have chose to ignore the majority of these inner hints as they contradict with our modern definition of good and bad. (Selective / always in self interest ) 

Recent population explosion across the globe has added mostly this ""type(s) of human""  one heavily conditioned  with no support of this **""inner toolkit""** and hence all the chaos we see in the world, as no one has got a clue about what is right or wrong. It is pure selfishness and greed. 

It is us as individuals, who need a fix. 

Start with giving importance to the hints originating from **""Inner toolkit""** which is far more superior and work of millennium of evolution. Sir, so how many pills did you say you have left? Sir...? I believe in Buddhism, not for the myths and legends, but for what it teaches and for its values. Do you think I'm ""stupid"" for believing so? No body else gonna mention how he said fuck Buddhism? But then proceeds to say that all that matters is lovong life in the moment on this earth?? THATS WHAT BUDDHISM IS ABOUT! Making the life you live HERE on EARTH as powerful and meaningful as possible. Do research before you spew hate filled shit all over things you dont even understand. Yeah I still believe in a rebirth sorry Religion is control “Let go of these childish beliefs people, face the truth, that you are the one that controls your destiny.“

So free will? As it was written in the Bible.
And no one where in the Bible did it say we can’t advance as a species? 

And religion doesn’t divide us. It’s sin. Not being left, right, colored, poor, rich. It’s the sinful nature of mankind that fucks up the world. I don't believe in religion, but I respect it, a good person is judged on how you treat others imo, I don't need to believe in religion to accomplish that. Try to live your life as happy as possible, as a kid once said if you can't be happy due to a disability, there is thousands of other things that can make you happy. RIP Sam Berns. Your thoughts are no different from those believing in a certain religion and is much closer to those which believe every other one is wrong. Being here in the now is pretty much the basis of all religion. Chill. Agree. You are kind if summarizing the teachings of Buddhism. K Fuck Prayer rooms. 

Fuck Vaastu. 

Fuck Beef Brigade. Tell me how did the universe start Why are you so mad I don’t understand why you are so upset. You’re kind of doing the same thing as religions would do which is telling people to leave their belief and join yours. Chill Religion =\= spirituality. One can believe there is some higher power or energy without succumbing to an organized religion, and should not be judged or discriminated for doing so. Your first three paragraphs are just an angry version of the core teachings of Buddhism.

Not sure what Buddhists your familiar with, but impermanence and understanding your connection to the universe is literally the closest thing to enlightenment words can describe.

Just so you're aware. People will find a way to divide without religion and I say that as an atheist. If you destroyed religion it would be race, if you destroyed race it would be nationalism, if you destroyed nationalism it would be ethnicity, then language, and so and so forth.

Humans hate.  Religion didn't make us do that.  Hell, many religions are actively trying to get us to stop.

The Nazis didn't need religion to cause the holocaust, or Stalin the holodomor, or the Chinese the cultural revolution.

Humans are the key shitty factor here, not religion. Religion doesn't divide. It depends on who is using it for what ends. 

Don't forget that the largest mass murders were committed by atheists: Mao and Lenin.

Atheist governments can also manipulate humans to murder and hate others because of race, class, etc... Fuck i hope this coronavirus kills all the fucking oldies with their fortified faith in religion potentially bringing in better generation adults into play. Uhm ok? Yep. Couldn't have said it better myself

Cheers I hope I am not too late.

You sure it's just the religion?

God is dead by Nietzsche led to Nazism.

Fuck Nationalism https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=yq4uCWtQE24 lol just let people believe what they want But have you ever tried DMT? Be careful of making progress your religion No. There are SPECIFIC countries causing world unrest. 

&#x200B;

USA (Christian)

Russia (Christian)

China (Atheists) Does religion corrupt people or do people corrupt religion?

I think people will find an excuse to be ignorant and shitty regardless of religion. If it wasn’t Jesus or Allah it would just be something else.

Look at celebrities, famous youtubers, Trump, Bernie, Reddit, corporations, brands, computers, literally anything. People are willing to argue, preach, fight, and die for these with or without conventional organized “religion”.

Who’s to say anything and everything isn’t already some form of “religion”.

People created religion, not the other way around. Even if religion were to magically disappear today, I guarantee it would all start up again in a matter of days with essentially the same shit, just different names.

“Religion” isn’t the problem, it’s people. ?????...... Who hurt you? While I dont disagree with the issues you speak of with religion and who believe it in, I dont believe anyone knows for sure what happens after death. So you really shouldnt say what happens after you die, cause you know...you don't know either. I'd upvote for visibility but downvote for not realizing something simple. So no vote. Shouldnt this be on r/confessions I don’t believe in any god or have a religion but man, this post was just really edgy and kinda sad, just let people believe in stuff, as long as they aren’t hurting people Weird flex my atheist friend, people are gonna believe what they want to believe in. No ones certain where the soul/ conciseness goes when we die, so let us be creative, let us use some imagination. Is it really harming anyone, if it brings peace of mind to people of faith I don't want to sound ironic but, you do know that atheism is technically a religion right?  this sounds like of a closed minded person who's Seriously angry and can't keep it to himself. I resent atheists but I don't go around screaming it at the top of my lungs. 90% of adult life is learning how to bite your tongue and sit on your emotions, And this person sounds like he seriously failed at that. Reddit moment Religion is not perfect. People are not perfect.

>If religion, instead of being the manifestation of a  spiritual ideal, gives prominence to scriptures and external rites, then  does it disturb the peace more than anything else.”

– Rabindranath Tagore This ideology could be a religion in and of itself 0.0

The religion of non-religion. You have as much proof that God doesn't exist then a religious person has that he does. That means zero. You have the right to believe whatever you want, and the right to not believe in anything. But your way of thinking isn't superior to that of one who thinks God exists. This post is very condescending, narcissistic, and shows lack of open-mindedness rather than the intended open-mindedness. It's very little and shows lack of character and a superiority complex. You're not special, and neither are religious people. But what you are that most religious people are not, is disrespectful. I don't it's possible for our star to die in a supernova explosion. It's too small. NOW WHAT!? You and your ilk have a warped concept of what religion is and its purpose. Religion does not establish a nation, it establishes an individual. It is the foundational practice of philosophies that is keeping you alive and making this shit post. All your plights about the history's problems are a result of politics and the absence of religion. I predict your argument: ""look at all the nations and historical events predicated on religion"". Proceed to make that argument and make a fool of all yourselves. They way you spoke about religion was childish. I have to remind myself these are your beliefs or views that you are expressing here and good luck with that. Beautiful It’s crazy but Buddhists Christians Hindus and Jews all life in peace with one another. Didn't read lol

Are you one of those fedora-wearing neckbeards fighting fUnDiEs on the internet? Now that's a sad, pointless waste of time Grumpy bear just joined the chat. *CRAWLIIIIIING INNN  MY SKIIIIIN* Coming from a religious guy, I feel like I’d rather be believing in something that isn’t true and spend my life optimistic for the future with no fear of death than to believe this is it and I’m just destined to be lifeless dust floating in space and who I am will be irrelevant when I die. Just seems depressing to live like that imo. Euphoric I believe in the New Game + Did anyone else read this as Eminem from  the movie 8-Mile

Fuck a Papa Doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer,
fuck everybody
Fuck y'all if you doubt me
I'm a piece of fucking white trash, I say it proudly

And fuck this battle, I don't wanna win, I'm outty,

Here, tell these people something they don't know about me. This website claims to be so accepting and then a post makes the front of Reddit that is basically straight up shitting on a large some of people that don’t live how the poster wants them to.

Yeah, you fuck off. Fucking hypocrites. We get it dude but seriously... /cringe Not religions fault if followers are idiots to begin with! What is your aim with this post? Any argument that starts with telling people to fuck themselves is going to create nothing but hatred. That's not how you start a constructive conversation. Religion is a powerful thing created by geniuses among us use it wisely it can unit people of different cultures,Color,ideology etc but it can also can cause downfall of a civilisation . ok there goes reddit with its childish anti-religion atheistic boner. Seriously how many brains cell does one need to understand that its humans that are the fucking problem, that if there was no religion i guarantee we would FIND something else to muder each other over? Religion isn't a bad thing. Religion doesn't kill people. People kills people. Religion is just an excuse. Anyway, it's not possible to say if gods exist or not. Just because they don't interfere directly doesn't mean that they don't exist. I agree. But also, fuck India. What a terrible place Sorry I don't have any condoms I agree religion shouldn't be a thing, but you're pushing your own beliefs onto others, saying that what they believe in is dangerous and wrong so they should change to your way of thinking instead. Which is what most religions out there do right now. Just saying. so answer why and how we exist? for what reason People like this act as though religion is the root of all evil. Even religion didn't exist, we'd still fight and kill each other over race, sex, politics, sexuality, and money. 

But sure, act as though we'd be a perfect society if it weren't for one thing. Happy 14th birthday! I mean technically Buddhism is fine with atheism but go off. If it were not for various religions, people as a whole would have difficulty grasping concepts larger than their own life. If your life is being ruined by someone's interpretation of a religion, blame them, not the religion. Ok 😐 Ok I don’t know OP sounds a little closed minded to me. Not advocating for blind faith without critical analysis. Just saying, sometimes there’s valuable information in things we don’t agree with or that don’t sit comfortably with us. edgy I'm amused that this is labeled as politics.

No it fucking isn't. Religion is fiction. Ironic. If there is no God, why does anything you've said even matter? By who's definition is any of it wrong or evil? I’m not up for extremism or violence through religion, but the amount of nihilism resonating from this post is way too much. You can’t lump all the followers with the ones who want to bring about viol and suffering Relax... You seem like a big fan of Ash Wednesday yes sir im on it Nah people are just terrible you don’t need a religion to do that That’s a nice belief you have.. Yo lmfao Religion is not the only things that divides us. So many other things like the color of our skin, sexuality, politics etc. Insults are never the way to convert people. That’s fine we are living in a simulation, so maybe after we “die” on Earth we’ll go to simulated heaven and see all our loved ones. You anti-religion people need to move on to simulation and higher powers in the universe - not a religious god - a higher evolved power that makes us look like amoeba. I don't believe in any God but I respect the people who believe and have faith in supernatural powers. I know you want to say something good but you just sound like a toxic atheist that thinks that everyone who believe in higher powers are stupid. And religion in a lot of cases try to help people, christianism has some teachings, like helping the poor or to not judge others. I think that if people are happy thinking in a way no one should try to force their own beliefs into that person, you believe that there is no God, then be happy with it but don't try to shame others for their religions. Science has given us comfortability and quality of living. It has not given us happiness. 

Religion, the realization and renunciation of the transient nature of our physical enjoyments will give us happiness. 

It is no religion that takes from others, wants to change others, and hate others. There is no religion in blind faith. If it does not lead to love and charity it is not religion. 

There are many organizations across the world that are sincere. Get to know these religions, not the humans who have perverted them. For starters, many Sikhs are beautiful. And I'd love to see you test your atheistic mettle against the Swamis of the Order of Ramakrishna. Some people are religious because of the off chance there is a god, and the eternity in heaven is worth being religious for. If there is a god, I’d be willing to tell him straight up to his face with no guilt, how shit a job he’s doing and that he should be ashamed of himself ! I am of the opinion that religion is a means to control the masses Fuck all atheists who claim to know the answers to the universe. 

You are nothing more than claiming to be a secular prophet who “knows the truth of the universe”. Fuck outta here with your bullshit. Ah, Indian just like American, just pretending that the bad religious people you see on your street reflect all religious people worldwide, while it is just in specific countries where religious become violent. Imagine you are living in a world where no religious person ever had influence on your life and you have never ever seen any criminal or anti social act done by a religious person in the name of his religion. Guess what: I don't hate religion. You know who I hate? People who do wrong, no matter if they are religious or not.

I am atheist, but my mother is not, but she doesn't believe in any religious bullshit, she is just a normal person who is by herself sure that there is a god, but she never wanted anything from me cause of that or others. Every time I see those hate posts about religions, I think about my mother, and question why people would wanna hate her? She is the most loving and caring person I ever met in my life, and my friends and visitors i get all approve that, especially her food ;). Can you imagine how that feel if someone says what your mother does is bad, although it isn't? That is the key problem here, you are saying ALL religion, while you should be angry about the ACTIONS, hating religions means that you are not particular being angry about the ACTIONS that they have done to you, it means that you hate EVERYBODY of them, it means that you hate those WHO NEVER had harmed anybody, who never had imposed their religion on others.

You say to fuck a group of people where there are a majority who have never done anything wrong. And now those people can use that as argument against you, cause you are not particular pointing those things out that are missing in your country WHICH EXIST IN OTHER COUNTRIES, like CLEAR splitting of religion and government. You have practical no idea how life is in a country with splitting of religion and government, AND STILL, you want to hate _ALL RELIGION_, which means you are also hate those people here in Germany who follow a religion that never influenced their life or the life of others. This is despicable and actually helps those people who are really wrong, who abuse religion to get into power who abuse religion to stay in power, cause they just can point to the harmless people an d say ""Why you hate those?""

You are literally hating people for the actions of others, which is the same as racist do. You are like a racist cause you are not pointing to those who did wrong, you point to ALL and say they are all wrong, cause of the actions of other people. All this hate in the world is just disgusting. Be ashamed, inform yourself about the world, and start liking the good parts and pointing to the bad parts, and not point to parts which are used for good and bad in the world just because you are too stupid to open your eyes.

I also want to point out: Isn't it funny how you describe how people should be living together and reflect in those sentences the way religion is used in modern civilization, in those countries which split religion from government. It is kinda disturbing that you have no idea how the world rotates and believe everybody is living in a shithole where religious people take action in the society. Just disturbing and totally stupid to fire up broadsword against people you do not even know, you have no experience with, you just know those in your shithole, but want to condemn those in other countries without even knowing how they are doing in other countries.

I hope you get the hate you spread. Fuck you. It's like blaming on the gun and not the shooter. People (most of them) follow religions as a discipline. However, there are some those who create division and unrest. Best thing is to avoid them. How the fuk do you know pal ? I don’t think religion is the problem, it is humanity that is messed up. Getting mad at religion can be easy, but if you want to be more accurate the issue lies a mother step wider, namely our tribalistic tendencies and power struggles. It just so happens that religion is one form that had been more visible, but more recently blaming religion just sounds like going backwards into more tribalism which is the real issue. Intriguing!! In this entire barb, it is about ""you"" and ""your"". 
Bro, are you the next enlightened one, lookout for followers??
Anyhow, for the rest, this video should be helpful:

[Why religious beliefs are not silly?](https://youtu.be/pLj4iwa0__8) You dont know anything son! Let people believe what they want to believe. Atheism are for the weak, lazy and nihilism that wants to justify their depression, hatred for life, antinatalism and laziness on the fact that we don\`t matter, we are just matter and that nothing matters. It is the coward way to rationalize one's own failure. Wants proof? Atheists have the highest suicide rate than any religious group by far. Failing to coping with depression leads to atheism. It is short-sighted to be so sure in what happens beyond death. We know nothing of our consciousness and it's impossible to say what happens when we die. I am against all religions, but the way that you are so sure of something that science knows nothing about comes close to just another form of religion to me. Agnosticism might be a better way. *claps in american* Fuck India Try some dmt.

You'll eat your views on what you think ""the big picture"" is.

All in all, your view that there's nothing else out there, is just as arrogant and ""silly"" as all those organized religions put together.

It's comical, the irony... Fuckkkk religion they should all burn anyways. A very uninformed understanding of what religion is, although I agree with and empathize with all of your sentiments. Thank you for this! Couldn't agree more

The only reason I can think of for believing in religion is hope. (Old people and the fear of dying, drug addicts that need something to hold onto or people that have had a bad time) Religion is the main cause of unrest worldwide*

Fixed Man, your life truly sounds like it sucks. If someone believes in something and it gives them a better quality of life, then fuck you for saying they can’t. You suck. >Fuck Hindusim, fuck Islam, fuck Christian, fuck Buddhism.

Thank God I'm a Pagan I'm definitely not religious, but we should let people believe in what they want. Maybe the reason they hold on to their beliefs is because they are scared of dying or it makes them feel safe, cause fuck man death is scary. I know people say they aren't afraid of death, but I find that to be bullshit because I bet when you are sitting right in front of death then we will all be shitting our pants. 

I definitely don't agree with religious people who push their beliefs on us, but it doesn't mean I should tell them their beliefs are dumb because it's what comforts them. I mean who are we to take others comfort and safety away. 

Religion can be evil if used by the wrong people, but for many they only use it to do better. 

Also, if we are all insignificant in the grand scheme of things then why give a fuck about anything at all especially something like religion. Just let people live their lives and do your own thing. Hahaha, what a sad edge-lord. I’ll pray for you even though you’re one of those radical atheists who are as equally stupid as their radically religious counterparts.

Atheists are always full of themselves claiming an open mind and being woke, when really they are just as oblivious. You’re pathetic at the moment, but hopefully you will find some clarity soon.

You can learn from anything. It really isn’t a big deal. People mostly do it because of the chance that there is god. If there isn’t then oh well. r/copypasta What a bunch of terrible and hateful logic by a young teen, people are actually at their most evil without religion, recourse, or law. 150+ million dead to atheistic ideologies by Pol Pot, Stalin, and Mao. Edgy. Cool to know you hold all the answers of the universe. It’s ok to have faith. It’s ok to be afraid of death. It’s ok to congregate with your community. It’s ok to celebrate your culture. It’s religion and it’s rules and outdated beliefs that you do not need. Fuck Reditism Atheists are weak willed people and immoral people that thinks that just because the universe is big it means sentient life doesn't matter. Atheism is the first step to sociopathy and later to psychopathy. I am glad i saw the light and converted from atheism to christianity some time ago Religion, much like various cultures, are constructed based on the reigning norms and values of that society. However much like various cultures, they eventually obscelesse. I just hope the whole world one day will say this Calm down, my friend. Technically being atheist is also a religiou Breaking news as /r/India suddenly becomes /r/atheism from 10 years ago Yeah, I remember when I was 14 Lmao if I said that my parents they would whoop my ass, I somewhat do agree with you tho. I agree but also believe that money is a big contributor to what's holding back humanity. Because it creates greed. If we could just worked together as one people we could contribute so much more to the world and the future of humanity as a whole. You should join my cult. You know what I figured out? Gods are that imaginary friend you need support from when you're going through hard times. 
That's it. The whole thing is based around this Says the curry eater It’s been about a decade since I’ve become non-religious, but this type of stuff gets on my nerves. You explain how little value human life has and proceed to make the argument that religion has ended countless lives. I promise you, we are just as clueless, our actions just as arbitrary, and our minds are just as closed, if not more, than the most religious people on Earth. Sir this is a Wendy’s


(also what’s up with reddit and religion hating neck beards?) You can't force someone to leave their religion. I see a lot of anger in your post. You say God is not real. I understand where you're coming from. A lot of people use religion as justification or reasons for doing something or not doing something. The real answer is this: life is empty and meaningless. Does this mean God isn't in your life? Maybe. Religion doesn't start violence. Interpretation of religion does.

You say with full conviction that there is nothing after death.

Have you ever died before???

What you wrote is just your opinion not fact and a total bulshit.

Read Bible, Kuran, Gita. Hopefully, it will open your mind. [removed] There’s really nothing wrong with Buddhism, They don’t even believe in a god, it’s a nice religion( more of just a way of life tho), it doesn’t really belong in this category with the others lol On which premise we base morality? Why not suicide and bring it all with you? >Awww so badass
Abe Facebook pe post kar na dum hai toh lmao

.


>He got gold, silver and all that too
He's preaching to people who already do that

>That's like me telling you not follow modi
If he was discussing religion like we do then it would have been okay.


>But preaching to them ki ""fuck your religion""
Arey Reddit pe vaise he naastik baithe hain

Ye sab aap apne relatives se boliye na If you think the religionists have fucked up the most, wait till you read what the godless (read communists) have heaped on the world. At the end of the day, humans are bad for humanity. The conventional wisdom of bad vs good and evil vs good are blase. The politics of religion (or its absence) is the root cause of all these evils. Forget about religion, forget about spirituality, enjoy your moment under the sun as the only continuum, then you are safe from all fears and fearmongering. I would argue that religion is not what causes problems, stagnant civilizations, wars and murders. Bigotry is. People kill each other because of the unwillingness to accept that the other guy has just as much right to believe what they believe. Silence stagnates when people are unwilling to be open to new ideas. Cultures divide when we can't accept differences. Bigotry is not unique to religion. So I would argue, let's address the real enemy or else it will perpetuate even if all religions die off. Dude, you tell me to open your mind and ""come back to the real world"". Your real world sucks ass. It's a fallen world. This isn't the true world. It's apparent you need to open your mind. 

Also, isn't this an abuse of rule 3? This is literally hate mongering. WORD!!! Some people literally need religion because they have nothing else and wouldn't be able to cope with their reality otherwise. Well, you're going to be foaming out the mouth when you learn about Baha'i.

Not Indian, just saw this on r/popular, but: fuck you. Scapegoating is wrong. Very mature and elegant. wow you are so cool retard You make atheism sounds so twatish though. Not a coincidence that [most psychopaths are atheist](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2017/08/07/health/atheists-religion-study.amp.html) 

Keep your science fairy tale to yourself. Your weak theory (which is what it is, a theory) of the Big Bang is from a cult leader. But have yall ever tried DMT tho? Looks like somebody just finished reading Sapiens I was once an aethist, now agnostic. 
You cannot blame religion based on what people do. Want to know what Islam is? Read Quaran, want to know what Hindusim is? Read Vedas, Gita, and scriptures. Read Bible to know what Christianity preaches.
People are trash, they never go beyond their ignorance. 
Religion is not a set of rules, it's a lifestyle. Non religion preaches hate and bigotry. 
It's people who use religion as a weapon. 
As far as I have studied hinduism it goes way beyond life and death. From Ayurveda to astronomy from philosophy to physiology every aspect is covered regarding human life and death and beyond. We need to clear the fog. Religion is a set of rules and a moral compass to follow when you feel like you can't handle a situation alone. What you see on TV isnt religion. What you see people murder each other over isn't religion. It's sad and I hate it. Religion is something personal between you and the world we live in. You speak too much for a person who knows too little. /r/im14andthisisdeep Lol some kind of a fucking pathetic simp got mad when he lost a game of fortnite. Go fuck urself 14 yrs old kid I'm literally scrolling through Popular and came across this. Dafuq is going on in India? You can disagree but....damn dude, chill Fuck you. Cringe. Couldn't have said it better Imagine having.your wife burned because you.died before her Yea let people have their thing but leave me out of it.  I know but i don’t care. Fuck people who don't believe in a higher power. Amen! Hello from America, I feel the exact same way. Really no need to come at religion with you uninformed opinion because your insecure about yourself. Pledge your hearts to Satan my fellow heathens. If you think like that why even keep living? This post did not make me leave my religion. Islam teaches good manners, its brought me love and respect. Contentment without jealousy. Even if you don't believe in the afterlife (which you can't disprove either) the teachings alone are worth passing down. I think my favorite part is “nothing divides us expect religion” except ya know politics, cultures, personal beliefs on how to live, shall I go on this is a really poor argument on your part. Read The Law of One. ""Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing.""

How do you know that's what happens? The old “I don’t agree so fuck you argument”. Why does crap like this get so many likes? Edgy and soypilled Raised in the church, left the church tne slowly re read the bible after a bunch of philosophers (athiests) quoted certain bits.   


Certainly dont think its all great but many good tales and lessons in there with god excluded. & i would add suicide rates are much higher amongst athiest communities than not. You forgot to fuck judism. Edit ur post. Buddhism actually isnt a religion. Side note it’s been conferred by scientist many times that theirs a grand being responsible for our creation on top of thousands of other arguments that just completely invalidates you argument, better luck next time.  The only reason I can think of for believing in religion is hope. very reddit of you Ok mr athiest r/im14andthisisdeep I'm waiting for this to become a copypasta. Let me remind you that Zionism was founded by an atheist ((Theodor Herzl) and this same ideology uses religion in many context to justify its relevance! Spare us your BS and start advocating for atheism when atheists come up with something constructive, not an ideology that created the most twisted society and an apartheid entity! 

Your use of science to promote atheism is just but a trick to give your idea some credibility! It works with some but not with all! Let’s go Judaism >Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species.

WHITE POWER! My biggest problem with religion is how so many of them clearly push the message across that we are all equal/treat others how you wish to be treated. But the majority case is, we are all equal, unless you're a woman, non-hetrosexual, from a foreign country or believe in a different religion. Religion is the main cause for division in the world, Christians hating muslims, jews fighting islamics, and so much more. On top of this the catholic and Christian churchs(maybe others too?) have been massive door stops in the evolution of scientific research. I support the peace religion tries to express, but the methods are far too skewed. Fuck buddhism ?

For what ? I'm an occultist Wow very well written and I couldn’t have said it better myself! It makes me angry that I’m in my 20s and my mom still tries to force religion on me saying that I got the good job I have now because of god...no mother I got it because of ME because I worked hard and got it.  Stop giving god all the credit and understand I made it happen.  The way she talks about god and religion would shock you.  Its as if she’s convinced everything in the Bible is the truth and she even said no one’s going to convince her otherwise.  But it’s sad because she’s been abused by different people nearly her whole life, doesn’t like where she is now and that’s why she needs to hold on to religion.  She just wants somewhere to belong and to hold onto.  I just can’t wait until the day we all die and realize there’s nothing.  I wish I’d be able to see the look on her face. Imagine thinking you know anything The word religion. There are so many interpretations of that word. There is the Catholic religion, the Christian, the Protestant and the innumerable divisions of Protestantism, and there is Buddhism, Hinduism, Sikhs and so on. So many religions in the world, organised, some are brutal, the Islamic world and so on. So what do you consider is religion, the word? Is it the search for human beings something outside of their own daily life, something other than their petty self-centred activity, beyond their cruelty, bestiality and their vulgarity and all the rest of that? Is it that human beings have always sought from the most ancient of times something beyond themselves? If we consider that, something beyond themselves, beyond their daily life, then that becomes a religion of escape, which probably most religions are, as they are now. It is not connected with their daily existence. It is based on belief, on a book, or on faith, or on some dogma, rituals, the repetition of daily rituals which goes on practically all over the world - incense, dressing up, fancy dress and all that. All that, prayer included, is called leading a religious life, going, as they do in India at one time three times a day to the temple, and the Islamic world five times prayer, and the Sunday mass and so on. So this is considered religious, or rather a religious attitude. We are questioning that.

I would like rather to question the whole nature and the structure of present day religion. There are so many sects. They have found that Christianity is very limited, so they go off to Buddhism, or to some kind of sectarian gurus and so on, the multiplication of this search for something other than the daily boredom, daily loneliness, the constant conflict and so on. This has been the pattern. - Jiddu Krishnamurti 


https://jkrishnamurti.org/content/what-religion-you/Religion%20 Amen! God isn’t your imaginary friend, he’s your imaginary enemy.

An Imaginary Friend is a friend who will listen to your troubles, and are the only kind of friends I have. Oh, it wouldn't feel like r/popular if there wasn't at least one post bashing on religion. I’ve noticed most non religious or anti religious people I’ve met have one thing in common: they are not okay with the idea of having no control of their lives. They want to have full control and refuse to give that up. 

But we don’t... and that’s just how life is. God (or whoever/whatever you believe in) forbid you or I or anyone experiences the loss of someone and we really can’t do much to ABSOLUTELY avoid Or prevent it. 

We have to think more positively. You don’t have to believe, but you can at least respect the fact that others do. 

We can’t control what happens in life, but we are given full control of how to react to it. I wish I could upvote this 5000 times! Seems to me like you speak the language of your colonizers. Look deeper, think deeper. When did these problems begin? Don’t look for scapegoats. What messed you up isn’t religion, it is an agenda that was put in place before you ever graced this planet. Religion can bring good of it is used properly, look at Martin Luther King Junior or Malcolm X. Faith gave strength to people long before you, but you spout what your colonizers brainwashed you with. Wake up. Don’t think you are better than anyone else or that you have it all figured out. Atheism is also a religion, don’t delude yourself, because you read a few books or watched some TedTalks meant to influence people into leaving their creed and the only thing that comforts them. It is the settler/colonial system that makes us hate one another, because it’s easier to divide us to conquer us. k Like it or not, freedom of speech and freedom of thought is a double edged sword. I understand where your frustration stems from. I want to rid this country of divisive thoughts as much as you do. But we have to be better than them. We cannot speak in the same tone as they do. We have to stand up for our rights and rights of people that we don't agree with. That is the price of democracy. imo religion has always been a 'law' of sorts to govern the poor and uneducated back when it was established. 

I don't mind ppl who feel the need to find a belief or escape. it becomes a problem when it's an obsession, or wrong interpretation of the overall meanings or forcing an interpretation onto others. 

religion should not be more than 10% of your life. Ok mom Interesting... ""Fuck all religion. Fuck Hindusim, fuck Islam, fuck Christian, fuck Buddhism."" but you failed to mention Judaism... Seems like just an advertisement for another sub. Some of you guys make religion sound like the root of all evil, while terrible things have been done in the name of religion in the past there are plenty of good religious people who have helped society in a literally uncountable amount of ways lol the sun won't blow into a super nova. Religion was more powerful in the past. It's more about money now. Wealth is the divider these days. Humanism is it’s own religion. Buddhism is not a religion As if humans needed Religion to commit atrocity in the name of a ""cause""...for all your scientific theory you seem to understand very little about human nature.

Religion isn't the ""cause"" of anything it's a *tool* occasionally used by w/e ""powers"" as a convienent form of manipulation based in fear. Religion is factually nothing but a set of beliefs...general beliefs can and do exist outside of such constructions & would easily take it's place manifest in some other form.

I'm not religious but this seems (objectively) to be little more than an emotionally rooted kneejerk to pin the tail on a target for some personal pain. There is no god and I am his prophet right? In the name of religion a lot of people were killed agreed.

The epitome of scientific advancement contributed by the best scientists of the time, led to the invention of Nuclear weapons that killed a lot too.

So now are you going to say science is bad because people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki were killed? No, you would tell , science was used for the wrong purpose.

Same way, it's simple. When religion is used for wrong reasons, wrong things can happen.

Beautiful communities are formed through religion too, there is unity too.. it's not always fight between religions or for a religion.

My opinion is we should look at a bigger picture and be more considerate.

Have a good day. “Fuck Buddhism”

“You are here in the now. You are existing in this world where time passes and the universe is bigger than you could fathom”

[???](https://imgflip.com/memetemplate/46407983/Nick-Young) question, what drives your morality if you believe all will be dust in the end? Religion and it’s values, belief and fear in a higher power are what have brought society to where it is today. I’m non religious myself but you sound like an angsty teenager who thinks he’s found the solution to world peace. Spoiler alert, it’s not that simple and you’re not that smart or original for thinking it All religion will fuck you in return. People believe because idea of life being just this and that we are only one responsible for what we are doing scare the shit out of them. They rather believe in higher plan and some almighty overseer. I remember when I was 12. Weeb Wow so euphoric. Well to be fair buddhism isn't really a religion... It's really about just being more in tune with yourself and your community. It's more of a philosophy like taoism or confucianism. Edgy Fuck all religion. All hail economic ideologies 100% Cool story bro. So edgy. Religion isn’t bad *per se*. It’s been a thing since the primitive man was thinking. Modern religion is not the same as it was in the beginning; it was a way to ascend man to a cosmic level, to live forever, and many more things. Nowadays it’s just a vestige of that, stopping progress and shit. 
I would not call them “childish beliefs”, true religion is a beautiful and interesting thing as seen from a anthropological and psychological perspective. 

Religion as economics and imposition is another thing. >A little over 300,000 years ago we emerged as Modern Humans in Africa.

No. The fossil record has been updated more than once.

https://www.natureasia.com/en/nmiddleeast/article/10.1038/nmiddleeast.2018.15 Religion does suck. I don't believe in ""God"" but I don't hate on others for it. Live and let live type of thing. When it encroaches on my space I make it very clear that I would like no part of it. Mainly because nobody knows and therefore they are talking out of their ass. Hoes mad Let people believe what they want, if they’re not hurting anyone then why does it matter? This is exactly why I detest atheists. I don’t have a religion, I follow my own belief. But by far this absolutely harsh ideology is forcing your own beliefs just as others forced theirs on you. It makes you no better than them, and to be honest everyone needs to understand it’s not okay to force your beliefs on others.

That’s all that needed to be said, not this rant that slams and insults people that have done nothing to you. I can counter argue that those in some religions would likely have a less brute force approach and not be so callous and reckless with their words. Words hurt others, words start wars, words are like the bullets that provide ammo for evil and tyrannical agendas. 

Take a step back and realize you have no control, this shout into the void is useless. You’re doing it for comfort or recognition which is only temporary in the grand scheme of things. Applause fades, the curtains close, and you’re left standing there feeling good about yourself for the wrong reasons. 

The best way to detest religion is not to recognize them at all or give the energy you have up in an attempt to put them “on blast” so to speak. You don’t believe, good for you, many others are like you. But just because you don’t believe doesn’t mean others CAN’T believe. Stop trying to cause a stir in such a rude and disrespectful way out in the open and instead find a way to put that energy into something that will actually make a difference.


Have a great day. I think you got the date wrong about when we left Africa Good on you for you opinion. I'm no motherfucking devout religious sanyasi but hey atleast I don't write conceited posts shitting on other people's beliefs. Everyone's opinion is just as valid as yours. You're an atheist? Great. Good on you. Some people are Christians, some Hindus. Good on them too. Having different opinions doesn't make you superior to anyone. Fuck buddhism? I have always believed and always will that humans are meant to work together and the only legacy that matters is the one where you've ensured some kind of positive change for the future of our species. If nothing matters and we’re all going to die anyway who cares if some people are religious. shut up cracker You are free to believe or not believe in whatever you want, but this is such a boiled down to nothing take. You act like being a good Samaritan and advancing society is not possible while being religious, which is super dumb. You arent that smart for throwing out human history and the way u frame it makes you sound like a 13 year old white kid who doesnt have a lot to offer besides condescending snide comments; that and you come off as zelous and insane as the preachers and religious leaders of older times that ostracised and killed others for following their own practice( in your case lack of practice). Again you are free to put your time and faith in anything u want, religion or science, but you make non religious science praising athiests sound real dumb. Could use with a touch of less unnecessary nihilism and a ""nothing matters i a cog in the machine of the universe"" air to your ideas, cuz you are defintely not keeping an open mind. Based Live and let live. That is why we has this beautiful thing called freedom of religion in America. If someone's beliefs do not directly impact you, live at peace with them. Just as vehement as you are atheist, there are the same who are religious. You are not entitled to be right just because you are upset that people think differently. Grow up, and realize that people have the right to believe what they want, despite how upset it makes you. You are not preaching love, you are preaching hate of people who view the world differently. We are not all the same (genetics will tell you that). Religion is the real world, as it is ingrained within cultures throughout the world. People have believed in a creator for thousands of years. If it makes you feel better to be an atheist, more power to you. But do not tell me (or anyone else) how to live their lives, because in effect, you are doing EXACTLY that which you are criticizing. My 2 cents

I don't even know where to begin. Further more, I think that most don't realise the kind of argument you guys are putting forth.

I kinda understand where this thought begins but tbh it is just as good as any other scapegoat. We are so desperate to find a solution out of the misery and problems we are surrounded by that we make another scapegoat. The way in which responses are written in this thread shows the other bitter side of the coin.

From a completely neutral point of view, advocating for the removal of religion is as radical of an idea as some religion advocating for the banishment of the other religion (like what you see in the events unfolding). BUT wait... you could say, I as a non-religious ""unbiased person"" am seeking betterment for the society (I will overlook the way everyone on this thread places moral anchorage as if something like that even exists in this viewpoint - ""good and bad?"" What are those terms?), anyway, back to the point, you have done the same by placing yourself on a false pedestal dictating the terms and the way you present them as absolute.

So...

What is the true solution if you want to dismantle any , and I mean any false beliefs?
Simple - Engage in discussion and do not throw some belief out of the window or portray it as radical just because you don't like it. This way, we can have a society that actually progresses by engaging with the other and not by ""marginalising"" the other. Calling our groups to hate and laugh on the ideas of the other can also not lead to a harmonious society. Remember, you can come to similar terms on many issues by talking and listening to the other with an intent to understand

PEACE and I'm out Bruh for an ideology that doesn't belive in something they sure also hate it a lot. Nice opinion bruh. Don’t forget the most common modern religion to take over; Scientism. People think science will save humanity as much as a Omnipotent being will. You could easily replace the views of former generations of “don’t worry god will save us” with the modern view of “don’t worry science will save us”. Most people don’t realize the concepts are exactly the same. Also the same as UFO believers. “Don’t worry aliens will save us”. 

We’ve not grown spiritually at all in the last 1k years and I would argue we have digressed. You can see even you the op have your bias toward science in your post. Belief in science can be just as dangerous and honestly are exactly the same as belief in religion.

There’s nothing wrong with any of the views to be honest though. You don’t really hate religion, as they all serve a purpose. You hate peoples need to push their views on others and the childish behavior of always having to be right no matter the logic. Fuck that immature view instead! Well said. Show me on this teddy bear where the priest touched you Hey i hate religion and think it should be totally abolished. But you don’t know what happens when we die and it’s annoying when atheists say shit like “you know happens when we die, we just black out and that’s it”.

Yes we know what will happen to your body but no one knows what does it could happen when we die. It’s the one question we may or may never get answered. I'm not a believer myself, but shitting on someone else's belief is not cool man, not cool. You think you sound reasonable, but your tone mirrors that of an extremist in a religious sect. Sounds like a budding daoist to me. For all we have is reality, cast aside everything but reality. This is what I believe in!! I absolutely despise religious beliefs for the sole reason that in a country like India , in today's time, people go around wearing this tag of ' I am a ___' and ask others about their religious beliefs...and like in my family being atheist is like being arrogant like wtf?! My mom is a hardcore religious person and I am a hardcore atheist Bec of all the madness that goes around in the house under the name of this so called fucked up religion. 
I believe in Energy that thrives in the universe and of course KARMA ;-) Lol yo chill Fuck religion. Nice post Most religions that exist today (100s of them) don't even believe in the afterlife, so their point has nothing to do with death or immortality. Religions are made because the humans needed hope. The hope, that all of this has a meaning. They needed a guide how to behavior in life, to find peace in the death. But greed corrupted it, the humans themself did it, and if there is a god or more, humans wouldn‘t be able to life by their wills without corrupting it. Today, it‘s a tool to control the masses. But how do you know that you blackout and cease to exist after death? Calling all religion childish for what they believe of the afterlife and then imposing you know exactly what happens after death is arrogance. You're no better than the very thing you're complaining about.

Ultimately no one knows what happens after death and no one will ever be able to know until you die yourself. So what's wrong with hoping for something peaceful, especially when the entire concept of non existence is an unknown and scary thought to the vast majority. A good friend of mine who I care for has anxiety attacks from just thinking of this concept of unending blackness of nothingness. So what's wrong with finding peace in thinking of something different?

Personally I'm agnostic. Because theres no way to know, I dont think its logical to claim anything with certainty solely based off what anyone believes is true. But I dont think theres anything wrong with hoping for peace in the afterlife especially if it gives you peace of mind while you're alive.

Edit: After reading through the rest of your post I agree with mostly everything else, but i still dont think it's right to generalize religion like that. I agree the extreme side of religion is bad. There is a problem with anything when it turns into tribalism. Or when it makes people ignorant and unable to live in reality. But if people are keeping to themselves and helping others find peace in some way, then I see nothing wrong. Especially when there are a lot of good churches who help those in need with their personal problems, somewhat in the same way as therapy. Not only that but there are a lot of good messages that some churches preach, that dont necessarily even have anything to do with religion but are just simple messages of be a good person and love one another. Add caste to the list too.. That bullshit needed to be banished long ago... At this point it's more dangerous than a bad of heroin Post this on r/theydidthefuckyou What if I told you figuring out how to behave is way harder than knowing how from the start I am 31 and still recovering from the damage Christianity has done to me since I was a child.  One of the most unfortunate parts of religion is that it allows people to not take responsibility for the bad AND the good things that happen in life. It becomes a problem when you attribute all of your successful decisions in life as “the hand of god” because you never quite feel powerful enough to reach your fullest potential and happy self.   Like you couldn’t possibly have done well without help from some external force that’s smarter and braver than you.  They literally take children, break down their self esteem and make it so that the only people who can understand you are the other people in their loony bin called the church.  I once told my mother that using religion to raise your children is cowardly and lazy.  She didn’t take that very well.  
        When you get out of religion like I did, initially you are free and relieved. But then you struggle immensely dealing with reality.  No one ever taught you how to deal with your emotions properly and it takes a long time to appreciate living in doubt and uncertainty.  You spent all of your important developing years being brainwashed.   Religion is fucking evil.  It is for the weak and mentally ill.  Don’t let anyone tell you any differently. hey fuck you too As an atheist I agree with much of what you have written, though your grammar needs a bit of work. 
But many of your statements are inaccurate: just because some aspects of this life and death are unknown at this time does not mean we will not discover their underlying truths in the future.
However, your self-righteous attitude is not one that will succeed. Calling to religious believers' attention the myriad wrongs of religion will not convince them to seriously consider your argument.
And why should they?
Please think about this: most humans who have lived, or are now living, have an overriding goal in life to live as long and as happily as possible. 
So there you stand on a street corner waiting for the walk signal with an elderly person. When the two of you begin to cross the street, are you going to take away your fellow traveler's crutches and state they should not be used because you don't need them?
Though certainly far from perfect, religion helps millions of good people get along in this world. Who are we to deny them their peaceful and often kind and thoughtful way of living? 100 % agree. why do u guys send unwanted dick pics to everyone Copypasta Trump visits India.

Reddit: fUcK iNdIa AnD yOuR rElIgIoN! I use to believe exactly the same shit you do...use to...and now that I know the truth, I feel bad for you I don't believe in religion but everyone believes in something.
Some believe in money, some believe in science and some in religion.
The issue is not in believing something but imposing your beliefs on others. The expectation that everyone around you should believe in the same thing is what's causing the unrest in India. AND FUCK ATHEISM. Just live and let live. Wow! You have it all figured out. You should write about your wisdom, share it and gather followers. Temper temper. Religion or not, man is evil, does evil. Sure, people are good and do good too but left unchecked, without the God(s), Man will revert to bestiality. The common law and government only work when everybody buys into it.  Which is why we need schools, to ensure everybody buys into it from an early age.

Otherwise the idea that one can own property is meaningless fiction. But we strive toward that fiction and it is the basis for our society. More property, more status, more wealth, more police to safeguard it, more military to ensure outsiders don't claim it, and more religion to propagate the myth that God wants this.

But whether there is a God or not, whether it cares or not, is up for debate. What is not is that people left unchecked will always result in them exploiting others in whatever form s/he can for their own benefit. God, as we commonly imagine, possibly is an Alien. Wow.  Breakin new ground there..... Ok streetshitter Cringe atheist Gonna cut yourself on all that edge u/koalakitty84 Ok I don’t believe in religion. But I believe there were civilization on our planet about 12-15k years ago. We were advanced enough to build pyramids and many other megalithic things. 

We were a global civilization, but some natural disaster happened. 90% of the population got wiped out. We started from ground zero being cave man again. All the amazing technology became stories, and stores became legends and some became religions today The first perpetrator of religion has blood of millions soaked in his hands. Dude. I say this shit all the time. It’s all made up bullshit. Except I don’t get a thousand rewards for it. > Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing.


My only serious question for you is this:

How do you know? Preach man I strongly disagree, but respect your right to hold that opinion; and see no reason why we couldn’t get along. 

See? We’re not so bad :p 100% agree edgy teenager alert H.P. Lovecraft's entire horror is based on the idea that human existence is insignificant. Why do atheists love to trot this idea out like its a good thing? Not sure if religion is bad in its entirety.But, what I'm sure about is that it's being misused for gains. That's the real issue. Education might be one of the potent solutions. Christian here, I have a couple of questions.

Why does religion mean close minded?

Why does religion mean evil?

You say that after we die nothing happens. Have you experienced death before to back up your claim? Just because a religion is responsible for a war doesn't mean all religious people deserve to be hated. How can you be so sure there is no afterlife when you haven't experienced death yourself?

Don't get me wrong, I believe the same as you, but you can't just say you're right just because you think it is the most logical answer. All I see when I read this is arrogance and nonacceptance of a societal norm that isn't going to go away if you insult it. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá  said :

“If religion becomes a cause of dislike, hatred and division, it were better to be without it, and to withdraw from such a religion would be a truly religious act”. Angry Redditor is angry at religion. Then again what do you know? Fuck nationalism! This dude would be in nazi germany and say fuck you to the jews Damn, I'm an Atheist but let people believe in what they want bro. Sounds like OP read the book 'Sapiens' You couldn’t be more right. I agree but Buddhism shouldn’t be grouped with any of those. Especially Abraham if religions. Buddhism is more of a mindset than a religion. I trust in God. Still. Hey, if you are feeling this way reach out to like minded people. You'll feel just slightly better I promise. > [DISCOVER YOUR TRUE IDENTITY](https://youtu.be/Rf3HR6bAd4Y)

[Be like 🦋](https://youtu.be/crPfz52a32c), [fly with both wings](https://youtu.be/7zY9A28YmFE). People should be able to believe what they want. Insulting one’s religion could be in equivalence to insulting one’s political opinion. Some people pursue religion to seek a purpose in life. Others interpret their religion’s scriptures wrong and it stains the reputation of these religions. Preach Buddhism doesn’t really have a concept of life after death, at least not at its core. I have this exact same mind set, I fucking detest religion it has been the source of most wars, murders, rapes and tortures. It has been the source of corruption and inequality I mean “Divine Right of Kings” anybody?

It’s still a fucking source of those things now! 

I let people do what they want, because realistically I can’t stop people doing what they want. But it’s sad that some people are utterly brainwashed and pressured by families and communities and it’s awful seeing the way religion dictates how you should live your life. 

There is no ultimate goal in this universe, no watchful god to tell us our destiny it’s just ramblings in books. We have no purpose, we have to make our own purpose in life for what little time we have and I think religion greatly hinders that. Another reason reason why I hate it. It's not religion, it's ideas. Communism and other political idealogies are responsible for more deaths than religion. No matter what people believe about the afterlife and the divine, they will always find a reason to kill each other Ugh, rubbish post I fucked Religion before a year and I am happy now George said it best.

https://youtu.be/8r-e2NDSTuE Who hurt you? You know you can not believe in the organization of any religion but still be a moral & ethical person as an individual... right? 

You can inspire others to do right on a spiritual level by setting a good example. Leader or show others what you think/believe is the best way to live life and exist. 

However, what business is it of yours if others use their own spirituality or religion to give themselves hope or to have faith... a motivation or purpose for their own existence.  

Spirituality & Faith regardless of a specific religion can, in certain individual cases, be a lifestyle someone of their own free will chooses to just get by and live as best they can.  

Why leave any faith and ""come back to the real world"" if someone's faith and spirituality is their own personal motivation for being a good person, and just being good in general. 

In my personal point of view maybe you should calm down and think about what you wrote down. We are not all the same and we all can be divided by anything not just religion. Are you going to use someone's religion as a way to scapegoat and discriminate against someone as an individual just because of their religion? 

Learning and Science is important and crucial to humanity as a whole but so are moral, ethics, and basic human decency... how can this be learned if not by example. Judge someone as an individual by getting to know them & not just making blanket assumptions based on something so superficial as what religion an individual chooses to believe in. 

Maybe open your own mind and try considering life from another perspective. What if peoples' rights to believe & worship as they choose is taken away for absolutely everyone one day... and science and logic are the only options. In World War 2 the Nazis did this. Now, I.S.S.L  is also trying this as well. 

Do the phrases ""Never Again"" and ""Those who don't learn from the mistakes of history are bound to repeat those same mistakes"" are either ones you've heard before? This is not helpful. The zeal of atheism adds, in the eyes of the religious, yet another religious perspective...namely that there is no religion. 

Yes, world conflict can be caused by religion. But banishing it all together isn't going to solve anything.

In the secularized West, politics took the place of religion and we can see the effects of that in America. 

Religion or not, there will always be human conflict. It is the nature of our condition. Might I suggest sir. Why I am an atheist by Bhagat Singh. I'm guessing you dont like the pope huh? Religions are cults with a lot of money Nah it's not religion that causes problems, it's people's fucked up agendas and desires that get in the way Man, what did Buddhism do to deserve its spot on your shit list? the problem is people people will always be shitty in an area you find them in Lord Almighty, as I pray today for those that do not know Jesus I ask that You can break whatever it is that has control over their heart that takes them away from knowing You. Psalm 119:67 says, “Before I was afflicted I went astray, but now I obey your word.” It is true that many have to fall to their lowest points in life before they turn their life over to You. It often takes painful circumstances to drive us to Christ. Addiction, lust, materialism, and other deadly sins are false gods that are stealing the hearts of those who need You the most. I pray for those who are unsaved that You will be able to rip the bondage of what is holding them back. May they seek You! Amen. As people do we not also have the same right to believe in whatever we want, I am an atheist but I have nothing against religion only what most people believe religion entails... being religious does not mean that you have to go to church or spread your religion it is simply to have faith in something, this something does not have to be a god, it can also be an ideal. You should  be less concerned with believing religion is crap and more concerned with what *you* believe in, what *you* put you’re faith in. There is no need to separate yourself by what or who you are, what makes us who we are is our beliefs. do not separate yourself from everyone else because of this, that is what is wrong with the idea of religion in its current state. That does not mean, however, that believing in something is inconsequential, it could never be more the opposite. Amen to that. Reddit moment To believe in any religion in any capacity you have to actually be stupid. If there’s an afterlife we are in a simulation I believe its misinterpretation of religion/ religious texts, false beliefs and narrow mindset of people that causes unrest, rather than religion. 
The broad teachings of most religions uplift the moral values and teach people to live a peaceful life. Fuck you for flipping off my religion! Do you feel better now that you're done having a humiliating temper tantrum? My personal opinion: It is not a religion's fault that there is unrest in many religious countries. It is the fault of the people. They take extreme measures and start making up new rules that serve their goals in the name of the religion. A religion's purpose is to guide people through life and to it easier, but corrupted people have changed that concept. Thus, people will start hating their religion because its idea has been deformed. Nice Reddit moment Wow you’re so enlightened! And edgy too! Preach man You're beating a dead horse here dude. This should be on r/notliketheothergirls Yep yep yep Quit shitting in the streets. AMEN! Agree with the first paragraph, religion is retarded. But it's very possible there is an afterlife. Fuck all of India What drives people to act like this? We understand, you think sky man is bad, but you don’t have to be a complete asshole religion was meant to be proxy for law and order - however a lot of people were too soft in the head to make up their own minds about right and wrong and stuck to the teats of drug-addled story tellers. Then we gave these idiots the right to vote and the invitation to fuck up everything we worked so hard to create-medical aids,education, law and order. I don't think blaming the majority party playing on religious lines is of any use. These hate-filled people are our neighbors,colleagues and acquaintances and currently are ravishing every moment of delhi burning-it warms their heart . If you want to be of any use, remember till the very end who these people are and why they don't deserve an inch of space next to a human. See the contrast. Earth's most intelligent species- Humans creating all sorts of crazy stuff with science.
Also, humans believing their god created everything with some superpowers and that god can punish you and end your problems. Fuck you all, you stupid shits! Believe what you want but don't kill people if they disagree with you and don't brainwash people to join your beliefs. I agree with the reactionary sentiment but religion wasn't another hocus pocus idea coined out of nowhere by a selected group of evil people. Religion and God as a concept grew organically as we evolved, and anything that grows out of human nature and necessity isn't something to be discarded without second thought. Of course any high school student with a functioning brain can tell that most religious concepts are fictional and outright bullshit. But because something is not real doesn't make it invalid and irrelevant. Human nature like that of any animal on earth is filled with hate, violence and raw evil as abundantly as the good side of humanity. We are capable of things far far worse than what we are led to believe in this overly protected and privileged life that we lead. Without any rules for morality or shackling our need to present our shadow to the world, we would have destroyed ourselves long ago. Religion just happened to be the best model we have for working at this. Even as of now we haven't found any sustainable alternatives and most literature, from Jung to modern day psychologists, agrees with this. Yes it sucks that people believe in fairy tales and kill each other to defend their stories, but for now our civilization isn't grown enough to handle no religion on a global scale. As an atheist it makes me extremely sad but that's the way things are. As for the bright side of things, some stuff off top of my head. For now we can try distancing state and religion as much as we can, and elect law makers who support making policies for this cause. We can also try bettering our education system to develop empathy in children as they grow up. May be for starters not elect someone who's entire agenda was divisional politics from the beginning. We can work on initiatives in raising awareness and communal harmony. List goes on. > Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova.
You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter. But matter itself is being part of this universe.
But, you are here in the now

Thats probably one of the best descriptions of BUDDHISM I've ever read :D Has anyone sat back and thought.
""Hey maybe because of the fact I'm so incredibly small in this vast infinite universe, maybe just maybe I have no fucking clue of the forces that exist beyond us and the grand scheme of things. People just because your a spec of sand in this universe doesn't mean you don't matter. It just means you can't possibly hope to grasp the gravity of events that are going on at least in this lifetime And with that fuck capitalism and the state too! Bravo. Couldn’t have said it better myself. I cannot fathom how people believe in religion or a god. I really hopes this opens more people eyes. Funny how you sound exactly like a crazy religious zealot but with the opposite message Thank God I’m atheist!! Amen :( Atheism is a Religion. It's ok. It's the time of shadows now. No need to shout it from the rooftops. yikes🟩 I'm praying for you, OP. It's said that those with a seared conscious will never fully understand the concept of God the same way others with a strong faith can. The Holy Spirit is within you, OP. You just have to keep searching and the answers will be revealed. But you dont know what happens after death so ur just saying ur rather agressive opinion No gods, no masters. What about sikhi Personally, I've come to hypothesize that religion was born to quench man's greed to take control over others and their wealth by invoking the fear of the *unknown*. In fact, the concept of a ""God"" itself seems to be a rather genius invention which allowed someone in the very early days to control other people and to set them do their deeds—a few good and *mostly* to crush their opposition. At some point soon after, more people wanted this power over the populace and started their own groups with their own gods and thus, religions were born.

It's my personal belief that one can unlock their true potentials by freeing themselves of the ridicules imposed by their religions and gods and work for the greater good of humanity. But I would also be at peace with people following their beliefs if it didn't lead to abhorrent violence like the one we're witnessing right now.

We don't stand to gain anything by repeating the mistakes of our ancestors and murdering each other. We only stand to gain by working towards the future collectively. Religion is a necessary part of humanity. It is something that brings out the best in some people, and the worst in others, but religion gives people purpose and meaning because it is hard to understand that one day you will just black out of existance. Atheist until the plane crashes Rick Sanchez is tired of your bullshit guys. Pakistani atheist here and WHOLE HEARTEDLY FUCKING AGREE I mostly agree with you. But the tone I am reading is making it sound like a religion lol. 
Fuck religion. But I don't think we should believe on humanity either. We all are stupid and one day we will all die because of our idiocy. Agreed. And we have alcoholics because of jesus/church. (Church made it ok to drink /get drunk). What baffles me is that we still have churches. That people still believe this BS.  How many versions of the bible are there.  How drunk was the guy writing it. The last people on earth to become atheist will be Jews.

Which is why they promote it to everyone else You have quite alot of time to write this popular opinion. Well, that's your belief. Praise jesus Religion was legit just invented by someone who wanted control How is something this close minded so highly upvoted? Yikes I believe that every person can believe what they want, just don't be forcing your views on others. That also goes the other way. don't like religion, no need to announce it, you're opinion isn't an airline flight. Dick. RELIGION POISONS EVERYTHING!!! 🤨 Tbh anybody that thinks they're so certain about what happens after death is just as naive as everyone else claiming they understand this shit. There is literally no proof for either side that there is something or that there is nothing after death, it's all man made speculation. Being a hardcore atheist is no different than being devout to any other faith because you're claiming to know and understand something you very much dont. Until we die, none of us are going to grasp death in a true sense, and any living person that thinks they ""know"" is just as arrogant as the next, regardless of what they claim is out there. Accept that none of us know a fucking thing about death other than the physical process and move on You are almost there... I still choose to follow my religion, but I respect your opinion. To me it's just so empty to live for nothing in the future... to have the present unfulfilling reality and after that, nothing. 

I fully believe in Christianity... But even for those who don't, isn't there something to be said for having hope in something? Especially for all those people who have nothing to live for? Religion gives us value. 

In Christianity specifically, we believe in a God who cares deeply for us and has given us a future after death. Our lives mean something and we have a purpose now, and that carries on after death. To just get rid of that would leave life so empty. 

Sure, we can spend our time making our lives better. Helping others, bettering our lives and the lives of our families. But if that's it, what's the point? 
It just seems like a shallow, empty way to live... I'm not religious, but I wish I was. I understand why people are religious, it gives purpose to their lives, and I have none. Still some people try to play No True Scotsman, but seriously, that changes absolutely nothing. If it's prone to get violent and has gotten violent multiple times then that also *is*  a potential part of its ""nature"". Better reduce it's radius to just personal preferences. 

And I don't understand why they see you as moral-less degenerate like a dark moist mossy corner untouched by light if they hear you're an atheist. Like, wth is even moral? If you need a book, teachings, blind belief, and a supposed sky daddy just to be nice to others (which you absolutely don't either and rather find a way to justify your wrongdoings) then I can claim myself to be more self dependant than you ever will be. Man should be owned by his own thinking, not enslaved by what he's made entitled to believe. End of story. This nigga really out here believing the only uncreated creation is humans and space dust and nothing came before them. Problem are the ""Hindu atheists"" who are liberal but conflicted and play both sides. They indirectly enable these fascists. 

And Hinduism==Hindutva. Religion did not come first, Politics did. Ganesha was a satanic deity in the purana but his followers gained political power and made him benevolent. Whoever wrote Puranas obviously hated those followers and made their god satanic. It was only the pan-Indian empires who needed secularism(smhartists) who wrote differently but most kingdoms were monotheistic(Shiavist, Vaishnavist etc.), as far apart as Sunni and Shia. Nothing like what it is today.

Think about it, who would name their son Duryodhan(originally Suryodan). That's like naming someone Alakshmi. Whichever dynasty Mahabharat is based on obviously demonised them. Victors have been making the ""truth"" forever. Hinduism is not a religion. It's a way of living. I agree on the bit about religion but you couldn’t be more wrong when it comes to the history of mankind and you shouldn’t portray like you do. I just read all that thinking the person typing it was in rage, screaming with a red face. Which he/she probably was lol TLDR 🥱 What an angry little child. I mean... you could just believe and follow a religion and not be a radical... The super atheist Bullshit, I just saw God on Supernatural yesterday.  Likes to be called Chuck. Well said! Brother!!!! very classy reddit Fuck you too lmao. Nobody gives a shit for your nihilism. Also is you think religion is inherently evil you're an idiot PREACH! stop crying 🤡 Belief is good when it's pure. It's bad now because violence apologists use religion as their sword. Religion bad please upvote I see your point but you are one angry person. Relax and let people live. People will come around on their own terms if they so choose. So little words, so many lies It’s funny how ignorant some people are Propaghandi Wow you couldn't be farther from the truth. Christianity has all those answers yet you choose not to consider them because of your lusts (this is not just referring to sexual lusts.) Take some time to actually study Christianity. I know you won't because you don't want there to be a God that can judge you. You want to do what you want thinking that will improve your life. If you only knew and saw the actual movement of God now a days you'd be surprised and then afraid of your eternal pathway you'll be on after death. Agzina saglik kardes It’s a scam to get you to waste your very real time on this earth for a promise of more time that doesn’t come. Just enjoy the time you have here and now, it’s finite. AGREE 100% “You do not matter... but matter itself is being part of this universe.”

That’s an oxymoron. You just said it. Under your worldview, we do not matter. In fact, under your worldview you can not tell me why murder is wrong, rape, etc. Because we are cells together to form consciousness. 

Your worldview is incoherent. Your worldview leads to nihilism and death. Your worldview is the childish one, sounding Incredibly arrogant and edgy. Your worldview is incompatible with reason itself. You cannot even use rationale without borrowing from the religious, because the laws of logic themselves are immaterial.

Grow up, learn that the world isn’t black and white and that every human is capable of great evil and is indeed evil, whether religious or atheist. Stop blaming others (religion) for your problems. Man up. Try to do good. And stop following a contradictory worldview that says life has purpose because it has no purpose. Euh atheist movements caused massive exterminations, think Stalin, Lenin, Hitler, wtf this is so stupid. What if I chose to believe in what I want. You chose to believe in or have a lack of belief in what you want. We respect each other’s decision and move on? I think the problem in India is not your religion. It's india Speaking of childish, this rant.  Are you 14 and this is deep?  Religion is the reason we know how to read, how do you know what happens after death?  Have you died?  The catholic church has massive amounts of hospitals and medical care.  So you believe that nothing became something for no reason?  How can you say what is good and evil?  Isnt is all relative if there is no transcendent truth?  Faith in a God of truth and lawfulness is the source of science.  This post seems like the temper tantrum of a small child. I mean, you kind of just explained Buddhism honestly I think religion does have its purposes. It’s gives people hope, teaches good morals, and attempts to scare those people into following those morals. Most of those morals are good, but it also backfires with a lot of hate like you said. Such as Christians and their hatred for lgbt etc. Those words are exactly what I think of humans and religion. each and every word! Oh look another atheist that just has to tell people he’s an atheist. You guys do more spreading your word than all religions combined. Fuckin’ amen!!! Dude chill.... Lol. sorry but low IQ people need some kind of behavioral philosophy to follow or they'll all rage against their existence. I am not particularly religious. I enjoy some of the stories and agree religion causes a lot of damage but it can be helpful to some e.g the lonley. Being part of a community is good. It sounds a bit like you think war etc would end if religion did but I dont think it wouldb there would still be greed etc. You dont really know what happens after death so you can't really expect people to accept your beliefs over thiers. This came out of nowhere Your post indicates that you don’t have a true understanding of Buddhism, and because of that I have to believe that you most likely have a misunderstanding of all religions. To me it seems like your post is one led by emotion rather than of fact. So with all this open mindedness and being insignificant. Why would leaving religion  behind matter? Seems like you put a lot of effort into what is ultimately meaningless.

Also, the 20th century when God was proclaimed dead has been the bloodiest century more so than the past 19 combined. Thanks for that.

You say religion divides. And well I don't disagree with that. The major factors for war have always been greed, power and lust. 

Shalom shalom. God bless. Seems strange to not believe in religion but to be certain that nothing happens after you die.

I understand the absolute disbelief of man made religions but it seems just as arrogant to say that you are certain nothing happens after death as it does to say X or Y god is real. Don’t forget Judaism Fuck all atheism

Atheism is stupid and fucking useless. This is because I say so. Leave your atheistic beliefs. The Chinese are atheist and kill millions, you are a murderer as well.


- sounds pretty fucking retarded when you think with your brain Has this person not heard of communism. That alone has caused just about 100 million deaths in less than 100 years. Thank Stalin and mao for that. Very anti religious people. Before religion there was the ""eye for an eye"" and even before that, if you harmed someone, they were entitled to murder your entire family. Religion shows one way to deal with human urges instead of pouring them into the world. Wa wa cry Jeez, what's worse? A religious figure shoving scriptures down an atheist's throat or an athiest griping at a religious figure about the religion they worship? Why cant people just let others believe/not believe what they want? This post is honestly pretty toxic, I dont know why people cant just do what they want as long as it doesn't harm others Go back to tumblr No doubt religion has been used for violent wars and mass control of the masses but that doesn’t mean religion is inherently evil, only that people have manipulated it for their own selfish ends. TEEHEE at leaST YOU LoVe ThE jEWs. OP said Fuck Islam. Good bye OP. It was nice to read your last post. no On this same topic how about religions that don’t have a defining deity? I have quite a few buddhist friends and Wiccan friends who sure, “believe in fairy tales” according to me and a lot of other people around me, but they are some of the nicest folks I know and none of them pledge to any gods, sure Buddha is a figure head, but I haven’t my found a single person who worships Buddha, only the occasional person who follows the path of the Buddha, and only one of the wiccans I know actually “worships” the moon, the other two just hold a hefty respect for nature. What are some opinions on that line of thought?

Not trying to say these religions haven’t caused violence because any belief, hell fuck that, any difference that any human has ever had with another human has caused bloodshed at some point, but I have always found these religions more interesting to talk about then typical “I give my life and soul to god” religions. Full disclosure: I'm currently a Christian, but I have serious doubts about my faith. I appreciate the skepticism of your post, but there are some things I disagree with.

>You know what I think about your religions? I think it is a waste of time, I think it is just another fairytale for childish adults who cant grasp the concept of death. They all want to just believe in something good after death. Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing. Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova.

So what? Even if people are only religious because they're scared of death, this wouldn't make religion false. 

>Let go of these childish beliefs people, face the truth, that you are the one that controls your destiny. Believe in the humanity of people, have faith on people. We are all part of this speck of dust, flying through the universe. What determines our immortality is not what you did for your religion, but what you did for the future of this little speck of dust flying through the universe. Your legacy should and always be the betterment of mankind.

Why do you support ""faith in people"", but not religious faith? Isn't faith the very thing you are trying to eradicate? If you're against believing things without evidence, then both kinds of faith should be wrong. Also, your claim that we control our destiny seems incompatible with materialism(I assume you don't believe in souls), as then we would be subject to physical laws.

>Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion. As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed. Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. Fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.

I disagree with your second sentence there. Many of the great scientists of the past were religious. George Lemaitre, who developed the Big Bang theory, was a Catholic priest. The monk Gregor Mendel's work on heredity is crucial for our modern understanding of evolution. Those are just two examples. However, I'll be the first to admit that religion and science haven't always been harmonious, but I don't think they're entirely incompatible either. 

Additionally, why do you think ""nothing divides us except religion""? Unless you're defining religion super broadly, I'm unconvinced of this. In my experience, politics is just as, if not more, divisive. Also, religion can unite people by giving them a common purpose and meaning.

I sincerely don't mean to downplay the religious violence going on in India. It is absolutely terrible and there is no justifying it. However, I would challenge the idea that religion itself is entirely to blame. If religion were to be wiped off the earth tomorrow, I doubt that evil people would go away, and the regimes of Stalin and Pol Pot are evidence of this. The real problem, in my view, is ideological extremism and the gullibility of people to go along with it. These problems can occur whether religion exists or not.

One final point: Throughout your post you say that humans have an obligation to make the world better. My question is: What is the evidence that this obligation exists, and why should anyone follow it? I'm not a moral relativist, but I have been struggling lately with justifying my own belief in objective moral values. 👀 Damn who hurt you bro I know no one will read it, but anyway.
Author, you are super childish and maximalist. I had same ideas about religion when I was 18, but now I actually understand, how stupid I was back then. Yes, blind faith and all the violence, to which some religions and some people, acting religious, lead, is a bad part.
But religion also helps people to cope, for example with a loss of loved ones. Religion helps people to unite together in a community and help each other. Religion is set to promote kindness and prevent violence. Religion helps to achieve an inner peace and solve an existential crisis for some people.
Religion (and discussing particular ones) is a hard topic but your outlook on it, as I already said, is absolutely childish and wrong, only looking at one part of it. This is the most reddit post ive seen in months Agree Hey man I’m atheist as well but you really are mad, (I didn’t read through the whole thing so if there is a personal reason sry) OP is a pompous douche bag. >Fuck all religion. Fuck Hindusim, fuck Islam, fuck Christian, fuck Buddhism. Fuck you all for believing in this made up bullshit called Religion.

Prove its made up. Im not defending religion, but you do not know either way, or apparently have the ability to critically think. What was the point of this anyways? Looking for validation? Someone piss you off? 

You'll get over it. After taking enough fungi and such, religion is trying to describe an essence that it can't be spoken about really, and it isn't a power held above you as Christianity may describe a god as. What it tries to describe is really just the whole picture and each living thing from a microbe to a giant whale is apart of this whole. There is benefit to spiritualism I think, and for each person that path can be different or even non existent. It's just always better, I find, to keep it to yourself and not involve other people. Science has proved that there has to be a creator. You seem to have a lot of hate built up inside you. Stay positive. By saying fuck all religion you are just spreading hate as an atheist. War is inevitable with or without religion. [George Carlin’s take on this](https://youtu.be/8r-e2NDSTuE) This is the best post I have ever read!  Finally a sensible person speaking sensibly. Agreed in every way! Religion ruins us. Can someone explain? Sorry I’m out of the loop a few of your arguments do make sense at a microscopic level..but look

let people do whatever the fuck they want to do

however if you still insist on digging your nose in these matters, god as a concept rather than a rightful entity could be encouraged instead of going all the way and proposing atheism

also, religion to some is a source of reason/purpose so don't tread on it I would rather choose to believe and in the end be wrong, than live a life believing in nothing and in the end be right.  You are entitled to your opinion, just as anyone else, and I completely support that. But for you to say that what we believe in is ""wrong"" when you have absolutely no proof that there is no higher power, is the same as me saying that you are wrong because there is a higher power. There is no proof either way, that's why they call it faith.  I have friends of all walks of life, hindu, christian, muslim, atheist, and so-forth. None are wrong and none are right. Atheist governments commit mass killings as well. [Here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_killings_under_communist_regimes)  genocide isn’t exclusive to religion, in fact countless people throughout history (and modern day) have been and continue to be killed for simply having a religion. [cheers](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=O35Dxb_V2Sc) Maybe if you had some religion you wouldn’t be such an angry bitter person with a potty mouth. Religion is just a tool used by the powerful to stay in power. If it wasn't for religion, it would be immigration, social status, education literally anything.

The problem isn't religion. The problem is the us vs them mentality. Religion is just the means to end. I am always surprised at the Indians inability to work together. Ethnically you are the same. THe english came raped your nation and your people. They left you divided because the wanted to return as your masters. That did not happen, but The west is till your master. You all bleed the same. You are all Indian. Become the power you are meant to be abandon religion and bath in the blood of people like modhi who would promote it. join $DCLT! When you have nothing, religion sounds pretty good. Organized religion is mostly shit.

But that doesn't mean god isnt real. The New Testament is hostile to religion. Yeah, but get rid of the cast system first. Haha OP didn't point Jainism, Sikhism in his post, Jainism and Sikhism are the best religions!! /s Okay but if our existence is indeed pointless, why do scientists then proceed to do all they can to unlock the secrets to the universe and our planet, and to rationalise everything? Simply put, they fear the idea of being a tiny speck in the grand scheme, the same is said for the general public, and of the general public; religious people. Everyone has there own way of coping with insignificance, some people even like to be assholes, and take a lot minutes and even hours out of their miniscule time of existence to do just that, those people are you. If you can't respect other people's decisions and choices, how do you expect your own to be respected in return? Should people even take your opinion seriously if you continue like this? Remember that respecting someone's opinion is different to agreeing with it, if you disagree with their opinion, it doesn't meant you have to disrespect them. Just let people be, instead of creating a negative and depressing energy for everyone around you. After all, your existence is pointless and you can't do anything significant to change how the universe works, so why not just live out that existence in peace and happiness? Honestly I think religion is just a tool, like knife or gun and stuff. It will be just replaced to something else if we somehow erase it completely.

I really do understand religion's doing more bad than good nowadays, (our country's Coronavirus infectee's almost tripled thanks to one trashy believer) maybe it's just human nature to have conflict and discriminate. Obviously I do not think both are good, but seeing the world made me think that way. You just started another one! Well, that's just, like, your opinion, man...

The Big Lebowski The Way I see religion is it’s a way to follow life even if it means nothing in the end it’s part of our species at this point and I think it’s just nice to follow somthing in life kinda like a government you specifically address supernatural religions in this rant / well-put point. what about naturalistic religions? Modern Satanism for example  \- Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova. 

I am actually really looking forward to the opportunity to be part of a supernova. Seriously though look at the Catholic church and the Vatican i keep reading reports about these sick fucks molesting children and they think once they die THEY are going to heaven? HAHAHA The pope is such a farce get fucked you sick child molesting ass clowns.
#FUCKALLRELIGION I mean I don’t believe in any religion either, but the people who do aren’t hurting anybody by believing in something more, and it makes them feel better. Atheism is a religion just like other religions. Religion poisons everything You sure do have a strong distaste for something you don't believe in. Interesting. Tell me more about how or what I should believe. Thanks. I discovered this when I was 8. Fuck you too :). If heaven exists, a Muslim might go to heaven. A Christian might go to heaven. A jew might go to heaven. But a Atheist is forever in the grave r/atheism is leaking This sounds like the “talk” every religion has right before trying out that mass murder thing you speak of. Maybe human nature is more to blame join a group>become fanatical>fuck shit up. It’s the rinse and repeat of mankind acting super special cause you have the answer. Not wanting to start anything just know that one search and word replace and you become the people you’re bitching about. The biggest problem with religion has always been the people. They try to twist the words to fit their world view and when they need to do that it is never about their god anymore. Let us blame everything on religion, and absolutely not on humans lust, greed, wrath, envy, pride, gluttony and avarice. Sure it is easy for you to hate on religion when you feel abandoned by the entity that we call god. 

Do you really believe that we advanced in technology because we ""worked together"" or is it who can dominate who first? 

Humans are a spectrum that goes from evil to good and people are spread out in that spectrum, and very few people are really fking pure and are good but alot of people are fking evil. We manipulate, we decieve, we conspire and we kill for our gain. Religion is a trend that nations use to motivate if there was no religion there would be something else to motivate people to kill and rape. Don't put it on religion because you are so fking arrogant and ignorant to your leaders and humanity.  

You say religion is a fairy tail but what you are talking about is the biggest fairytail there is, people working together, holding hands and dancing to we are the world. Sit your fking ass down you clown. Let me ask you this how the fk do you know that there is nothing after death, the very argument you use to ""put religius people in place"" is a two edged sword, how the fk do you know that there is nothing after death? 

Let people believe what they want to believe, jesus we have people that thing there are billions of genders, and media is fking supporting them and condemming religion. You are a puppet my friend we all are so stop acting like you know whos behind the scene nobody knows in the end we all will die and by then will figure out whos right and whos wrong, id rather be religius and die if there is something after death il be doing fine and if there is nothing il be fine too, but guess if there is something after death and it is one of those religius beliefs that is ""right"" and you are an athiest who shittalked people for being religius guess where you are going my friend... hell or being reincarneted as you again you cunt. Christians in America especially. I love to read about ancient history and one thing I've learned is that most Christians don't have a clue how the bible was written or how it was rewritten. I highly suggest Misquoting Jesus if anyone wants a deep dive. Most Christians just blindly follow and believe whatever they are told, and that imo is a cult lead by false prophets. Christians are such ignorant children. I agree.
But i think when christianity first got invented it might have had some actually good things to say.
The sad thing is emperors used religion to control people rewriting the bible while doing so.
And now it's full of random stuff that is only there because it was useful to some person in a high position. Chill bhai What you are all referring to is organised religion. Organised religion is a huge cause of death and unrestbut normal religion is fine. Chill. Not to seem like that guy, but our sun will not go supernova, rather it will expand as a red giant and then shrink to a white dwarf where it will remain dominant with the earth added to it. Also you cant just rudely tell people to abandon religion and expect them to listen.

Edit- I am a retard and cannot spell Yea same Religion can be a source of evil, but most of the values they teach give guidence and hope to people to live good lives, I believe that many people have realized religion is bullshit and any creation story for fables are made up. But the message they teach can help those in their darkest hour

You never hear about people leading good lives from religion but only the horrors of greed and power hungry corrupt members. To smear the brush wide you forget the benefits that these organizations create too. So personally, fucking them all isn't a fair assessment of the situation to be honest Religion is opium for the masses. I can joke about Jesus without fear of being killed. Lol at people arguing over which country is the least worst. If anyone here thinks religion is worthless or that we are better off without it, you haven’t engaged with religion on a serious, academic level, which means you don’t understand a crucial aspect of humanity. You don’t understand human culture. Every religion offers vital insights into the collective unconscious of human cultures. Highly recommend reading Nietzsche’s “Thus Spoke Zarathustra” or honestly any work by Carl Jung. Wanting to get rid of religion is like throwing the baby out with the bath water. How many wars do not have their roots in religion?  A retired general once told me he had studied it during his time in the forces and he couldn't find any.  Is this true? Damn son, who hurt you? Big mood [deleted] A fitting song

[Propagandhi - Haille Sellasse, Up Your Ass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPpXY1aWKgI) I think it was Jaggi Vasudev who said something along the line of “to believe in god is ignorance, to not believe in god is ignorance “ in relation to observation perception and fundamental human growth. Basically stay in our own lane but don’t act haughty. While what they believe in may be fiction, they still believe in it. Even if you want to believe otherwise, religion has a very prominent impact on our society, and we have to understand and accept that. To say “fuck Religion” on Reddit isn’t exactly a means to an end. ""I think it's a waste of time"" cool, and you're allowed to, just like I'm allowed to be a christian. Stop going out of your way to shit on things that bring people peace just because you're bitter and unhappy Would be cool if people cited their rants more often. The Middle East is living proof that Religion is cancer. Especially when it takes control of the government. Go owfff Wow this started a whole war in the comments 😂 Probably not* the best way to start that claim. Preach it brother! Not takings sides here but let’s call any religion what it truly is ... an organized belief system.  Since we live in a world where things create other things, there must be something (aka God, Buddha, Allah etc?) to help explain the creation of man in order to convince, control, and organize the vulnerable believers. More people have been killed on this earth over religion than any other means ... we need to stop the madness!!!! I haven’t read all this. But about 2 years ago I felt exactly the same way. I absolutely DESPISED religion with a burning passion as well as 99% of the people who believe in it.

I’m not a practicing religious person by any means, but I know now there is more out there, outside of what we can touch. I had a spiritual awakening similar to when people take DMT but I didn’t take any drugs and it lasted about 6 months before I realised what was going on. Thought I was going insane at first. Either way, calm down lol. You’re showing your age. We ourselves are more to blame rather than ""religion"".
Fuck all of us! The reason that I am not an atheist, is because it is entirely unhelpful. I gain nothing from it whereas from christianity I gain happiness and companionship. 
Another way I have always looked at it is:

Atheism:
                Best case scenario: nothing |
                Worst case scenario: hell

Religion:
               best case scenario: heaven |
               Worst case scenario: nothing

Edit: formatting Let me change ""Fuck all Religion"" to ""Fuck all conservative religion"". If your religion makes you close your mind then yes fuck your religion. Fuck India and all the awful assholes that answer phones for American companies there... I know the negative impact of the religious sentiments but its not all bad, it does give a answer to questions like why is it wrong to commit suicide or murder. While undoubtedly everyone should form their own belief system instead of believing in anyone but i think we are quite far away from there, cause if you reject religion that can descend into nihilism and that is not exactly a good belief system if your life is going downhill, that is basically like flirting with suicide, so i the bleakest of moment religion can be a ray of light and its all empowering when it concern only the individual but lets be honest here religion always end up becoming institutionalized. My reply: (deep breath) I know it's funny to be an edgy 13 year old that trashed on religion and then point out others are meaningless since you know you're life is meaningless but here's a fact. The biggest removal of religion in the USSR killed hundreds of times more than religion did in history. Ugh fuck off shit dude, let people live their lives. i’m not even religious but chill 🤣 Penis. South park is !y religion Here’s the big problem with what you are saying. We all don’t know for sure if God or gods are real. But a lot of people choose to believe because there sad and depressed and need love. So think about what your gonna say before you say it. Also scientists still have not found concrete proof that we evolved from something in the water. And there is the fact they can’t replicate fossilization. Look it up!!! I believe in God, not religion. Genuinely asking but why do a lot of you hate religion? Saying that their is no greater Being or after life eventually leads to nihilism. If we're just a speck in space and in the end I get nothing and the world just implodes, why not kill myself and everyone else off? Why even live? It doesn't matter in the end does it?

I'm not a religious fanatic myself, but their is value in religion and it's teachings. Morals eventually derive from some form of religion. Just because there was bad done by people claiming to be religious, doesn't mean all religion is bad does it?

Science has created the atomic bomb. Science has led to guns and mustard gas. But not all science is bad is it? Science has made medical advancements and has  increased life expectancy.

Religion has given a lot of people a sense of direction and morality. I gurantee there are more Christian's helping those starving in Africa than atheists. Gurantee it.

I hope all of you understand where I'm coming from and I understand where a lot of you are coming from. There have been a lot of religious assholes. But it has also help guide us in terms of science and morality. It's not all bad. You can choose what to believe but don't shit on all religion because it had some bad eggs. 

Best to all of you! 

The problem doesn't lie in religion itself but the institutionalization happed after they were formed. I am a Hindu and I like to read different school of thoughts in  sanatan dharma. The main problem of today's religion and their followers is they have very institutionalized thought processes. India is the land of seekers. We have embraced atheism long before it was ""Cool"". You can look for Charvaka school of philosophy which is basically seeking truth in the form of materialism and atheism. I partly agree that religion is root cause of major problems in world today but that is not because of religion it self but what humans did with it. We pitted each religion against each other to justify our war mongering nature. If you closely observe historical timeline you'll observe that majority of wars that were fought on basis of religion, were in times when there were very few advances in philosophies of each religion. Religion is meant to serve personal values but unfortunately we humans have used it to justify our actions. 

For the fellow atheists here, I respect your choice of atheism. But we are the part devil of this world as well. And lastly why don't we blame Science for creation of nuclear weapons which can annihilate world in matter of minutes? We can't, cause we know that it's devil that we created ourselves out of nuclear science just like we did with religion and created intolerance, terrorism etc. Science and religion are two very powerful philosophies but their right use depends on us. Lmao ok boomer There's a difference. I do have some faith that there is a God, I just don't believe in religion. Religion is run like a business... For someone who hates religion you sure do talk about it a lot ha ha. Honestly you just sound angry, and hurt. HOLLA! yea religion is not the reason people kill and hate eachother. Its a human nature. Lots of animals kill eachother as well,even their own species and they are not religious as far as I know Boedhism ain't a religion per se. This post is wildly hateful. Tread carefully India. I say we just exterminate the human race. Please donate to my cause You left out Judaism.  Slicing baby's dicks apart is the ultimate violation of human rights. To say something came from nothing is insanity. Are you insane? The desperation in trying to push your own beliefs on others suggest you are. Bro just live your life. When you die you will know for sure what is on the other side. Leave me out of it. I will can contest you on your claim that we evolved. Okay doomer The tipping is strong with this one. Religion is like a teddy bear. It was useful for our species in our infancy, when our ignorance needed some psychological crutch to calm us down in this scary universe. However, as we are about to enter our adult phase, it's past time we leave our psychological-comfort teddy bears behind. I think Indian societal norms are from that of the Stone Age. There’s hundreds of sexual assault cases there that don’t even get heard. Child abuse does not even faze the Indian public nor apparently does child trafficking nor child marriages. You try to make a fair argument, but the basic idea of religion is the shared belief on being moral.

It may sound like stating the obvious but there is a difference with being moral and in believing it.

To some it may be a small difference to others not.

(For example filtering the world in our conscience to have a good inner voice. What ever we think, we try to think in a certain positive way. 

Rather than not necessarily believing, and just see how we feel about the situation. How we process the world is Thus different. The filter is of our own making and random.

And it might affect a person in the sense they feel less empathy or care less especially when no one is watching.

They might forget to process things in a certain way, and their language might also change and their emotions as a result as well.)

But also to make things more obscure we are dealing with a world that is religious, so how can you say that people not believing in being good is going to make them better especially when no one is watching?

We are also dealing with a lot of benefits and welfare, what will happen to the morality of people in a moment of crisis if they don’t have the custom of believing in being good?

I can understand The want to make the world a better place, but freedom of religion is the best to hope for. Trying to change the dynamics too much is another uncertainty.

For example can you guarantee security and wealth so people are not dealing with circumstances that may be ‘believing’ morality will have more benefits than not (presumably).

I think if people want to make the world a better place it comes from those things in improving people’s lives. That is with technology. And I think we don’t quite have that level of technology to quite easily say that abandoning a belief system will be better. Since even being just moral, implies some kind of belief in a constitution to make it work in tough times, when no one is watching. For example almost every country is dealing with a significant amount of corruption, will them having less faith, or not having to pretend to be ‘faithful’ have more positive effects on corruption or not?

Ona global scale religion is different than before. The conversation regarding religion in public generally involves people being and ‘acting’ good. At least they have to ‘act’ good which is still important imo. There is a net benefit not just how it translate to a certain culture of caring, or good action but also the psychological impact it can have to be an inclusive society rather than one that is more capitalistic and is a dog eat dogs world.

I think by rejecting the belief in being good, rather than just common sense or common interests Of being good, can quickly shift human behavior to be more unhealthy. We can also look at humans being savage without laws and instructions. Their natural state is quite barbaric, which is why the point of technology and being a utopia is important. The barbaric humans of the past did not have a belief system and even if they did, their lives were too extreme to have a use for it. It took humans a long time to reach this level of society and religion was their crutch for good or bad. Which is why it is a big uncertainty due to their basic nature and their dependence on religion, to say wether they would be good without religion.

Just like philosophers of the past have studied human behavior and some will say humans need to be taught to be good to be good. ""Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing""

Same statement as believing in God, the fuck you know about post-death, how the fuck you can prove it. Religion isn’t meant to be a collection of stories, but an easier interpretation of complex morals and values.  Hinduism, specifically, is not a religion as Western Philosophy has deemed, but more so a lifestyle, a way of living.  It truly is a beautiful conception of our reality, in which each god is a symbol for humanly needs (Lakshmi for wealth, Hanuman for strength, Ganesha for perseverance, etc). And in turn, we use prayer to each God as a way to ease the mind and focus on one entity.  Hinduism says that we are all one, and oneness is derived from ultimately dissolving the ego.

Religion isn’t supposed to be a collection of fiction and stories, but a teaching of what life is.  It is a collection of teachings from many different individuals, who place these teachings in the format of stories so it is easier to understand. Disbelief in a god is also a belief itself. You cannot claim to know the universal truth when it is not possible. Thank the universe someone finally said it! Its not religion its confessions that harms humanity. You can try to think of an religion that simply believes in the power of love and set love above all other things. 
It would not harm humanity. By definition it cant harm humanity.
You get the point?
I think there was a guy called jesus. Might be he had an similar idea...
Point is the biggest utopies (e.g. Religions, communism) will always be most likely abused by people not believing in anything and harm humanity. Only a sith deals in absolutes Why you so mad ? 😟 Didn't know I was on r/cringe Op probably wouldn’t be so angry about what other people think if he found peace in religion, just saying. Lol eat a dick Religion is a crutch that was once required and helped greatly in the structure of societies, the problem is, like with anything, when it came time to move on from it, the people involved were earning too much money and garnered more respect and power than they ever could have on their own so they abused their power to stifle progress that would have made them obsolete.

 The problem now is indoctrination through repetition, and, although I understand your anger, arguments are seldom won by the person telling everyone else how stupid they are, especially when we (humanity/science) have only answered some of lifes questions and their religion offers all the answers, albeit wrong ones. Woah guys we have an edgy atheist here ok cool Religion is not a problem, people having different beliefs and values than you is not a problem. You are so blind to your hatred of people who believes differently than you to see your attitude is the problem. Your attitude is shared by people of religion about other religions, non-believers, and people who scare them because their different. Everyone wants to fit every body into their own box, instead of accepting the fact that people are going to believe how they choose to believe. I am a proud Christian and I love people, I have views that differ from the rest of the world I know that. I will never force my beliefs or views on others, but I expect the same respect from others. You have the right to feel the way you do, that’s ok, but to belittle people and a destructive and aggressive way is not the best way to address our differences. Learn to have respect for your fellow humans that believe differently than you, don’t box yourself in to a small area. Just my opinion take it for what you will /r/copypasta Religion isn't the problem it's the idiots that don't know how to follow religious values/rules. Yeah I’ll never get over how call culty organized religion is I will continue to be religious and not become a miserable prick like yourself. Enjoy your pessimistic lifestyle and tell me again about how my life beliefs make me as miserable and incorrigible as yourself! Believe what you want to believe but if it makes you this down on life I would think into other options my friend. Lol you clown Well said. Shut the fuck up. You don't know anything for a fact, just the same as a theist. Nobody knows what happens after death, nobody knows whether there's a God. Plenty of things divide us, not just religion. r/enlightenedcentrism This is so beautiful omg. 
Thanks for proving words can be breathtaking Wow so woke cause religion bad Yep all religion. Fuck your cross and for head burka shits. Amen. Fuck any God! Nah I'm good bruh r/EdgyAthiest Fuch ewe. have you died ? how do you know theres nothing after? energy never dies? oh waits its just YOUR belives. > You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter.  

This is a subjective claim, but I would argue that this is very wrong. As far as we know there is no other life in this universe except on Earth. Also, as far as we know there is no other form of life in the universe as intelligent as a human. The Earth may be a (giant to us) tiny speck floating in the vast expanse, but that expanse is speckled  with unliving and unintelligent stuff. As far as significance, the human race may be the most amazing product of the universe so far. Yarr this dude is going to HELL¡! Well that’s just like, your pinion man. Yes yes and fucking yes. Religion is the worst of all evils I'll  never understand why someone is so angry with something they dont have to be a part of  idgaf if you dont believe in what I believe in. That's your decision and I'm happy you have the right to believe what you want to believe.
Edit: typo This is bs.

1- He  stated facts that are not facts at all, like we coming from Africa 300k years ago, we dont know for sure.

2- He is against religion but then speak about we are nothing on the big schemes of things? This is actually paraphrasing many religions out there.

3- No one gives a shit about religion, wars are not made on religion, the people who creates wars, they just put a catchy name to it to force people to move but they themselves dont give two fucks about a war because of religion or resources.

3.1- Atheist also make as many wars as they please

4-Atheism is just another bs as well as religion you people are the opposite faces of the same coin. Everything u talk as well as deeply religious guys is pure trash. Dont you fucking think u are outside the bubble of human beings and think you are being objective, like that would be actually laughable.

5- Religious people as well as agnostics or atheists follow the same bs, thinking the have the reason and that they know it all. Lmao you guys give me a break. There is religion yes, but there is also a connection to the Universe that we all have. A connection that doesn’t require you to be religious. Religion has set us back so far it’s hilarious. I thought 18 was the minimum age for reddit No thanks As I was reading this post, I could only think of the Quote from ""Pale Blue Dot"" by Carl Sagan 

""  hat's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every ""superstar,"" every ""supreme leader,"" every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.

Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.

The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.

It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.   ""

We are nothing but mote of dust suspended in a sun beam. And here we are fighting in the name of the unknown. You can have your religions AND be loyal to your species. Don't worry about religion if you don't want a part in it. Every person is an individual autonomous person, so why are you going to spend so much time being against their decisions? Just enjoy your own way, and if these are your complaints, then be, in your character, the way  you want to see others in your world act. Just because some people are, of my personal opinion, stupid and warlike, doesn't really mean that Religion is the primary cause. Sure, religion is easy to blame, because people like to use it as a way to justify their aggression and transgressions by ""Invoking the law of the lord"" or some other mindless and willful reason.

People are afraid to change their ways of life, and religious discrimination has been the main cause of unrest in India, usually not religion in and of itself. Religion is a positive thing, you can't just stop something from existing because you hate it. How about nurturing it into something that can actually be positive and helpful to the world?

Avoiding conflict is often as simple as moving forward. When you put down your weapons and abandon your conflicts, progress happens. Happy lives can happen. Simple as that.

EDIT: After sifting through some comments, I think what OP may be expressing is the lack of an outlet for those who are not interested in religion whatsoever. And that's fine. I think that non-religious culture greatly benefits the interests of everyone. Just a matter of waiting for people to wake the fuck up. Amen brother. A-fukken-men. Interesting Post detailing you opinion. I don't want to start an debate because God knows its been done before by men/women more better versed than myself. 

As a scientist, I am left with evidence that points to the existence of an all powerful all knowing God. 

Matter and Energy Exists: Where did it come from? Another universe? Maybe but where did that come from? Our universe requires causality but what caused the first cause? Perhaps something without a cause, without beginning nor end. 

Matter and Energy Behaves in a constant manner: We know there are attractive and repulsive forces which dictate bonding and energy levels but we have no idea why this is the case. Its like a universal ""settings"" tab running the background keeping the laws that govern this universe constant. 

Also, saying F\*ck all religious doesn't make you sound too smart. cheers, ill drink to that Ummmmm ya Amen. Talk about tolerance of other beliefs eh?
One of the main reasons India will never thrive because it's people don't have tolerance so you can Hindus in charge the country will be a shithole, you can have Atheists in charge the country in charge but until you develop tolerance for other beliefs you will be stuck in the stone age. Actually religion has brought peace to me. Fuck modi and his cronies. He’s a top class chutiya. He’s the hitler of the brownies. Let’s be honest. That’s what this post should have been about. For thousands of year people have co-existed and also they had their fair share of wars. So much hatred is out there😓 I can't believe it still exists in 2020. Glad the trends say it's going away Fuck people who try to push their beliefs onto others. That includes you. Yikes. I disagree. Wait, not Jainism. Right? Sir this is a mcdonalds Fuck you Fuck you! Imagine if people got into wars over whether or not Santa was real. As an Indian, I approve of this sentiment. I will gladly vote for a politician who runs on a policy of abolishing religion from our country and from the face of this world. Any plans of running? i was born in a muslim family, same here, i think religions are nothing but some kind of culture. Let the enlightenment spread.  It is time. We are alone on a rock floating through space, we have invented everything on this planet and “gods” are for people who cannot hang with the idea of the endlessness of the universe.  It’s time to move on to space. PRAISE r/cornbible I do not belive in God or ANY religion.

BUT

You have to be an even bigger moron than the biggest religious zealot to say, WITHOUT A DOUBT, that there is nothing after death. Simply saying to yourself that there 100% cannot be anything makes you look like an idiot. Can you time travel? Can you travel to the beginning of time? No? Then stop acting like you can. Nobody knows. There is probably nothing but nobody knows except people that have died. Fanatism and lack of education go hand-in-hand. Every time I hear about religion riots in India, inevitably follows another report with lives lost. Reminds me of the ""holy wars"" of medieval Europe. Amen! y’all are so pathetic it’s sad i actually believe in a dimension where all dead people go, but i aint believing in a zombie On an unrelated note, I felt like playing DOOM 2016 after reading this. I don't think Buddhism counts here, especially Zen. While I don't agree with religion in alot of context especially when used hypocritically or to cause harm , there is alot of truth in myth , in archetypes , consciousness and practices especially in buddhism. Take rebirth for example, from a scientific standpoint if the universe created life why cant it decompose it then create a new stucture from it. Your Belief isn't going to replace certain truths and reality especially in things like consciousness. However in terms of childish belief people are more unreasonable and unreliable than any religious teachings lol. See your statement of you do not matter but matter exist is contradictory in nature, & even things like immortality isn't such a far-fetched concept as technology progresses so are we suppose to abandon science when that becomes religion and then passes into myth. I remember my fifteenth birthday too, good times. >Fuck Hindusim, fuck Islam, fuck Christian, fuck Buddhism.  
>  
>Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing. Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova.  
>  
>You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter. But matter itself is being part of this universe.

You just described Buddhism. Amén! Ok Better to be a non-organized spiritualist then be a member of any kinda specific religion. Your points are highly valid tho. Can't saying this kind of thing get you in trouble in your country? Ironically, in trying to stop divisions your anger and hostility may create them, people are more receptive to calm and well-argued people. 

I'm religious, the only thing i oppose in your argument is that religion is made up. That is it. Yes we die. Yes there may not be anything beyond this. Yes violence is bad. Yes religion is very divisive. Yes your legacy should be based on being good to mankind. 

You're angry, that's fine. But in the end people will always believe in religion, your anger only seeks to do the thing you don't want, make divisions. Calm down. What do you say to the people who's religion helped them become a better person? Is this a new religion? Amen. But you go to the moon before clean water and sanitation. Have fun shitting in rivers... the Roman’s had fucking sewers but India says fuck it let’s go to the moon. Because our brains create problems, I can see how religion seems like a problem. But, on the other hand, because our brains will religify just about anything, I can see how not having any at all would make them all that more difficult to trace, and therefore dangerous to battle. We all tend towards the worship and zealotry of something, the religious are just surprisingly less delusional on this point than the non-religious. All cultures have had three things in common since time immemorial 

Art

Music

Religion 

Religion is hardwired into us for some reason. Plus there are so many mysteries in this world that really can’t be explained. Look up reincarnated children on YouTube. Not that reincarnation has anything to do with religion. Religions have adopted reincarnation as a perk, however. I feel the same way about reality shows like Nach Baliye and Dance Plus. Fuck all ya'll for watching crap TV and encouraging them to make more, you're just filling your minds with pointless crap.

Boredom is good for your mental health. Saying that there is no experience after death is just as flawed as saying that there is experience after death. It is true they religion has caused many problems in the world, but you don’t know any better than anyone else does. By acting like you do, you are just as toxic as a close minded religious person. It’s funny someone can believe so wholeheartedly something so specific happened 300,000 years ago but completely dismiss something else. What u believe doesn't matter 👹👹😾😾 I hate that people are allowed to be taught religion by their parents. Especially Islam. Islam is designed only for the purpose of oppressing women, but even the women don't realize it because they're taught that it's okay essentially from birth. Lol you sound young. *grabs popcorn* If anyone commits violence in the name of religion, it's settled; they're a massive Mcfucknugget. Yo who didn't fuck their mans right Amen. ""Open your mind"" 😂. And yet they're telling people what to believe. [deleted] Atheistic Anarchism will be the real salvation of humanity. Whot is this india The main cause of strife in the world is jackasses trying to tell everybody else what to do.

  

Sit down, shut up and chill TFO. So much hate in this post. :( Darwin Award tl:dr Fuck freedom of choice, fuck culture, fuck age, fuck gender, fuck me hating cheese, fuck you hating me hating cheese, fuck ducks, fuck kids, fuck moms, fuck language,  duck you, fuck me, fuck everybody

Welcome to the divided world
By design
Not my design

It reminds me of the second renassaince, animatrix ""....and for a time, it was good..."" Just putting it out here that atheists are just as idiotic/smart as the people who believe in religion. If you want to ""Fuck"" religion, try being agnostic. You go nowhere with a closed ideology of atheism. WORD My faith makes me happy, i don't push it onto anyone, i just practise it myself. I don't see why i should leave that, your post is grossly generalizing.

It also brings me and my local community togther, which is nice for the many who aren't equipped with stable social lives. Jesus loves you Woah there This is some real Cosmicism thinking. 10s of thousands of years of theology? Obliterated, reduced to mere atoms. Christards? Owned 😎 It really just depends on what we really believe in. If you believe in God then just believe. Then there are others that might be making up beliefs then calling it ""religion.""

God may be true to some but Religions are definitely man-made beliefs. Coming from r/all. If it’s forced or violent like it is in India of course. But you need to be able to believe what you believe in. some people just need it for hope. So fuck the religion that is inciting violence in India. I think we all secretly know this, but it's a nice distraction to believe in it instead of just believing that we're all gonna just die and become nothing. At least that's why I believe in religion. Religion isn’t evil, people are.

Sorry to burst your bubble love, but you seem a lot more childish with your little temper tantrum then any random religious person just minding their own business. 

I understand where you’re coming from, to atheists people of faith may easily appear as delusional fools who pray to a god to make themselves feel better about their existence...but who are we to take that from them? Who are we to snatch away their hope so cruelly? If it makes them happy, and indeed, encourages them to live a more moral lifestyle for fear of god’s wrath or the afterlife, then what is the harm? 

You accuse them of being foolish to believe in man made stories, but science is the same in that regard...in my eyes, the latter has far more credibility, but it is still just another concept manning has come up with in a desperate attempt to explain the word around us. 

It is, with all due respect, simply idiotic to say religion is the only thing that divides us...mankind is capable of deep kindness and empathy, but we are also capable of mindless hatred and violence. It is not religion to blame, but us. We allow any and all differences to divide us, be they religion, economic status, race, nationally, gender, sexual identity, or even age...it is foolish to try and blame religion for the endless bloodshed we cause. 
Indeed, it could easily be argued that, using your vehement rant as an example, it is also the very lack of religion that divides people.

I am not claiming religion is a force for good, but it is not a force for evil either. Merely a tool, used and twisted by humans for their own purposes. Some use it for good, spreading love and support, others use it to pit people against each other. Attack the people misusing it, not the religion itself. Do not give those people the excuse of blaming their religion. Their actions are their own.

Being an atheist does not mean you have to hate religion, or people who follow one. We pride ourselves on our oh so great logic, and then go around mindlessly mocking and hating people of faith, for what? Because it provides an easy scapegoat for us to take our frustrations with the world out on? If it helps them live a happier life, so be it! 

Live and let live!

Sorry for the long and drawn out response everyone, but I cannot understand why atheists insist on such a harsh attitude towards religion. 

Just because someone of some religion may have hurt you, doesn’t make religion inherently bad. Indeed, there are elements of religions that anyone could benefit from, e.g. meditiation

I’d highly recommend Alain de Botton’s ‘Religion for Atheists’ to anyone who’s interested :) Damn dude, you sound so certain. I’ll pray for you. lol Happy birthday! Seems unfair to lump in Buddhism with the others, it’s really more of a philosophy or way of thinking than a true religion. Soooo edgy. Regardless of how you feel about religion, its hard to deny that having a belief system and being forced to believe you have accountability for your actions in this life is not a bad thing for most people. This rant sounds reads like an adolescent emotional outburst. Chances are something in your past with religion has you stuck in an angry place. There certainly is value in discussing the worth of religion in general or just one in particular, but this is off the mark. Come back at it after you figure out what's really hurting you so bad. I mean we really don't know though, let people live. Those who try to force you to live or act some certain way can surely get fucked. I am not religious at all, but you talk about death like you died and came back to tell us what happened. You don't know that there is no rebirth or what happens after death. Get off your non-religious pedestal. You could make a religon out of this! Is it that time of the month? Many prayers needed here for many lost souls! I pray you learn and accept the truth before it’s too late! God sent us his only Son to be sacrificed so we can enter the kingdom of heaven. He died to save us as we are all sinners. Yes I am a Christian but I don’t believe in any specific religion. All you're doing with this post is isolating every religious person from your cause and contributing to the stereotype that atheists are unreasonable Tldr... but i agree. That's one opinion Whoever you are i love u! “The only that happens is you blackout and stop existing” 

Please prove that.

Y’all atheists have so much fucking hate You preaching the fact there is no god is the same as someone shoving religion down your fucking throat. You are as much of a cunt as the Pope. You're also a pussy if you're wondering. Ive recently been coming to terms with how ridiculous I think it is that everyone blames god for their success.  God didn't create modern technology, or scientific breakthroughs, or medical breakthroughs..

We did.  Human beings did all of it.  Everyone says how amazing God is, but they're all wrong.  Its not God who is amazing.  It is us that is amazing. bruh chill the fuck out, check out nihilism btw. Preach brother! Who is God to a non believer. I don’t like any religion. I’d rather have a simple life without thinking who i’m offending by not doing things by their bullshit superstitious sense.
I don’t know if religion is the problem or not. But i will say this: people have forgotten the faith that comes with the religion. They forgot that the biggest thing they need to do while worshipping their god is believing in him no matter what others say. If you get offended when someone questions or makes fun of your religion, then i’m sorry to say, its not having faith, its just being a fan of something and defending it just for selfish reasons (to prove that you can never be or choose something wrong). There’s no reason to be physical or offensive by other’s remarks, because what religion is only an agnostic’s benefit of doubt. Not sure I'd class Buddhism a religion. It can be if you want to believe all the made up magical shit. But it's more of a self help guide. someone needs to get laid The only part I disagree with is what happens when you die.. no fade to nothingness. Instead we’ll all be trippin our balls off on DMT. You’ve lost. You can make a religion out of this. You need Jesus You are going to be very surprised when you die.  I would not take the chance.  Besides, we all have to believe in something.


Its OK..I k ow you are made, but. Don't be made at religion..that's just crazy.

So, what is really the PROBLEM? oof To “blackout” is difficult to grasp if there is nothing further. If mind does not go further it cannot know “blackout”. Well written piece. I do have some questions. 


Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. 
- Does this involve not caring about other species? Because religion does involve loyalty, to a point it’s blind. 


We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion. 
-yeah, no on that. If you have a darker skin colour it doesn’t matter to some, who or what you believe in. Also, let’s learn from a war that is now known as the Second World War. Any suggestions how to go about these differences? 

As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed. 
- Not always: ask anti-vaccine people among others


Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. Fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.
- I don’t agree with this statement, but holy cow, does history and recent events make it hard to disprove. Nothing divides us except religion? LOOL talk about someone not living in the real world. Now your are starting to get it.. God would not want to restrict his children but let them have their own free will. Name one religion where they preach free will over what they tell you are their standards.. Sir, this is a Wendy's. Sjw think its a unpopular opinion and they can go fuck themselves Amen. This is some good shit right here. I'm glad you said it man because this is shit i want to tell people every single day. The world would be immensely better without religion. Im underage and my parents force me to Go to church every Sunday morning i fins It a waste of time too >A little over 300,000 years ago we emerged as Modern Humans in Africa. We learnt to make tools, tamed fire, hunt in groups and mine for obsidian to make tools and eventually farming. We left Africa about 200,000 years ago, we started farming, domesticating animals and started making clay potteries, we started to harness the power of fire to make pots, utensils, and brick. Then we discovered copper, using the very technology we developed to make pots and brick. Bronze was the next step in this technological progress of controlling fire. Then 3,000 years ago iron was discovered, iron could only be extracted, when humans were able to raise the temperature of fire to above 1900 °C wherein iron started to melt from the ore. With this came the era of technological leap from stronger transport vehicle, ships and communications. Faster connection to the world via roads made using these steal and iron tools. We made great leaps in terms of medicine, physics, maths and chemistry. These technological progress not only made our life better but also extended our life expectancy for 30 years to 60 years on an average. And then about 300 years ago we entered the industrial revolution that gave us mass production, luxury items for everyone and communications ability to talk to people in real time across the globe. In less than a 100 years we went from a globe that relied on telephone and telegraph , steam ship and sailboat, to a globe that now has video calling, the ability to access the repository of all human knowledge literally in the palm of your hand. **The modern world we live in is because of people working together to bring technology and social welfare to all. But this evil thing call religion is dead set on taking us humans back to the Stone age.**

You're full of shit, buddy. All those discoveries Man found and made use of also facilitated murder, genocide, and invasions. This was done *eons* before the concept of religion was ever a thing, yet you don't point that out.

>Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion.

Except genetic research have discovered many biological nuances in different ethnicities. So no, we are not the same.

>As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed.

The same science that created the atomic bomb? The same science that is behind mass surveillance threatening our privacy?

>Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. Fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.

Absolutely brilliant analysis, Lord Edge. yeah fuck god for making us suffer because some bitch ass took a bite from an apple It’s all nice saying all this but the fact of the matter is that the world you’ll I’ve in now has been shaped by religion, from the laws we have to infrastructures and landmarks so it can be said that religion is very much integrated into our society and it ain’t budging. As long as you practice your chosen faith and it isn’t affecting anyone else then yeah you be you. But religion ain’t going anywhere anytime soon soooooooooooooo..... deal with it I guess. 

Also don’t think religion is a bad thing, it’s given meaning to many peoples lives and this is where people comment of all the terrorism and wars....

Listen I don’t deny them but all throughout history there have been humans that do atrocious things, not religion. A philosophy can’t force you to do anything, it’s man that has committed those crimes. E.g Ghent is Khan, hitler - was denounced from Christianity, tried to create his own sect. Etc... Average redditor Sir, this is a Wendy's Amen to that :D no seriously totally agree I believe religions are a for of social psychology I only know that I don’t know Why no rebirth?? We were born already once right?? You're saying that cant happen again?? Goddamn there's so much hatred in this post? Did a priest put something in your butt? Did a Muslim bang your sister? It must suck to have that much negativity and hate you your mind all the time holy shit lol. And yet, at the end of the day, the epistemology of OP is exactly the same as a person of faith. There’s a lot of anger/pain in this post, but ultimately who truly knows with 100% certainty? No one. Humans divide thrmselves among many other factots aside from religion such as politics, race, income and even miniscules things like liking a band or if you're even a 'real fan'. The danger of religion is that not only do not a lot of people respect the authority which is God but people don't even believe in him as you cannot see or hear him and as a result logically it's fuckin stupid to believe in such a ridiculous  notion as God. If religion were to dissappear from this world would the world be a better place-probably not. As humans we will divide and fight with each other over other factors which will cause new problems. At the core of it as humans we always fight and divide ourselves with political and philosophical ideologies that aren't even extreme in nature as well as the ones that are naturally violent and call for violence. Buddhism’s pretty cool but, not really a profit machine just like an intrinsic sorta thing. Idk I’ve always respected it How about Rastafarianism? Ngl India is the most wretched place on this planet. Then life would be pointless. Bet op deals with constant mental issues and isn't far from suicidal. ...on the other hand, imagine how frighteningly overpopulated our planet would now be without the endless centuries of Divinely Deferential human slaughter.
""Attention Please: Converts, brunch is now being served in the dining hall; Blasphemers, report at once to the Client Intake window located in the East Concourse beside Death Pit 47-B."" I feel like this post is as likely to convince a religious person to drop religion as it is to try and convert OP to whatever religion Funny thing here about the writer of this rant regarding F*** all Religions.. Wonder if he/she in anytime in their lifes had prayed to God for anything.. I believe in a God...I don't have to hear him or see him to know something is responsible for the making of us for better or worse As much as I agree with this statement, it seems you have some historical facts wrong. I may be wrong too, but I'm pretty sure we didn't make tools from obsidian (at least that early), homo sapiens migrated out of Africa around 70 000 years ago, we started farming around 11 000 years ago, bricks were invented around 7500 BC and pottery around 30 000 BC, iron melts at 1500°C and was found around 6000 BC. Also I've never heard of a religion that's trying to take us back to the stone age.


And yes, I am fun at parties. How can you claim to know what happens after death? You have just as much or less proof for your atheistic, nihilistic, scientific world-view as any religious person does for theirs. Here are some fun facts about Equador. Im not from there but i talked to a girl from there that is a police officer and she told me about some laws and punishments they have for breaking them. The city she lives in is almost entirely atheist. If you get married in a church or you baptise your child in a church you will face 40 years of jail time. I know it sounds ridiculous but for example punishment for killing an animal or even abusing it is 35 years in jail, so i guess it could make sense. In my country on the other habd you got massive protests and religious walks about some law that gives the state right to take tax from churches and its property. Property in question are hotels, beaches, and so on that belong to church and that isnt paying any tax because it belongs ti the church. Dozens of millions of euros goes over those properties and nothing is taxed until now and people are mad because 'goverment is stealing the holy property to themselves'. Like wtf, those priests drive most expensive cars in my country, and yet people that barely even goes to church are defending them blindly like church stands above the state and ni laws apply to it. They want to drag us back couple of hundreds years in the past. So yes. Religion is the biggest problem in the world, and world woukd be much better and more peaceful if there wasn't any religions. Most wars were started because of religion, and all those beliefs in The Bible are pure mythology and fantasy, and it involves a lot if gore and sacrificing of people. Like yeah Noah lived over 300 years and people believe that. If you think this is about religion, you're very sorely wrong. 
It's tribalism; My group vs your group
This has absolutely nothing to do with religion and you know it. 

Religion is God's elicudiation of the proper lifestyle for man. What was best for him.

You're as delusional to believe in evolution (not all evolution) as the reason for humanity existing as it. Is today. You nor any scientist has EVER OBSERVED this type of change in a species over time. 
When you DO LET ME KNOW,  CAUSE IT'S NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN.

The people who don't have values and respect for each other are often born into religion. Then they don't care for it so they mold it into something for their own devices. Hence the people who can't understand when to fight and when not to. 

Islam is around 15% of India. If you expect them to do nothing and not defend themselves you lack as much empathy as the people fightning now. The Catholic church did get on Galileo’s case about his findings back then. I find it ridiculous that the Pope hasn’t condemned the ignorance of the early days of the church on its stance on astronomy and science. But it helps the needy and poor. It also teaches you good morals. /s Tbh youre right but I know that theyre so many bad things threw religion, which also even god hated he hated that we were killing people and then because of the bad things they did he punished them. But still I'm a believer I do understand your perspective tho which is also kinda mine. Im still kinda thinking tho but Imma still believe cuz the reward is higher in the long run IF its real so imma end it with amen peace bro. u/userleansbot You're  having that kind of bad day huh .

Heard about religious factions killing each other in Indians . Better hope you are right.. This is amazing. Thank you. I want to share it with every religious person I know. I don't know why this much hate on religion without actually knowing one. Religion Fandom is the oldest, You know what's current ? Cristiano Ronaldo Vs Messi, XBOX vs PS4, Castes, Region, Race, Color, etc..See I respect your views that Religion is a problem but Religion is not a problem, It became a problem because we are feeding a radical group called RSS and a Political Party name BJP. Who trying there best to highlight this Fandom of people. It's like One African came into your society and That one aunty who slowly told you one news, fact, history or fake information regarding the situation of African in africa, Slowly that one aunty became a group and one day society committee will bring up the issues and soon that family needs to leave the society. Same If you are bachelor. Even If you don't do anything bad some societies eventually kick you out because some so and so aunty feed the ears of society head that you were doing this and that.. Instead of Blaming the religion, We need to tackle this power.

When a PM said ,"" You can identify them by their clothes "" 
Yes, No religion teach Hate. No atheism or No Humanity taught you to hate on the basis of anything, be it religion or If you are the fan of Messi and I'm of Ronaldo. You making comments on reddit, by using your smartphone maybe, Quote what ? That's like last 200 years or so ? You know how easy a human mind distracts from things ? Did you know that, If your father said to you that Ohh boy use that Radio and listen songs, Your reply would be ,"" No dad, I have my smartphone "". You once used a DVD now not, Everything changes so fast. Science, technology etc. 

Did you know that religion in human history is one of the oldest and that So called Fandom is still going pretty strong. A human brain, who changes so frequently, throughout eras drop various things but why not religion ? Did you ever try to put your thoughts on that ? Why Religion is the Oldest stuff we got with us. Man People came and go, Many years fall apart, Civilizations come and go, technologies and Everything but this religion is still up in Human Life. 
So...I'm not an atheist but Whatever..I know someone created us and religion and everything going on is what the creater wishes for. We are in a movie which got a start and end. Watches one hitchens video What evidence do you have for this, that racism is being pushed further from core society. Look around you, racism is also integrated into the very structure of our society. Akala explains this very well if you watch a video of his. 

And remember, racism isnt an actively negative act to most. Religion is held in a different respect, like I said it has given meaning to most peoples lives and only small groups have taken advantage of it and become extremes of it. Truth be told if every religious person was “destructive” and dangerous then the whole world would be screwed because there would a civil war in every country. The truth is that, especially on reddit, people create perceptions of religions that deviate from the truth due to confirmation bias. What most on this site call echo chambers. 
This isn’t to say there aren’t any problems in religion. Long time ago I learned myself to manage not to fall in this religion dogma's. 
Believe it guys, it's really nice to see around. There are lot to see. Do you realise that by fucking all religions you become an atheist? Do you also realise that even atheists are kafirs? So unless you a paedophilic Mohammed follower, your life will be fucked up anyway. Better fuck Islam. Well said, well said! Agree with most of the comments here. Religions is the main root cause of unsettlements like wars, etc. We cannot deny that it is the inevitable result of our imaginations, the driving force that distinguishes us from other animals. It has contribute towards the advancement of human history.
Please refer to the book Sapiens: brief history of makind. Gives a more insightful and less biased view on religion. I don't particularly like the ideological references in response to violence, I do enjoy their message of peace,harmony and humanity as a brotherhood of one rather then a nation of many. 

The Nacaals never taught religion but they did mention the Grand Architect who is also referred to as ""Yahweh, God, etc. 

It's unfortunate individuals used that knowledge to pursue goals of greed and profit, to turn a coin off information of wealth. 

When we noticed your hearts weren't ready, we rescinded and left, in hopes in the future you could reach ascension and reach a higher vibrational attunement with the cosmos and the Grand Architect. 

You humans are so clueless as to what you are and as to why your DNA was programmed in such a manner to exist as a tangible organism and as a energetic electro-magnetic essence which travels through the galaxy using the ambient energy as highways through ""space-time"". 

Keep searching for answers, keep questioning the obvious, their are forces out their trying to supress your ascension and the consul suggests we not interfere untill you reach your ""pinnacle"". FUCK JUDAISM! Bravo Sooooo... Religion bad... But the industrial age good?

Humans have done more damage to the Earth in the past century than all the tens of thousands of years prior combined--and it's not because of religion that we've desecrated the world. That's for sure. That’s just one article instead of running your keyboard perhaps you should do some research . You can find the studies that have been done, I personally believe you are more competent than you act.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/abcnews.go.com/amp/Technology/computer-scientists-prove-god-exists/story%3fid=20678984 Well, since you said so. SMH. Im sorry for what you have experienced, but not all religion is the same. Some are misinterpretations of Gods word, and many are meant to manipulate.
Personally i have witnessed miracles, and the existance of God is irrefutable to me, but i know that not all have that luxury.

Anyone who judges you for non-belief when you havent seen the work of God is mislead, as you are only responsible for what you know. Mike you behind most violence and instigation you'll find atheist who would sometime claim that they follow a certain religion As a christian, cool i respect your religion of no religion. Ew Religious riots like this just continue to fuel my atheism. I sometimes feel this entire world is simulation.  

Check the digital world , we all are communicating in digital form , not physical.  


So what's before physical form? 

Spiritual form maybe just my guess . well, bro fuck atheist China and North Korea too. (i mean mao kill count is higher than Ashoka Hindu ruler with maximum kill count).

also, our sun may not go supernova (and become white dwarf).   I believe people should follow a religion but not let it define it as what they are. Zzzzzz boring rehashed opinion. People have been saying this forever, it's not revolutionary, just a boring old take. Get some new material. Religion only reflects the true nature of most humans .....weak and gullible....unable to accept death, or for others, life itself..as stupid as it sounds. ""Which is more likely: that all natural order is suspended, or that a Jewish minx should tell a lie? There has to be an answer to this."" - Christopher Hitchens You sound like a fundamentalist. preach my brother *Sorts by controversial* Preach So you believe a world without religion would be better? What you wrote gives a sense of misinformation. Maybe you're too young to know. 


Anyway, religion itself is a non-issue, humans themselves are vile and exclusive. If you think atheism would solve anything, you're wrong. Look at China, they are atheists. 


Many of the idiotic things that we do are driven by religion but if religion were to cease existing, we will latch onto something else. 


Religion isn't the problem it has never been. Extremism is the problem. People reach these extreme conclusions without proper research or thought process. Facts Sounds like OP is about to lead the atheist religion against all other religions in an non-holy war. How bout people just believe what they want and everyone stops trying to tell/force others what to believe. You sound like someone told you something that you don’t like 😬😂 Religion should never have had ties with worldly powers but in the course of time, it has. In my view, power bestowed to man must not be muddled with religious beliefs. 

Religion got its bad reputation because of the dominance of religious men in power over the masses. 

It doesn't matter what religion you are, if you are trying to tie in power with your beliefs then you're most likely not doing it right. >""Reflect that the dead suffer no evils, that all those stories which make  us dread the nether world are mere fables, that he who dies need fear  no darkness, no prison, no blazing streams of fire, no river of Lethe,  no judgment seat before which he must appear, and that Death is such  utter freedom that he need fear no more despots. All that is a phantasy  of the poets, who have terrified us without a cause. Death is a release  from and an end of all pains: beyond it our sufferings cannot extend: it  restores us to the peaceful rest in which we lay before we were born. ""

\- Seneca, Consolation of Marcia

[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Of\_Consolation:\_To\_Marcia](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Of_Consolation:_To_Marcia) Reading this makes me wonder how even more fucked up an atheist country the size of India would be. [deleted] Religion by itself is not a problem but religious extremism or any kind of extremism for that matter is. 

Similar to capitalism is not bad but crony capitalism is or socialism is not bad but communist dictatorship is or Patriotism is not bad but nationalism is. Currently reading remembrance of earth's past trilogy. It really seems that we need trisolaris level threat and the proof of existence of a dark forest to finally unite as humans and forget all religions. My man :) Well you are close but forgot one thing, fuck humanity. There is no need to do this bs of making world a better place or whatever that means. This earth, science, climate change and all doesn’t really matter. It is a just biological instinct to think we need to save our species, progress and other bs, overall nothing really matters (atleast there is no evidence it does). Humans have propagated this idea that human life is valuable, we should continue reproducing and then try to keep creating societal and economic structures to live comfortably for no reason whatsoever. What about Pascal’s Wager?

https://youtu.be/BlfX9LNrl6E You can't say 💯 percent surely that God doesn't exist..the probability isn't 0 after all.. Faith is not bad. Religion/institution is Just maybe fuck all religion is not the answer? Be an atheist, believe in a God, whatever makes you happy. But be a good human being first. Do no harm as stated by OP. 

The problem with attacking religion so blatantly is that most of the world still believes in something. This is bound to change over time but till then, we can't just say fuck religion and all our problems will be solved. So...ok. What about spirituality? You don't know for sure that everything goes black and we cease to exist. I'm not defending a belief in the afterlife at all, just stating a fact. I had the same feelings as you at one point, I still struggle with it tbh. Yes there has been a lot of blood spilled over religions, but there has also been a lot of good things that came from it as well. A good moral code for ppl at the least. I have my doubts about religion but spirituality is a different thing all together. You are judging this life on tangible things in a world we still don't fully understand. Religion could have helped those sheep herders thousands of years ago to fill the gaps of what they don't understand and as far as we have come since then, there is still so much to be explained through science. No one on this plane of existence right now knows what happens for sure after death. Why be another one that says they know what does or doesn't happen then? That's a little hypocritical. One of those gaps in what we understand could explain what will happen to us spirituality (not religiously)  after what we think is life in this reality is over. I don't think there are definite answers to it, so no one can truly say we go here or there or we cease to be. I notice you left out Scientology. Interesting.  hes a little confused but hes got the spirit You bealive in a lot of nonsense why I can't bealive in God. Actually some of the mass genocide weren't made cuz religion. Socialism have killed more people in the last century. If fuck all religion, then what is the purpose of life?

Why do religigion keep appearing?

Why when people are helpless they’re looking for some being to help them? If you are thinking religion is the root cause for all kind of wars you are WRONG. 

Humans are chaotic in nature just like animals. Humans shed blood even before religion exists. Its just our sixth sense stopping us to do so but its still uncontrollable, in the end human love to war, love to slave others, love to destroy others not belong to their group/race/religion/country/continent/language/direction etc etc etc. all these are just a reason for war, if there is no religion am pretty much sure humans will kill each other for whatever the other reason they can think off. 

In the end it doesn’t matter, who are all died are going to get replaced by new births, its not like humans are going to get extinct, i only see it as a way of population control.

If you are smart enough... like me...
Let them fight and kill each other.
Dont get emotional, dont pick side and ioin the war. Just watch them kill each other. Enjoy this quote will you now 

“The more I read, the more puzzled I was by the order of the universe and the disorder of the human mind, by the scientists who didn’t agree on the how, the when, or the why of creation.

Then one day this student brought me Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason. Reading Kant, I began to suspect everything I was taught. I no longer believed in the known God of the Bible, but rather in the mysterious God expressed in nature.

The basic laws of the universe are simple, but because our senses are limited, we can’t grasp them. There is a pattern in creation.

If we look at this tree outside whose roots search beneath the pavement for water, or a flower which sends its sweet smell to the pollinating bees, or even our own selves and the inner forces that drive us to act, we can see that we all dance to a mysterious tune, and the piper who plays this melody from an inscrutable distance—whatever name we give to it —Creative Force, or God—escapes all book knowledge.

Science is never finished because the human mind only uses a small portion of its capacity, and man’s exploration of his world is also limited.

Creation may be spiritual in origin, but that doesn’t mean that everything created is spiritual. How can I explain such things to you? Let us accept the world is a mystery. Nature is neither solely material nor entirely spiritual.

If we want to improve the world we cannot do it with scientific knowledge but with ideals. Confucius, Buddha, Jesus and Gandhi have done more for humanity than science has done.
We must begin with the heart of man—with his conscience—and the values of conscience can only be manifested by selfless service to mankind.

Religion and science go together. As I’ve said before, science without religion is lame and religion without science is blind. They are interdependent and have a common goal—the search for truth.

Hence it is absurd for religion to proscribe Galileo or Darwin or other scientists. And it is equally absurd when scientists say that there is no God. The real scientist has faith, which does not mean that he must subscribe to a creed.""

Science is just as valuable as the non plagiarised scripture is.... to know what is plagiarised what can be trusted as raw knowledge is Upto you , you will find the further you go back the more genuine it gets , if you are not savvy enough to separate the gold from the shit then that’s your problem not mine.. 

Look mate for a start you can’t have much of an idea about the nature of ancient scripture for claiming Buddhism a religion like Islam or orthodox fundamentalism that we see saturating the globe now be alike , I see Tibetan teaching as sacred sciences as do I knowledge of the Jains and Vedic roots in general , just a different perception of ultimately the same things that is of the flip side to the coin - still the same coin though  , how many words I can turn atom into something that’s related to the Vedas like Atman , many examples alike... 

I don’t let religious fundamentalism ruin what was once and still is known , raw knowledge  ; it’s both on a physical and metaphysical level , I relate most of what Vedic teaches to quantum mechanics for example... ""The more I read, the more puzzled I was by the order of the universe and the disorder of the human mind, by the scientists who didn’t agree on the how, the when, or the why of creation.

Two sides of the same coin , each making up eachother 

“The rishis tell us of the galactic center of the universe, which feeds energy to all the galaxies and solar systems of the universe. A modern discovery is beginning to reinforce this belief. To explore this three centers must be identified, 1) the center of a solar system (Sun), 2) The center of a galaxy, 3) the galactic center of the universe. Our focus here will be on the first two centers. In exploring these two centers we will discover the current Hindu principles of Brahma, Shiva and Vishnu at work. Those these same principles can be explored using the galactic center of the universe also.” https://www.boloji.com/articles/1490/modern-black-hole-theory

Doesn’t sound much like a religion to me does Hindu and Jain , Buddhism more like sacred sciences that offers a deferent view point on the same questions , real science does have some sort of faith ....

 I just think you are terribly mislead and have let religious fundamentalism turn you into abit of a hard headed nob head to tar them all off under the same brush like that is one of the most ignorant of things going and ultimately it is you that looses out this man said fuck christian😭😭 who the fuck is christian This comment section is proof that regardless of religion existing or not, humans will still eat the heads off each other over misplaced self righteousness. TL, DR Thing is Sikhism is amazing. It just teaches you how to be the strongest version of yourself. Women are queens Men are Kings. Sikhs have been screwed so many times because it’s just a religion that makes you a successful and strong person. Others religions don’t want it to rise. Sikhs don’t attack first there has to be a BIG reason for them to attack. They mostly defend. beautiful wording but shit man, I don’t want to die staring at the dark abyss for eternity, and for that reason i’m out... What problem you have with Buddhism, bro ?
I know it's your fraustration speaking but just tell me cons of Buddhism, I might get your facts about Buddhism corrected.
Peace. How is this related to India Life never dies on earth 
It reproduces itself
Which is why humans crave for sex so much. [deleted] Ok one thing is not believing in religion which I also don’t , but you fucking fuck head who are you to feed people this bullshit ? I have always been against religion and all the problems it brought us , but one thing I know , and if you had hallucionogetics before you would know better , life it’s not just this , bro/sister if you are not religious it doesn’t mean you have to think that life is just this , make your own mind take your own perspective because atheist is another religion for me and another group of fuck heads trying to act like they know the truth of life lol peace I agree but i think Agnosticism  is more of the solution at least in my case because I do believe in God but that nigga don't give a fuck fr so... and we don't understand that meaning in itself so religion makes not sense cause you cant tell anybody shit about God cause we all know the same amount . P.S. In DBZ King Kai is a God and that nigga lets people die on the daily so it makes no sense to the they care. And i speak about caring cause we are selfish beings so if someone don't care about us we no care bout dem. I bet you think you're a genius for writing this. Like really, what a revelation you are bringing us here I am Christian and I used to believe in the same thing as you, but one thing got in my way:

If we die and that's it, were dead how do we remember now? It's hard to even wrap my own head around, but hear me out, if we just die and that's it how can I remember this moment right now? 

Honestly just a question, not a statement. NOT RECOMMENDED 

Most atheistic society like soviet union who were anti religion as marx said ""reliong is opioid for masses""
KILLED 40-60 MILLION mostly by fast track courts, starvation. 

NAZI's absolutely hated orthodox narratives and set out to eradicate suffering endedup killing 40-50 MILLION. Lol I really disagree with the ‘supernova’ part of your comment. The fate of our sun is to become a red dwarf, its not big enough to supernova. The rest seems reasonable. My religion is rajma chawal. It is totally okay if you don't believe in god but why do you have to talk bad about religions just because you don't believe in it. Religion means to everyone something else and thats completely fine. I just don’t understand why people can’t accept that there are people who believe in God or believe in nothing. Religion is not only about what happens after your death it’s also about many other things. If you are born, for example in a muslim family you don’t have to be a muslim you can just convert to an other religion or believe in nothing. I just don’t get it why you have to hate or judge people who are religious or believe in nothing you should just accept them. My dad grew up in a very religious household and was very religious himself. But as he got older, moved out and got married he started to lose his belief, so it is possible to change one’s belief. I am an atheist/agnostic, I don’t believe in God (a agnostic doesn’t normally cut out the possibility of there being one God or multiple God’s but I personally don’t believe in God) but I think that there could be something after death. I believe in what I can see or in what is already proven by science. Still I think all religions deserve the get accepted and respected. I still don’t get why people hate and judge others by their religion or/and belief. I am very nearly one hundred percent behind you only there is this tiny little voice that whispers that bit from the Bible "" the fool sayeth in his heart there is no God"" but organised religion? not worth a damn Why can't you allow people to have their own beliefs. Why be a cunt so if i say anything about my religion im pushing to down peoples throats, BUT when atheist come here and say no religion is true because of science its not considered pushing your beliefs down my throat?? thats just hypocrisy. Relax dude. Religion is a belief I have no problem with that but saying that I should believe in it too and forcing the principles of religion on us is so fkin annoying While I am a strict atheist, I still wonder if religion is necessary for society or not? A religion does not always fucks up everyone, at its core it teaches moral code. Why do people pay beggars? Do they not feel morally obliged? Religion even creates jobs. Tourism is the main industry here. A religion also is a great tool to keep the masses in checks. How many politicians make religion their chief propaganda? India has a population of 1.3+ billion. But since the majority here believes in religion, there is a sincere moral code that is followed here even by those in the lowest ranks of society. And their reason is ""god will not forgive us otherwise"". 

Thus I think that religion need reformation and modernization more so. 
The main thing that religions need is to burn their texts. Those unscientific teachings completely make every follower irrational. Then it needs to purge the ""dhongis"". There are some very genuine religious heads who teach the right conduct instead of their donation account numbers. And stop mixing politics with religion. That is the worst thing that can happen. Religion is bad in many ways because political leaders will go to any lengths to appease people. 

And frankly, somehow people are always more eager to listen to all irrational things in religions. Remember those glorious tales of Ramayana and Mahabharta. People want to listen to those because it helps them escape reality. 

""People believe people but not necessarily ideals or institutions.""
             ~Yang Wen-Li

Therefore religions are inevitable. But genuine leaders can make religions good. The masses do not believe facts, they believe what they want to believe. The only thing missing is the scientific revolution only began ~500 years ago...which means there is no science *in* those archaic (and current) texts. 
No mention of all that we can see of our universe. You lost me at ""have faith in people"" [deleted] Only in INDIA Money is also evil. Its actually the root of all evil. It power all politician and religious groups, money also divides us. FUCK MONEY I'm open to criticism on this. However,

Religion has brought us nothing but hardship and mass murder? I agree thoroughly with a lot of the points you have made (obviously quite passionately), however to sum up the net worth of religion in society as '' mass murder and hardship'' is quite juvenile and quite frankly, false. Science and Religion are separate facets in social lives that are personal to each individual. All major world religions base their beliefs on pre existing human morals and either give them a narrative or an incentive to uphold traditional moral values. I personally believe a breakdown in faith and lack of belief in the preexisting religious moral institution led to the rise of Nazism in Germany in the 1930s and look where that left us.

'' Leave your religion'' - I genuinely hope that was passionate rhetoric rather than what you truly believe. Any anti-freedom of religion country would be morally bankrupt. Freedom of expression and freedom of speech are essential to any working democracy. The same passionate rhetoric in reverse would be condemned by the media as crude conversion tactics. 

Obviously the government should be secular and religion should never be checked in government forms nor in college applications. 

I've definetly pissed off a few people. But rather than shouting slogans and holding a pseudo-moralistic stance, what we need in genuine discourse. You'll start believing them once you experience real paranormal things. ;) Spirits/Souls are true. As a Canadian, I feel that you have a right to your opinion but you shouldn't be criticising people for believing something you don't agree on.

Who cares if this person believes one thing? Accept your differences and move on. 

At the end of the day, we're all human. Don't judge by belief. Hmmm When you say there is evil in this world, you assume there's good. By what standard do you different between good and evil? If we're just matter, there is no evil, there is no good. To have an objective moral law, there should be a Moral law giver. Let me just start off by saying that humans are always looking for idols. This idol has to be a representation of a person. It can be a politician, a teacher, or anything. Indian teens often look at Bollywood celebrities and cricketers as their idols. Therefore, it's a human tendency to look out for idols. However, all these idols are human. When these humans make mistakes, their hard-earned idol breaks. In this comparison to this human idol, the idols of God are the best alternative. They represent perfection, and they can never break. This is because Gods are believed to never make mistakes and always provide the best path in life. That's why people so blindly believe in them.

Now that clear, I wanna say that if you want to break religion today, then it's possible. You can truly break these idols. However, I can guarantee you that there will be something that will pop up in the next 100-500 years. It doesn't have to be mainstream religion like today. Science can turn out to be a religion possibly when we discover some fundamental truth, and we can become so arrogant that we will forget to look at other perspectives except the laws of physics. 

The reason for this permanent existence of religion is not the blind faith of people but the source of order in our society. In the 12 Rules For Life by Jordan Peterson, Peterson brings a compelling argument that in our world, and possibly the universe, there are forms of **order** and **disorder**.  This is the true meaning of the Chinese philosophical concept of Yin and Yang. The popular symbol of the two white and black fishes. The white represents order, hierarchy, cultures, discipline, faith, traditions while the black represents disorder: freedom, innovation, creativity, disorder, chaos, unpredictability, no-rules. What's so interesting is that you can see this duality around you. I definitely recommend you all to read this book. Note that both sides of the model have positive and negative impacts.  So basically, an ideal society is one that has a balance of both. But historically this hasn't been so. You will observe the whole human race making radical shifts from one state to another. When there are too many wars and there is no morality in people, then a new religion arises and attempts to create peace by asserting codes by which people can adhere to. This is a shift towards order. However, with time, the rules only grow and become overpowering to an extent that the religion may appear as oppression or tyranny. Then our society has a rebel who rallies and breaks the religion restoring freedom and free speech. To do this the rebel takes away all the existing rules. But then after some time, with this new freedom, people lose their moral codes.  They take advantage of this freedom and our whole free society turns out to be a blunder. 

The point is that religion or anything in the world is not good or bad. In my perspective, if you promote hate against religion, then there is no difference between you and those religious people who convey the same feelings against atheists and heathens. You are equally as ignorant as them. 

I completely agree that under religion, so many innocents had to suffer. However, I believe that is not true religion. Religion today has become a tool for politicians to sway public support, at least in India. There are riots, arsons, violent crimes, rapes, torture, and so many atrocities committed to defending religion. There are also these so-called spiritual babas that teach ways of ignorance and bigotry.

The problem arises because people feel that religion is told to them. To me, no Godamn retard can tell me what to do, what my religion is! Religious knowledge or spiritual knowledge actually arises from within. You have to sense your soul yourself. A guru only helps you in recognizing yourself. A soul and consciousness may be meaningless to you, and I respect the opinion. To me, the exploration of this soul is aesthetic and worth it.

I believe I'm a religious person. I'm a Hindu. Yet my religion or my own taking of it doesn't force me to hate other religions. Rather I'm quite fascinated by Sufism, and it's my dream to go to the Nizamuddin Dargah. Religion does not make me feel that I matter or that God will come and help me from my misery. While being religious, I just admire the beauty of the world. This is my opinion on it. You can have a different one, and I will respect it. Although, religion is what got us here. To civilization. Whether it is useful now or not is a matter of debate, but humans being the dominant species on the planet is largely a contribution of religion. Religion and spirituality are different. Religion can be more elaborately defined as a way of living or what we call in Sanskrit as 'Dharma'. But most times we forget that if religions did not exist, we would not be where we are now. Religion has played a great role in the development of human civilisation. If one doesn't believe in god, that doesn't mean they should criticize religion. 

We turned religion and culture into communalism. That wasn't the true aim. Lol, did you notice how sure you are off your theory. Everything blacks out.

Do you know that you don't know a lot about yourself and this world.

What caused the big bang, how did life originate, what is conciousness,why are you concious of this expirience. 

That's the problem with atheists,you do not like any religion you just jump to conclusions like others did.

Scientists themselves say that they do not know a lot of the universe and it's still very much mysterious. I think there is truth in all of it :)

And you bet your bottom dollar that the people who run the world believe in religion , very very strictly!

But

There must be something more, evil vs good, dark vs light, hero vs villian you can see this with your own eyes and you can feel it in your guts!

In order for there to be light there must be darkness and in order for darkness there must be light ! It's essentially about being prayerful, that's why you can worship anyone & anything in India cuz it's about our well being. God is just a tool. You should fuck whoever you can wherever you can whenever you can, don't qoute me on tha. u/uwutranslator That might be true might not be true but 
Religion is a string of hope to hold in to when things get tough and worse. It is just hope. something good to think of when things are bad.Kl [removed] Relevant - https://i.imgur.com/B3AC3bv.jpg I too was 13 once Wow this has gotta be dumbest shit i have seen this month or something Cringe This is a stupidly non-informed post. Anything not explainable with logic.....bam happy tripping [removed] I like this guy. Someone's watching Crash Course Philosophy. Aren’t you becoming the very thing you hate by disregarding what others believe and forcing them to follow your path.

Don’t get me wrong, I know your feeling and like the base idea about achieving a better humanity and way of life by self and mutual contribution.

Wouldn’t the better message be “Jio Aur Jeene Do” why bother what others believe or does as long as they contribute to the betterment of the society.

Everyone wants to vent after what’s happening/ has been happening in our country. I love you for having balls to say this straight. Why all the hate on religion? This is something I don't understand. I was raised in a very religious family (LDS). I don't believe it's true, I don't believe in any religion, but what are they really teaching you? aside from the fucked up history, it's only saying be nice, don't kill people. Honestly, please tell me why you hate it so much? If you say it caused wars, bull shit, men cause wars and use religion as an excuse(BTW, if religion wasn't there we'd still have wars). I'm not on religion's side but hate is the real problem with religion. People hating others due to their religious beliefs is the real problem. YOU are the problem, not religion. Stop the hate and embrace the good principals they teach. I don't see any problem with religious people as long as they don't affect other people in a negative way. We don't know the cause of consciousness and you have no basis to claim the only thing that happens after death is your body decaying. Oblivion might be your belief but shoving it down everyone's throat is your fallacy. We don't know a lot about a lot of things and dismissing age old wisdom is not always the answer. You sound a lot like an edgy kid. Staunch atheism and 'rationalism' isn't the only way to go. There's a lot wrong with a lot of religions but their main shortcoming is the believers thinking this is the one and only way to do things, and ironically you share this trait. Another person talking about something they never bothered to study.  And many people agreeing who also never studied the subject.  Lots of retards on both sides of the fence Lol, OP, does creativity need to abide by logic for you be benefited? If you can't see past the literal to uncover the absurd truth about this existence, then what are you doing criticizing religion? The self righteous woke-ness is strong in this thread Nothing divides us except religion? What a farce. this isn't facebook, go jerk yourself off somewhere else. Wow.  This is the best they could do after reports of anti-Muslim lynchings. No post about human rights just a post about religion being evil. Maybe not kill your minorities first. No offense this is how it starts. the rage. the feeling of powerlessness, that turns good men cruel. when you question one's faith. 

you're no different than the people you oppose.

all people are dumb, it's the universal truth. be it anyone, believer or a non believer I'm not a religious but I pity you for your onedimensional view o religion as a whole.

Tbh you seem like a guy who never educated himself in any religion.
I know the situation in your country is bad but condemning every religion just because of that is wrong man. Religion isn't responsible. It's the people that want their religion to be the best, the only religion. People suck, not religion in itself.

and FYI: Stop calling youself atheists when you are not educated in religion. YES. god damn right! Honestly fuck everyone that's not me. Poor guy got rejected at a Baptist single mingle. Edge Super edgy You’re confused. You described religion the way a child would. It’s not about following certain rules and making sure everyone else does the same. It’s more about community and spreading love. Just because you’re exposed to the violence that is brought about by extremists, doesn’t mean the entire idea itself follows the same mentality. 

Also, who are you to explain what happens after death? Last time I checked, none of us have a clue. So I agree that we should live in the moment and cherish it, because it’s all we have. Just admit that you know just as much as the religious,  because otherwise you’re lying to yourself Lmao losers like this actually exist.

E N L I G H T E N E D. I am not saying that god is real or anything but there are so many things that are unexplained. Like why space exists in the first place, stuff like that. So may be there is a 'being' out there or may be there isn't who is responsible for our creation. They could be some higher dimensional being or whatever. But at the very least they are not bothered enough to make contact with us or may be they don't even exist anymore. Whatever the case may be, to glorify them saying they have a 'plan' for all of us is stupid. People make excuses in the name of religion just to define their own hatred and heinous acts.   


Religion is nothing more but an excuse. Going to need less edge on this post. You are all dumb. I would suggest you to do some thoughtful reading before acting as if you know everything. The book is Homo sapiens a history of us. I partly agree, but religion is probably the reason why the world is as it is now. Religion is what United people, made them work together, think together. All ancient empires/countries/civilizations had religion as their cornerstones, and this allowed people to work and build and think in unity. Read the book Sapiens by Yuval Harari, it's a very good book and explains this in deeper depth.
  Edit: its also the reason the government exists An observation, I've never heard a thiest talk like this. It looks like most religious people tend to be pretty happy and here you are pissed at everything.

If believing in ""stories"" has made them happy and you angry, they reap the benefits of a happy life and you get to whine on the internet. If you only get about 80 years of existence, seems like you're spending a lot of time being pissed. Calm down pajeet This is a really passionate anecdotal that immediately loses the idea of what religion is supposed to be. Death to religion! Sir, this is a Wendy's Love this post. Have been wanting to post something of this sort for the longest time, I’m glad someone did. 
Fuck religion. Religion is one of the main reasons the world is going to shit. Ok edgelord if you want to be down with bad boy, then fuck you too 12 years old is a wild time buddy. Hang in there. sounds like it was written by an edgy 12 year old Cringe

Indias problems are because of indians God damn this OP is just a tunnel visioned fuck talking about ""open your mind"". Religion is a set of principles, the adaptation and interpretation by said sick religious fucks is the problem. Humans are the problem. OP, by creating this post, you are the problem because you're having to voice a disdain for religious people, just to be a judgmental POS. You too, do not know the answer to anything, so please, stfu and keep your opinions to yourself. I do not believe in your god ""non existant"" god or the next persons ""existing"" god, but you dont have a right to say there is no god. That is quite literally an uneducated statement. You're sitting there saying ""there is no god how can you be so stupid, you dont know anything!"" while you look like the complete ass due to not knowing universal answers to anything as well. Its just your sad shitty pessimistic outlook on your meaningless life. Oh well, cya. You’re not just wrong, you’re retarded I’m trying to figure out where I asked for your opinion You said Hinduism. So, I will write about Hinduism, nothing else. I think you have a very superficial understanding of Hinduism as a religion. I agree with your rant that all religions have done till now is creating rift and disruption amongst the people of the world. But, that's just a commentary on the aspect of religion followed by the majority of the population and not religion in itself. 

Religion is not going to temples, not eating beef, reciting mantras, singing hymns, making ashrams, subscribing to gurus and holier than thou attitude. Religion is more than that. There's a beauty to it. The philosophies proposed in Hindu scriptures are mesmerizing and intellectually stimulating. The simple rituals prescribed by the scriptures are nourishing to the mind and body. These are some of the beautiful aspects of religion. It's not degrading, discriminatory or condescending towards anyone. Following the crux of a religion requires no violence or any untoward activity. The philosophies outlined in religion basically provides tools and capabilities for better introspection into our existence.

The question of how and why we are here is the essence of all scientific pursuits. Religion/spirituality is just another way to approach the problem. Thousands of years of spiritual research and development has provided us with tools to understand life a little better. This is an alternative to the approach of going with a blank slate or not thinking about it altogether. It's like scientific research, where the knowledge from the past researcher helps to develop our own theories and understanding about a phenomenon. That's what Hindu religion is supposed to mean, at least to me.

I am a proud Hindu. I will always be. To me Hinduism doesn't mean heavens, Gods, Godesses, temples or prayers. I am in love with the philosophical nuances of the religion. That stimulates my scientific mind and helps me become a better human being. That's my opinion. How ignorant and ironic. Fool Making a Reddit post saying ""fuck you"" a lot and telling people they're an idiot for being religious isn't going to change anyone's mind. You're not the first person to do this and won't be the last. 

Are we really going to tolerate such broad generalizations? I'm not one for religion either but seriously. Religion is not the only thing dividing us. Tribalism will always exist, religion or no.

If someone made a post going ""fuck all gays,"" then they would be downvoted to hell, and for good reason. 

So why is it good for someone to do the same to another large group of people, most of which are ordinary human beings? You might be right and you might be wrong but one thing is for sure, you’re a dick. Isn't *that* a great way to win allies and convert others.

""Share my belief set or Fuck Off.""

Sounds almost- I dunno, religious or something. this site has such a hate boner for religion its actually cringe Wow man you're so smart you've figured it all out by yourself. 5000 years of debating on the existance of the lord and you pking3, obviously the smartest and wisest being in the universe, have found the definite answer in your very insightful fuck all religion post.

Thank you and fuck you in the ass for being an absolute teenage retard. I hope after life is real, so I can shit in your fucking mouth for all eternity. You're right: religion has created tremendous hatred and division. It has caused a lot of death and pain. It is also one of the largest contributors to charity of all kinds worldwide, and one of the greatest sources of compassion for people whom society leaves behind. Whether someone who believes in a religion is childish is an individual issue; there is no rule.

But you know what is always childish? Saying, as you're for all intents and purposes saying here, that in spite of physicists', chemists', mathematicians', and biologists' inability to describe the exact workings of an incredibly complex universe as ours, you alone, one person, understand the exact metaphysical function of life and death. Not only that, but you're so convicted of your unproven premise that you're bombastically contemptuous of anyone who disagrees. 

You sound like a 13 year old who just encountered Richard Dawkins for the first time and wants to be edgy. Sit down. ""Open your mind"", ""religion is the source of hate."" In a post filled with vitriolic language and hatred towards large groups of people.  Sucks to break it to you, but hatred is a part of all human experience, not just religious people and your post is evidence of that. I don’t think saying “fuck all your religions” unites anyone, but ok. Me sO eDgY aNd sMaRT cAuSe mE nO bEliEve sKy DaDdY TIL india has teen edge lords too! Glad that you have it all figured out. That sure is a long winded and overly emotional way to say that nobody matters. So why waste your timing screaming into the universe that doesnt give a crap about how you feel or your views.... Your insignificant, what you think doesnt mean anything. God still loves you though, and we all pray for a change in your blasphemous heart. Because at the end of days is the worst way to find out that all this time you where wrong your whole life, and eternity is a sure long time to burn in hell over an idiotic opinion. I agree misinterpretations of Religion can cause violence , yes it has been used by some to control 
The masses .

However saying that there is no creator ... it’s all physics and science .... is pure bull shit .

We barely know the workings of quantum mechanics , we barely know what relativity is , we barely even know the universe , there are a lot of answers that we don’t have .

There could be a creator , we don’t know what form , it could be a civilisation or a spirit or light . We don’t know 

You just can’t say there isn’t a creator , you could instead say we don’t knowwwww if there is one Did you just turn 13? And who the fuck are you to judge what the rest of the world believes in!! Evidently your the one who is dumber than a box of rocks!! Fuck you. Your a piece of garbage I usually just keep my mouth shut and move on on posts like this because it's obvious that this person has no intention of a discussion they just want to state their belief. I am seriously tired of people like this though. No i'm not talking about people bashing religion, you do you, i'm talking about people who are either slightly smarter than the average person or who found a idea thought of by someone smarter than them running around stating their theories as facts because they have been able to shut down arguments brought to them by people who have not put any major thought into it. Y'all are the reason intellectualism has a stigma.
On top of that the whole reason for ""fuck religion"" is the same argument as blaming a weapon for a murder. People are bad, they do bad things and if you remove the tools they are using to do bad things they will just find new ways. Xenophobia hasn't even been solely acted on because of religion, religions just tend to be the largest cultural groups so attacks between them generally have a greater impact. [removed] Who hurt you, OP? Buddhism isn't a religion. Is science your new religion? [deleted] [removed] If you're truly an atheist, a true atheist in word, thought and acts, then for you there should be no concern at all. Because as per your ideology no one has any choice in any matter as the laws of physics and chemistry coupled with the initial conditions of the Big Bang force people to behave exactly as they do. 

Hence, if you inspite of adhering to this ideology try to comment here, fully aware that everyone is genetically determined, so no one should convince anyone, as freewill is non-existent, and hence getting offended or hurt or disagreement are just illusions of a random oscillation. 

Further, if someone wants to blame God, then first accept the existence of God. Don't put blame on someone that as per them doesn't even exist, cause then they're just an emotionally induced atheist, with their roots in emotion not logic, creating principles of evil or good when such principles don't exist in nature. 

If however, you first accept God and hence you want to blame him then you should ask the question - Why should people not suffer, including a child, a seemingly helpless animal or any other. Why is it that they shouldn't suffer? When the question of evil arises, the actual subliminal question that people ask is - ""Why isn't God behaving as per my desire?"" I want to live forever he makes me die, I want unlimited sex, he creates obstacles, I want unlimited tasty treats, he creates fat, diabetes, I want unlimited intoxication he creates drug trauma, whatever I want to do, he creates problems? Why? It's because a compassionate father not only treats but punishes when you do wrong. And the wrong is not just for one birth, but cyclical, and accumulative, when you keep ignoring it, it grows and one day it just bursts. When the worm is eaten by a cat, then one may think the worm suffered, but scriptually the jeeva soul in that worm got trasmuted into a sperm and then born as a kitten, and so on the cycle continues. 

The desire of fools is material pleasure without any sort of disturbance. Disturbance in enjoying such insignificant pleasure is what is regarded as evil by fools. Death, murder, destruction, disease, and suffering of all kinds is the actual evil and all these evils are sent accordingly by God as per your degree of attachment to such material pleasures. The law of karma works in this way - suppose as per some past act you have to die through a head wound, that karma will make someone who wants to beat someone, who has the desire to beat someone, like a gangster come to you, or you go the gangster, the gangster will beat on the head, and then in the future he too will suffer for murdering someone. In this way one being's desire of beating someone and another's beings deservement both are carried out simultaneously. God will fulfill your desire, no matter how evil it is, one day it shall come to pass, in this life or another, but so will it's consequences. Giving up desires or kaama is the basis of liberation or moksha. Kaliyuga is that age when the pending evil desires of beings is heavily unleashed. It's not God making them behave in this fashion, they want to do it themselves. They like killing babies, they like blowing things up, they like raping and looting, and killing the masses, carving their flesh and drinking till they're dead, and birth after birth they keep suffering. 

Out of all the wars, murders, crimes almost all of them have one or more of these 3 motives - 
Lust, Anger or Greed, all of which are categorically curbed in any bonafide religion. 

Holocaust, Holodomor, The Cambodian genocide of 1975, The Armenian Genocide of 1915, the Zunghar genocide etc. which killed 7 times more people than the two world wars combined have been done by the irreligious. You're doing the same thing which you accuse religion of - Collective hate. 

As for the OP, I'm not here to convince anyone, but to say that please behave as per the ultimate conclusions of your own ideology, which is Atheism here, like a random oscillation with no friends or enemies, with no concept of good or evil, as such concepts are imaginary as per the same logic applied. Please practice such atheism ardently. Also, yeah I post at a sub that many people here are averse to, and yeah its because atleast I can say my say over there. Thank You. These kind of liberals are a threat to society. Who just call out and say everyone is equal culprit and don't take a side. These are the liberals who will send an apology after a pogrom and genocide is done. These are the one that give intellectual validation to the extreme right wing. Under the soviet and communists who are majority atheists we have seen far more genocides and these people have hidden. it very well from rest of the world. China Russia have killed more people in the name of religion

Randia loves these liberals who just wants to put us into the same mess. Will no religion change things for India? Definitely no.

Indias problem lies in casteism. Even if you are a atheist you will continue to look down on people who don't follow your ideas or belief. There are atheists in developed countries but there thinking will never match the Indian casteist thinking. Because in European countries a person can work hard defy his status. But in a casteist society people will always find a way to keep there superiority. You a don't have money but you have caste this makes you superior because you are born with the caste. This gives you reason to look down on those who have money and also those who don't have money.

This casteist mentality should go. Today the mentality is to look down at Muslims as the lowest amongst the society. Very soon this will come to haunt you liberals as well. I believe it's the lack of knowledge about a religion not the religion itself which has divided humanity. from what i believe  religion actually tells you how to actually be a good person

for example: respecting your elders ,teachers,your loved ones.

well according to the bhagavad gita krishna is the universe and when krishna gave the divine eyes to arjuna .what he observed that there were infinite forms of krishna indicating that the universe is expanding ( which is true according to the astronomer edwin hubble).

now in terms of living in the society; Religion also tells about different characteristics of a human being-

1. mode of goodness
2. mode of passion

3 mode of ignorance

now following religion also gives you inner piece (eg; chanting ""ohm"" brings inner piece in yourself   and makes you feel more connected and relaxed).

you would actually understand this when you through some books about religion

but yea there are some negative aspects too and i am totally against that (eg: committing fraud and making money through religion). Saying 'Fuck all religion' on Reddit is like saying 'Nazis suck' to a Jew ( or well, anyone with a brain because Nazis do suck, period.)

But you get my point. It's basically preaching to the choir.

Personally, I am spiritual. Not sure if religious but definitely spiritual. I have seen the capacity of religion and spirituality to do good. Yes, a lot of people-in-power use it for their own personal ends and many corrupt their original teachings but that doesn't negate the numerous truly good religious people in the world.

Faith is a fickle thing. It truly gives some people purpose. And I'm not referring to the ones who corrupt it and use it for violence, no. I'm talking about normal, everyday people who wish to go about their lives being decent human beings.

No religion, by itself, promotes violence, murder or hurting your fellow man ( as far as I am aware). It's a tool that was intended to keep people from turning bad. And tools can be used for both good and bad.

Saying 'Fuck all Religion' is easy to say to an Atheist-majority community. The same way it's easy to say 'Fuck all Hindus' to a group of Islamic extremists or 'Fuck all Muslim' to a group og Hindutva extremists. It's just a different form of hate.

What is hard is actually looking into what various religions offer people and why they resonate with people the way they do and maybe then enter into discourse and understanding. I know u r saying this as u r watching what's happening in our country. When it comes to religion, people of power deceive and manipulate the general public to continue enjoying power. Look at the positive side of religion. I was brought up in a family where my parents r atheists and follow Marxism (As Marx said Religion is the opium of the masses; I agree with the statement) but I became a theist.
Every religion is based on some common values giving up materialism, power, greed and rest everyone knows.
Religion may play a big role in the current conditions of our country but u know anyone who truly understands any religion will give up their worldly lives. There r many cases in atheists have been the cause of genocide, take examples of Lenin and Mao. This is not a matter of religion, religion is just instrumental and a tool for these political goons to unite muscle power towards other particular minorities.
If there is no religion and God specifically we r left behind with the Existential question why r we here?, and any sane mind will never believe we r random product of our universe and the universe cant come into existence from nothing. I have studied years of science and philosophy.

Ultimately if there is no God our existence is meaningless and everything we do is meaningless and the Greatest of humans who gave lives for our country all r meaningless (and I don't think u think so). 
Therefore don't look at the surface and judge things go deeper. 
As Einstein said ""Atoms r easier to break than Prejudices"".

Another one Lol As an indian I’m surprised that India is going through this extremism. We have a booming economy and a booming middle class. That’s supposed to bring the extremism down but the opposite is happening. 

I would also like to say that while you may disagree or hate what’s happening. You have to show that disagreement with respect. Don’t abuse people’s choices and faith. Like someone smart once said. “If there wasn’t a god, we’d have to invent one.” Some people have god and nothing else. If you disagree with religion that's fine, but no need to attack religion like that. Your dumbass is like 100 years late [deleted] Only 2 religions made the chaos on this planet. Fuck Buddhism.  Buddhism is installed by chinese emperors in mongolia to control mongolian population and it did worked in 1910s 50% of mongolian mens were monk who can't marry or have sex/kids and most 50% population had HIV related disease caused by chinese merchants. To say you know nothing happens after death is just as crazy to say you know what happens. I disagree heavily. People can believe what they want to believe. My religion plays an important part in me being a better person, and so do others. We coexist, and that’s okay. Why are you being rude and disrespectful? Religion may divide but it also brings us together. For example, the DL and the pope prayed together. Religion brings peace and order, and if you don’t want to believe in it, that’s your choice. But you have no right to disrespect others for believing in it. If religions are only man made, then all of the ills that you are highlighting are likewise man made. 

It isn’t religions that are the problem, because they don’t exist without *people*. So sensitive, take the tampon out your ass No one asked. How dare you insult many people for engaging in a culture that is important to them? As a someone who studies religion I find it disgusting that you pour all this hate onto peoples heritage and cultures. 

It is true that religion can cause issues, and that some people do heinous crimes whilst claiming to be religous. But you cannot defame all religious people for the acts of the few.

There are atheists who have raped and killed but i would not say that all atheists are rapists and killers. I respect atheism just as I respect theism, you should too. No one fucking cares about your shitty opinion. Why do the atheist say “Lord have mercy” in times of distress? Hey look - someone on Reddit thinks they are smarter than almost everyone who has lived on the globe throughout history and, because it is a simplistic criticism of religion, Reddit upvotes it to the moon.

Must be Wednesday. No, you are wrong. The very action of believing something is real can make it real if you really think about it. Why do you have a problem with what is true to others and false for you? Thinking that your beliefs are true are fair but only for you. Yes there are many bad aspects to religions but they also act as great moral guidelines for people. I grew up Christian but never took anything literal like Noah’s ark. I am STILL glad for what I learned though, because it taught love a compassion towards other human beings. You aren’t wrong or right, but you cannot force you narcissistic black nothingness when you die view on others, just like they cannot force their religion on you. Agnostic here. I don't personally believe in God but I'm open to the idea that there might be something after death...unlike athiests who out right deny all religion.

There's no evidence to suggest that an afterlife exists, but there's also no evidence that it doesn't.

&#x200B;

I know plenty of people who are sick, ill, broken individuals barely keeping their lives together and the idea of an afterlife or higher presence puts them at ease. Going to church and being part of a community of people helps with their mental health and gives them the support they need sometimes. I know plenty of churches who have pastors that go out of their way to help poor families and people physically ill or hurt emotionally, suicidal folks and such. When I was a kid our house in Florida got wrecked by hurricane Andrew and the church came out and helped repaired it, even gave us food.

&#x200B;

You don't believe in God? That's fine, neither do I. However don't be an ass about it and attack people who do, it's childish and just plain discrimination. It makes you no better than a homophobe who lashes out at someone for their sexual preferences. Ok, cool. But mind your business and I'll mind mine. Thanks bro. First off you are very aggressive I can’t really even understand your point when it sounds like your yelling with how you wrote second off yes some religions aren’t helpful some are bad but then there are some that are good even if they may not be true there are other benefits to the people apart of the faith and yes maybe not all religions are without blood on their hands but that is very subjective, Christians have killed people yes but not all branches of Christianity were involved. Times are different no big religion (except Islam) seeks to kill people or hurt them there are many benefits the followers get, it gives them something to believe in and it helps them emotionally mentally and physically with that belief, maybe next time don’t be so aggressive 
(I am an orthodox Christian) Hinduism is not a religion. Its a civilization. Religion is a concept alien to India.

Civilization is something that evolves over time. Our scriptures were written by thousands of people over thousands of years. Parts of our scriptures become outdated with time and new ones were written. We accept that somethings in our scriptures were wrong. 

This means Hinduism is very robust and it is the only one to have  survived the test of time. It is cherished. You spelt steel wrong. *than Yeah fuck people that use religion to keep a positive outlook on life. Such a horrible thing.  Good thing you're on Reddit to tell everyone how bad religion is. Or were they created by nothing, or were they the creators [of themselves]? [52:35]


Or did they create the heavens and the earth? Rather, they are not certain. [52:36]


I encourage you people to read Qur'an, most of people have not read it even lot of muslims, for it is indeed from God Almighty. There were books and scriptures from God before Qur'an but they were altered and changes were made by people over time, but Qur'an is same as it was when it was revealed approximately more than 1440 years ago. May Allah guide us towards the right path. Religion is not a harmless belief, I’m not even convinced that such a thing even exists.  For even if you somehow removed religion from all the witch hunts, inquisitions, holy wars, and so on it still comes with false beliefs.  

False beliefs that teaches that we are born broken beings in need of redemption from god, that we can’t possibly reason without god, that we can’t have a functioning morality without a god, that there’s an in group and an out group and we don’t want to be part of the out group, that we’re somehow at the center of the universe, that we’re better than all of the other created beings, and an infinite number of equally inane and false beliefs besides.

What part of this is in any way harmless? What a bunch of crap. Yeah I lose respect immediately for religious people because clearly you can’t take important issues seriously enough to give it critical thought. And fuck you too! Nobody cares about your miserable experience. Lmfao, edgy as fuck Can’t speak for the other religions but you clearly know dick about Hinduism. While I agree with the point this post is trying to make, I can only counter with this thought:

Religion is there to help the weak feel important. To help the lost find direction. It is not something that I have ever needed, but I understand that some people just can't accept reality. Do I pity them? Sure. But mostly I feel bad for all the kids that get force-fed this stuff for their formative years only to have any semblance of choice removed entirely. I overheard a few religious zealots in Chipotle the other day talking about how they tend to lose some of the kids when they get to about 6th grade as they start to question the teachings, and that they really needed to double down on their efforts to lock down ""harmful free-thinking"" prior to that time in their lives to better increase their chances of extracting tithing from them as they got older. Kinda gross, if I'm honest.

Don't really know where I was going with this comment but here we are. More like fuck Islam. Hinduism is mystic and ethereal with useful yogic methods and philosophy. 

Islam is just a political collectivist cult masked ad religion. Literally nobody asked for your hateful opinion; atheists like you who shit on religion and other beliefs like this actually make me embarrassed to be unreligious.

I wish you knew that religion provides moral and emotional support for those that actually need it. It brings meaning into their lives and keeps them happy. I’ve seen atheists become MUCH better individuals after converting. It’s not just about believing in a God. It’s also about self-improvement.

You’re shitting on it because you think you’re an intellectual superior. You’re not; I guarantee you if you act like this in real life no one is going to like you. 

Actually fucking cringe. I couldn't care less about God and I'm not discussing whether he exists or not. So, what i wanted to say is, the problem is not religion. The problem is within the human nature. Most people are nice and decent because they fear Hell, want a reward after death, or simply fear  getting put in jail. Remove these fears, and all these civilized people will eat each other. Imagine religion doesn't exist. One day, the government makes a public statement that within the next 12 hours, everything is legal. Murder, rape, theft, you name it. What do you think the streets will look like then ? No one cares you are not better than everyone else. Get off you reddit high horse and go back to r/atheism where you belong. Here's the problem with everything you've had to say. Although you don't want to believe in a god, that. doesn't mean you're gonna force atheism on everyone else now. Take Sikhism for example, everything isn't about believing in god, a large majority of the religion just teaches you about respect, honesty, integrity, empathy, and many other characteristics you should have anyways. Your approach is really bad, be an atheist if you want, but that doesn't mean you're going to force it down everyone else's throat. Stopped reading halfway through. I’m not religious or a believer either but I don’t scream at people about it. Nobody has the answers. Fuck atheists. Fuck their arrogant, narcissistic viewpoint that they know what happens after death, an experience they've never had. Fuck their need to embellish their superiority for ""knowing the truth""

Hard to ever convince someone to change with extreme sentiment like that isn't it? Hard to actually strike up a conversation with such extreme views isn't it? 

Truth be told no one knows for sure what happens to you when you die. It's why religion exists, to give people peace of mind over something we have troubles even comprehending or knowing as the experience itself is usually permanent. Some people believe we are nothing more than flesh and blood, spawned here to do nothing but reproduce, pass on our traits, and die. Others believe we are more than just meatsacks and that there is a purpose to all this. Religion at least shows some openness to the idea of spirituality, or at least a willingness to think about and discuss it. Why is that such a bad thing? I ONLY LOVE ALLAH NO OTHER RELIGION, I AM ALLAHIST  First humans didn’t come from Africa mate Buddhism is a teaching not a religion. He was a man, not a god. Do not judge that which you do not understand. You missed an important word .. Fuck all ORGANIZED religion. Just because people us religion as an excuse doesn’t mean the religion is causing those terrible things. Evil people will do evil way whether they have a religion or not. Wow so edgy and deep Atheism is a religion, so fuck atheism as well Fuck you nigga The cringe is real. ye and i will fuck you and your stinky indian mother XD ""This ONE fairy tale, this one is real."" Is how I feel about religious people. well fuck u too bitch This is the edgiest post I've ever seen. Fuck you asshole stupid indian Cocaine is fun but you need to cut back some Fuck you This guy has clearly never done dmt. He also speaks like he knows anything. You dont know anything and your claims as to what happens after you die are unfounded, ignorant, and unresearched. Fuck you, you know it all pseudointellectual twat. Also, inversely I love you and your teenage mind. You're ignorant to believe that. You know how fucking insane it is that's we're even here right now? You know what's more unbelievable than an afterlife? Fucking LIFE. THIS LIFE. You don't know shit, I don't know shit, nobody knows shit except for the ones who have died. Best not to go around being a piece of shit if you can't ACTUALLY back any aspect of your argument up. STFU stupid ass!! Looks at atheist north korea, soviet union, china.... well that did not go well. Cringe You know all these so called facts are merely hypothesis. I know that I for one am genetically a descendant of Neanderthal who were in Europe for at least a couple million years. And those same people had already discovered fire.... In fact research shows that homo erectus could use fire. Cringe bro, all the shit you said is such uneducated garbage, I actually started to believe you were going to make a point that made sense somewhere. It's due to fear of the uncontrollable. Every single human wants to have control over every aspect of their lives, so that they can prevent bad things from ever happening to their loved ones.

The idea that bad things can happen to them, for no fault of their own, with no way to control or prevent it is terrifying to people.

So terrifying that they'll rather believe anything else - including fictional omnipotent beings (god), fictional omnipotent forces (reiki, vaastu, feng shui etc.), karma, multiple lives, rebirth etc.

It's a widespread, unacknowledged mental health problem. All of these people have severe anxiety and fear, and need counseling/therapy. Wow you’re so edgy You’re not an atheist. Your religion is shitting on streets. Well, angry... In all honesty it's great to have an opinion. Although, religion itself has caused nothing, It's used to justify why people murder, otherwise it would have been over other reasons like land, money or power. As long as there are bad people, acts of hate and crime will forever exist. Some people need a beleif in a higher power to help justify a reason to be good, a reason not to murder or steal.

Thank you for reading my crappy comment and have a fantastic day! Wouldn't accept such an emotional speech. Religious people can use emotions againt you too. So much ignorance in one post and the comments below. God (or whatever) save the future of this planet with such wannabe fools. > You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe.

That's literally a part of Buddhism. You can't just lump all religions together because a couple of them piss you off.

I don't disagree with you. I just can't agree with you either. Who cares, fuck you [deleted] So , to anyone reading this one out of thousands of comments . Hey ! I would like to tell you that you matter . Never let stuff get in your head . Your faith is yours , you have the right to practise ,profess and propagate it . Religion is a concept that helps cope millions in their time of desperation and about the blood . People have killed each other over food , do you stop eating it totally ? No , because its a savage (man this word has lost meaning nowadays) humans instinct to kill . And they will believe in any bullsh*t reason to do so . sheesh, op is trying to compensate for a super small dick here so hard it's funny I agree 💯% with you.But here's a little known fact: There was no such thing as religion in the Indian culture. You see, there's no such word as ""Religion"" or ""The God"" in Sanskrit. Hinduism isn't a religion, it's a culture. What’s in it for you? Let people live how they want, no one need to listen to your sorry ass So do you happen to have an explanation of how such a complex universe came into being or do you happen to believe the theory of random reactions causing this? Although it is the most plausible theory for scientists but it doesnt make sense at all to anyone who isn't desperate to find a reason that proves that god is a lie. The way you speak is how a suicidal or depressed person speaks, perhaps it's time you should see someone for it. What did Buddhism do? Pretty sure that whole thing is just based on “This dude chilled so hard once that he he ran out of fucks to give” Jesus fuck, who pissed in your cereal #FUCK U TOO how people are free to type long messeges 😂 I don't agree.

Until today I will never understand why people cannot live and let live because everybody is allowed to believe in what they want and also to practice what they want.

Religions have a personal meaning for every human being and this should be accepted because it is also okay if you think that there is no God and you just want to talk yourself into believing that there is no God. This is also your own opinion which you should keep for yourself and not try to convince everyone as the right one. Although what seems to be right for you doesn't have to be so for the other person. In my opinion a religion serves the people not only to form something beautiful after death - there is much more to it. If you believe there is no God then you feel this personally and you don't have to shout that all this is stupid and nonsense.

I myself am religious, but I also accept people who do not think that way, several people should do it slowly and understand and not rush against everyone. How do you know all this? What’s so bad about having faith? You just look depressed af. There’s no need to knock anyone because they choose to believe in something based on faith. It’s not like religion is the only thing that has caused war in the past. In the past, humans found whatever reason they could to kill each other, the world is undeniably more civilized than it was hundreds of years ago. Nothing is perfect buddy, religion is not perfect. Science is not perfect. Just let people believe what they want to believe and maybe there would be less polarization and less violence in the world, how about that? This smells like a copypasta. Keep calm and carry on. No one would fuck with you for being an atheist in India. But a Muslim friend from India told me, abusing Islam would definitely get you killed. Okay, I think we can have interesting talk here. I know the bible very good, and I AGREE with the complaints you have against what the other religions are teaching about.

Death

 For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing at all, nor do they have any more reward, because all memory of them is forgotten.  Also,  their love and their hate and their jealousy have already perished, and  they no longer have any share in what is done under the sun.

  Whatever your hand finds to do, do with all your might, for there is no work nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom in the Grave, where you are going.  

## Ecclesiastes 9:5,6,10

**Reincarnation Phenomena Explained**

ONE of the objections to the theory  of reincarnation is that the vast majority of people on earth have no  recollection at all of having lived before. Furthermore, they do not  even think that they could have lived earlier lives

Hell

 The Hebrew word *Sheol,* which referred to the “abode of the  dead,” is translated “hell” in some versions of the Bible. What does  this passage reveal about the condition of the dead? Do they suffer in  Sheol in order to atone for their errors? No, for they “know nothing.”  That is why the patriarch Job, when suffering terribly because of a  severe illness, begged God: “Protect me in hell \[Hebrew, *Sheol*\].”Job 14:13; *Douay-Rheims Version*)  What meaning would his request have had if Sheol was a place of eternal  torment? Hell, in the Biblical sense, is simply the common grave of  mankind, where all activity has ceased.

heaven

 **The Little Flock**

 Who,  then, make up this little flock having such a wonderful prospect? The  followers of Jesus Christ who receive an anointing with holy spirit. (Acts 2:1-4)  Seeing them as heavenly singers with harps in their hands, the apostle  John wrote: “I saw, and, look! the Lamb standing upon the Mount Zion,  and with him a hundred and forty-four thousand having his name and the  name of his Father written on their foreheads. These are the ones that  did not defile themselves with women; in fact, they are virgins. These  are the ones that keep following the Lamb no matter where he goes. These  were bought from among mankind as first fruits to God and to the Lamb,  and no falsehood was found in their mouths; they are without blemish.”​—Revelation 14:1,4,5

Great Crowd

  What does John see? “A great crowd, which no man was able to number, out  of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the  throne and before the Lamb.” **(Read Revelation 7:9-14 We have seen the gathering of millions whose hope is to live on the earth forever.\` God's original plan for mankind**

Religion and War

  Christians  are not authorized to fight against their enemies. The apostle Paul  wrote to fellow Christians: “If possible, as far as it depends on you,  be peaceable with all men. Do not avenge yourselves.”​—Romans 12:18,19

Instead  of sending his followers to war, Jesus told them: “Continue to love  your enemies and to pray for those who persecute you, so that you may  prove yourselves sons of your Father who is in the heavens.” (Matthew 5:44,45) Even when the nation in which they live goes to war, Christians should remain neutral, “no part of the world.” (John 15:19)  If God wants his worshipers in all nations to love their enemies and  to remain separate from the world, how could he support either side of a  violent conflict today?

Free Will

 God also gave us the mental abilities, such as the powers of perception,  reason, and judgment, that work in harmony with free will. These enable  us to think, weigh matters, make decisions, and distinguish right from  wrong. Hebrews 5:14)  We were not created to be like mindless robots that have no will of  their own; nor were we created to act primarily out of instinct, as were  the animals.

 Go in through the narrow gate, because broad is the gate and spacious is the road leading off into destruction, and many are going in through it; [ ](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/dx/r1/lp-e/1001070144/23446)whereas narrow is the gate and cramped the road leading off into life, and few are finding it. Matthew 7:13,14

This is why we are different than most because we are on the Narrow road.

. >We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion

220,000 people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki would beg to differ, only if they were alive. What is this hateful trash Hurr Hurr im a edgy atheist hurr hurr. Fuck off. I dont believe in any religions. However, I dont think we can simple say that all religions are bad, the world would be a better place without it.

Bad thing happened with or without religions.

Religions are something happened in human history, fit for the time when they was created,  with their own value and limitation.

They are still alive now, which means their historical misson are not finished. The time has not come. Accept it. Religion without science is blind
Science without religion is lame - Albert Einstein.

Just my two cents. If you cant prove that God exists, you certainly can't prove he doesn't. 

Atheism is in fact a faith. A faith that there's no God.
And sure some really bad things are done in the name of religion, but some very very bad things that happened were irrespective of religion. WW2 for instance, or Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 
Downvote if you want, but this is reality and there are a few true atheists, majority are just sheeps following what's cool and after the idea their actions have no consequences. What so ever. Watch what your hatred has turned you into, the exact thing you hated. And I obviously speak only philosophically. The only difference between them and you is that you hate just one more religion than them. If I were to extrapolate your being into a more agressive and affirmative one, you'd be with them with your guns and shooting them both. 
Belief and disbelief are equally harmful. It's not the belief in their god(s) that makes people kill in the name of religion but the disbelief in other's. 

I'm disappointed in you. Fuck ALL religions?

Oh how egalitarian of you.

Ok enlightened centrist.


Edit: please continue to downvote me while awarding centrists. Keep doing that. That's why we are here and why we will stay here for a long time. Even if we get out we will eventually come back to this place. Good work. Nope. Violent people will be violent regardless of religion. There's no shortage of violence committed in the name of atheism either (communists etc). Definitely should be here r/unpopularopinion Religion solves real problems, traditions are smart solutions to old forgotten problems, idk I’m from America so it’s easy to say this, but this is one of the least “speak truth to power” things you can say, you’re on reddit after all, the utter home of atheism. Dude, don't apply the same label of Sanatan Dharm on other ideologies. Or, rather, specifically, Buddhism. Yes, I'm a Buddhist and I claim that you clearly haven't read anything about Buddhism to be whining and shaming the ideology in this manner. And no, Buddhism is not a religion. It's just an ideology. And no, I don't give a penny's fuck about what Wiki says, what Dictionary says. As someone who has been following Buddhism for her entire life, allow me to inform you that it is not a religion. Keep your stupidity away from its name. my sympathies Anyone who thinks religion is made up be it any I am talking about the concept of God or a maker here explain what's 0+0 ?? 🤗😂🤦🏽‍♀️ Yup that's what I thought I entirely agree with you however the deeper question is not what is after death. It is why the universe is here and how/why it was formed. I agree crediting a god for the phenomenon of existence is low effort. Science will ultimately work hard give us concrete forms of an answer. However from a philosophical point of view there are certain questions which will likely always remain unanswered. If time is a construct of the universe being in its current state, what is the universe's true form and can we know it? Where did it come from? Why? These trouble people and I agree that religion takes the mind away from the question and life. Your post was so well written and I hope you'll enjoy this point as well.

^(I want be explicitly clear that I am not referring to question of why an given human is here but rather the universe ) It's clear OP follows Judaism. He didn't mention it. I think I saw this same rant in Ready Player One. I understand that you're pissed, I am too. But blaming what happened or whatever bad happens is like blaming Biology for Coronavirus. 
I don't know if you go to college, office, school, etc, but people of different cultures, religions, regions, etc work/study together. You don't normally see them killing each other over religion. Why do riots happen? Who participates in riots? First analyse the situation, people involved, people who started it or provoked it. 
Look I could have taken offense when you wrote ""F* Islam"", but I didn't because I know that you're pissed and me giving you the finger on the internet is childish. Religious extremism is really bad because it distracts you from the actual religion that you're following. Extremism teaches you exactly the opposite what the message religion wants to convey. It would be more appropriate if you abused ISIS. 
Those people who think that by killing people of other religion is okay will be acceptable by God, they couldn't be more wrong. They will be punished. Everyone's time will come.

I see many comments here who are against religion and calling it a scam. Maybe you're right, maybe you're wrong, but I'll say this, you go your way, I'll go my way, whenever we will meet, I'll greet you with a smile.

Jai Hind. op are you okay ? Lol, another angsty teen. How do you know there is no god? Your hate in religion is a religion in itself. Cool your jets bro. You are probably at the lowest part of the social triangle, and you probably deserve it would you look at that ! baby's atheism phase Dumbass energy flows, and time only grows. It would be kinda stupid if there is nothing after life, so all this shit you wrote is nonsense A higher power exists Atheists and misled orthodox are both toxic to the truth if you ask me Brother, I’m a muslim, i may be corrupt but my religion is not! Please stop taking wrong people as the ambassador of any religion. There are good people in all religions! Lmao at the atheist cope. Buddhism is not a religion. Look know angry you are! You realize that atheism is a belief structure in itself, right? 

I used to be constantly amazed with evangelical atheists until I realized this. Lol so you know there is no god. What a fucking joke. What did Christian ever do to you? May Allah have mercy on you. This is clearly coming from someone who is mad all the time and has a sad life. Nothing to see here Fuck Hinduism Hinduism is not a religion Stupid hindu piece of shit with your bullshit rhetoric of hate. You're not any better than these hindu nationalists for thinking exactly like them ""fuck islam"" is the root cause of hate in this shithole country and you come to reddit to preach this. Have some common decency you fucktard As a Muslim reading about what is happening to Muslims in Idia right now, you really want me to believe we are the bad ones? Or I could point out the genocide happening to us in China or the countries taking turns bombing the crap out of the middle east.

But none of that would compare to the evidence that the Quran has to offer about the perfection of Islam. Haters gonna hate. Isn’t science technically a religion? May God open your hearts. “They all just want to believe in something good after death.” 

I think you’re forgetting about the most terrifying prospect imaginable - an eternity of torment separated from God and the possibility of relief from suffering. I suppose many religious believers begin their spiritual journey preferring total annihilation after death to a belief system like Christianity that allows for such a horrific potentially.

The fact of the matter is that you know that God exists. You simply do not wish to accept him on his terms. You want your sin more than the truth, so you rage against God and all who follow him (however imperfectly) hoping you find comfort in likeminded individuals, of which you’ll find plenty on reddit.

That said, we’re all sinners in need of forgiveness, and it’s never too late for a living person to ask Jesus Christ to open their eyes to the truth of his gospel. There is a way to escape God’s judgment, and it is in the person of his son, Jesus Christ, who lived the perfect life you and I could not, went to the cross and died as a substitute sufferer of God’s wrath that you and I deserve, and who rose from the dead, having satisfied God’s wrath against the sin of all who put their faith in him and submit to him as Lord. It’s only then that a person can expect “something good after death.” Fuck atheism. Fuck all of those who do not believe the truth. Jesus Christ died For you too, but you refuse to believe it. You See the truth but you decide to ignore.

Also the reason for most of the wars that were because of religion actually weren't. Most of em came to be because of resources. Religion was nothing but a made up reason. Human is a greedy being

Atheism is evil. Religion is good. But why do you care so much, couldn’t u mind ur own business and just let people live Religion is a belief... as is Atheism. \>  Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension.  

Nope, fuck off. Crazy bastard. Cringe You mad, bro? > Religion has brought us nothing but hardship and mass murder on a scale that would make the Spanish flu look like a minor common cold. Just take a step back and look at the past and see the countless lives that were lost because religion asked to do so

Hey Atheist hypocrites, how about take your own advice. 

> You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter. But matter itself is being part of this universe.

And stop acting like life matters. Stop complaining about suffering if none of this shit matters. Lolololol

For us life matters and the kind of life we live matters because that’s the ideology we believe in. You tell us it’s all man made. Ok let’s say we believe you. Now tell us exactly how you can objectively prove with evidence that life matters and all of your bitching about suffering isn’t just an emotional and subjective rant. Prove to us with evidence that your morality itself isn’t a product of your surrounding and the times we are living in i.e man made. 

It’s quite telling for a movement to claim rationality by appealing to people’s emotions. How does that work exactly, you know because emotions are biased and subjective. You can't exactly use them to prove or disprove anything. Lol soyboi is mad How about no? Fuck aww wewigion. Fuck Hindusim, fuck Iswam, fuck Chwistian, fuck Buddhism.

I don't agree with people calling for religion to be eradicated though because it generates belief and people in times of need and desperation need something like that to latch on to for hope Pro-Atheist trying to convert Religious people into Atheist is same thing .   
What you can do is never bring religion into governance , Keep it at your home .   


Government job is welfare of all people that's it . The main issue is identity politics. How Avicenna ‘prove’ God/Allah/Bhagwan exists

“The full argument is a bit complicated, but here is a somewhat simplified version. Avicenna’s proof actually has nothing to do with design, he doesn’t need the idea that the universe is intelligently put together. Instead, he argues from the idea that the things we see around us are ‘contingent’ or merely ‘possible’.

“The idea here is that a contingent thing is something that may either exist or not exist; its nature does not guarantee that it exists. What Avicenna wants to do is show you that although all the things we experience directly are indeed contingent, there is also something else that exists necessarily, in other words, whose very nature guarantees that it exists.


“To do this, Avicenna points out that since a contingent thing on its own merit could either exist or not exist, it must have some external cause that made it exist - like ‘tipping the scales’ in favor of its existence rather than its non-existence.


“So take me, for instance. I am contingent, meaning that I am the sort of thing that could easily have failed to exist. In fact, at one time I didn’t yet exist, and in the future I will cease existing, that proves I’m not necessary.

“So there must have been a cause, maybe my parents, who brought me into existence. Now Avicenna observes that the aggregate whole of all contingent things – in other words the physical universe – is also contingent. After all, everything in the universe is contingent, so taken all together as one thing, it too must be contingent. Thus it also needs an external cause, just like I do.

“Since that external cause has to be outside the whole aggregate of contingent things, it cannot itself be contingent. So it is necessary. Hey presto, we’ve proven that there is a necessary existent which causes all other things! And this, of course, is God. I think there is a place for religion in our world. However, we are humans first, a brother/sisterhood, a country, a species and all the way at the bottom of the ladder of relevant quantifiers do we find religion. You want to curse organized religion.  The construct of personal religion ( or god for that matter) helps a lot of people get through life. It’s a framework for them to rest their unrest due to the unexplained. 
It’s almost like people never took the science fiction books ( the religious decrees) with a grain of salt.
Then somewhere in the history of time, the organizers solidified their positions and it’s been a shitshow since then
Edit: I personally don’t give a shit about any god. It’s pretty fucking rational and clear to me. The things which I cannot explain are the gaps in humanity’s ability to understand. Doesn’t mean there’s an invisible god out there Is this a copypasta r/copypasta Fuck athiest too /r/justneckbeardthings Dude chill The big bang started out of nothing by nothing, makes sense U really wrote all of this to promote a subreddit 🤦 Who cares ? People have different tastes. You need to chill... Christians saved your country from islam. Might want to show a little gratitude. [removed] That how China survived over 5000 years. Religion is a believe, not a social norms. preaching to the choir buddy Seems strange to me anything exists in the first place, it's just a bit wack. Even with our understanding it doesn't make sense so I like to think theirs a higher power at play, I don't tell people their going to hell or anything like that, I just  like to believe in what I do, i mean if I'm wrong it not like anything bad comes of that, religion has started   to make me a better person so it's not all bad r/copypasta material maybe God is real and there’s proof, sorry I can’t just do what you say and believe when there is tons of proof to the contrary. Go back to r/atheism you cheeto dusted edgelord [removed] Ohh wow a cool progressive person bashing the religion, wow claps claps. So what did religion give you ask? Ohh you dont even ask you just bashed it, again super cool but in the spirit of debating it in unbiased(lol does it exist in debates?) manner let me speak against the motion:

*  **Meaning to Life/Things**: While in todays world it must be irrelevant to most of us but in the past when reddit did not exist and they did not have u/pking3 to guide them through the mysteries of world ,What gave their life a meaning ? What explained unexplainable world to them? What calmed their curiosities , what prevented them from going madand just live like a hunter gatherer always without any other purpose in their life?  
*Downside*: *While it soothed the basic nature of humanity to question things and move forward to other things, it arguably might have might slowed down the development*, but slow and steady wins the race, it was more important that they identify themselves different from animals rather than estabilishing error or noise corrections in the quantum computing and harvesting its quantum entanglement property. Remember how you are first told that sun rises in east in 1st class rather than how the combined result of rotation at tilted axis and revolution of earth around earth gives you days and seasons. I bet you still dont know basic science of why seasons exist, but that is not the point yes sorry.
* **Identity:** Next is giving them an identity, it was required to provide more stability to their life. What provided trust among two random beings at that time? *""Ohh hey bro! I see you are from Meet nagar in Shahdara as well which is thousands of years yet to be, me too, lets grab some beer*"". Trustng each other was the first step towards to give rise to settlements and what promotes trust faster than having same school of thoughts   
 *""Hey bro I worship nature""*  
 *""Ahh i see you are a man of culture as well, join in! Loot us later we are yet to have NRC to ascertain your full identity""*  
*Downside: Ohh you understood already, as population grew , clashes grew on whose imaginary friend was better at protecting them while they died more because of him/them.*
* **Development:**  While necessity is the mother of inventions, who is the mother of necessities? Yes! The competitions, the wars.   
*""Bro i am oldest religion, we have paper manuscrpits and shiz""*  
*""But do you have weaponised stones bro?""*  
*""Bro now we do""*  
*""But but do you have metals and shiz bro?""*  
*""Bro now we do""*  
*""Bro do you have RDX and ammunitions bro? ""*  
*""Bro now we do but bro do you have papers now?""* ..... Only change is it is no longer for religion but for region now. Religionism gave rise to crusades and we had wars anyways without religion reasons as well. Wars are terrible, but they put science on warp speeds.  
*It took 1900 years to find electron in the atom but 50 years to perfect it to ruin the prefectures with Nucleur bomb.*  
*Again it took 1900 years to make the first flying thingy and just 10 years afterwards to make it fight worthy in WW1, or 50 years to reach moon.* and many other examples  
Religion gave rise to groupism which gave rise to competitions which gave rise to development.   
*Downside: No need to repeat*
* **Moral Policing/Accountability:** While cinema is witness that no one left someone ""*Bhagwaan ke liye*"". But then what have made masses to conduct themselves in order within themselves? Who did they fear before our hero u/pking3 came here to spread truth. Somewhere in sometime BC  
*""Bro no one pleez steal it behind me""*  
*""Why bro wathcu guna do""*  
*""Well I have 24 x7 CCTV surveillance, and i will submit it as proof to Police/CRPF to whoever necessary and they will punish you accordingly""*  
*""Huh?""*  
*""I meant God bro, god is all watching and all just""........*  
*Downside: Moral Compass seemed to break during wars with others, this is not a fault of religion though but the followers. No religion asks you to wage war unnecessarily ( i want my comment to stay and not get removed)*
* **Teaching How to Live:** Religion gave us a sense of wrongs and rights, dos and donts. While most of it helped,  few are useless in todays world yes. It prevented human beings from going back to uncivilised culture. Spread harmony ( atleast within the religion) . Gave people a space to grow. Defined a set of rules of conduct, became the parent to parentless, teacher to teacherless.   
*Downside: Regressive rules, few wrong teachings or wrong interpretations.*

There are more reasons but 5 points suffice.  I tried to stay away from religion while pointing these. I agree there is a lot of hate between people now but then Development/ Science can only come after religion whenever Earth is restarted. Fact that you can rant about it now is beacause it helped you and your civilisation to reach this place in the first. It is not all harmful the same way as Science is not all useful. Make everyone atheist and you will see people forming religion again because until Science explains everything, religion will exist. Religion is not religion it is snyonym of hope and beta ""Ummeed pe Duniya Kayam hai"" Wait til you find out why you're just mad, and there is spirituality out there that isn't toxic. You dont really know what happens after death same as religious people. 

Religious folks and atheists are two sides of the same coin as far as I'm concerned. This kind of cringe ngl Yes, a world full of atheists will be truly perfect... LOL. Humans will be humans regardless of faith. Either do something good for the planet or stand out of the way of people that are. Hinduism is not a religion. Your argument is invalid BTW atheists have their own “religion”... Get a grip dude! Seriously, some therapy, a glass of wine maybe? Some weed??? I dunno???? Real mature conclusion 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️😂😂"

Dilip Ghosh, this is the same moron who said Desi cow milk have gold in them. Good. Hope their God protects them, if not, then *insert shrug emoji*. Agreed that BJP is flawed and not perfect (no party is), but why does r/india always resort to Modi Party bashing? 
To the best of my knowledge, I've not come across any post appreciating steps or courses taken by the government towards people's welfare.
Incessant dissent towards everything done by the Govt only lowers reliability of the accuser. I don't know why we are painting BJP as dumb people here. Religion and faith provide good fallbacks when science and technology fail.

It's very normal for people to turn to god's when perhaps science and technology seen incapable. It's a very common human feeling to seek comfort in belief in God or technology and when we feel abandoned by one we naturally gravitate towards the other.

I don't see why this very human stance taken by these people needs to be put up as a BJP stupid meme."

DAFUQ!? Some other propoganda from this site:


Fresh cow dung kills bacteria that cause malaria and TB. Cow dung is used for protection from atomic emission. Cow urine contains copper which transfers into gold in human body. Gold has power to destroy all pathogens. Cow urine also contains iron, calcium, phosphorus, carbonic acid, potash and lactase. It contains 24 types of salt and several useful medicines are made from cow urine.

> SSIAST Trust **in collaboration with National Institute of Plant Health Management** jointly makes significant contribution to promote environmentally sustainable plant health management practices through **training and research** for the developmental activities **to enhance the knowledge and skill of the volunteers and progressive farmers**.

SSIAST will now be able to **train farmers** in the Govt. of India's PGS (Participatory Guarantee System) and **certify them as such**. Who knew Indian cows had so much honesty. Maybe we can elect a cow instead of Modi for next term. Buffalos are a new minority now. Smh Fucked up part is that many would agree that this is true. We're fucked right to the core of the country arent we? Barring a few patches of sanity which involve less than 10% of the country, this is what the rest of India is like isnt it?  bhains = tan kaalaa aur man bhi kaalaa Looks like his videsi gai left him for another guy.
His desi gai stayed though What's the criteria for being declared honest? Shouldn't it be said as racist... Poor buffalo's being discrimated ...  As I veterinary student, it is my experience that the opposite is true in almost all the points. Exotic breeds have a friendlier temperament than indigenous ones, while also having higher production and better feed conversion efficiency. Local breeds are much more aggressive and a nightmare to treat.
And Buffalo milk is much better suited for making products like ice cream, butter, etc due to more fat percentage while buffaloes themselves are more disease resistant in general, and cleaner as they have almost no hair and love bathing in water.
Also, there is no 'surya ketu' nerve. Well none that I've ever read about in any anatomy textbook. M.Tech. Gau Rakshak Last 3 points for buffaloes are sketches of Bollywood villains. Lol at the milk point being mentioned after a statistic on the intestine. UNSECO has declared Indian cow (Gaumata) as the best in the world.

Fuck IITJEE
 FIITJEE is the most fucked up institute. Their math books start with equations. Like wtf. They know how to make simple things tough. They produce top rankers only because of large enrollment numbers and a handful of south Delhi teachers. I remember last time they referred 'Ram Rajya'.
Edit: I forgot about their mentions in Paradise papers. And yes these Institute do not teach science. Science is not sitting in a room and solving questions for two long year. Krishna killed a bunch of people after lyying to them. I doubt he gives a fuck about shit like poaching faculty. नासतो विद्यते भावो नाभावो विद्यते सतः ।

 If I hate this ad... Will I go to hell ?  +1 on fiitjee is cancer. Studied there full time for 2 years only to realize that my time and self confidence was wasted Meh, its advertising. End of the day they will still teach science only Its a private company, it can do what it wants, right? People can just choose not to go there. The ad is deplorable. But Fiitjee is way better than narayana and chaitanya. Atleast where I studied. We live in a 1.3 billion society where 50% of the population is under 25. Blame the competition and lack of resources to educate the students. Peer pressure just adds depression into this primordial soup. 

When I studied in fiitjee (did not clear iitjee but got into a well known college) . There were no extra classes and we were taught Just the subject and given phase books. (8 phases in 2 years). You get into a good college if by yourself are motivated to study harder. Peer pressure kept us on our toes. Their material is good. More importantly, I learned to practice self-discipline. Something that was very useful when I entered college. I saw so many burned out people in IIT tanking their GPA from other  pre-university institutes.  Dude every iit jee Institute is like that all are fuckin pricks and sometimes even teachers are racists  Kalyug isn't an *idea*, it's a cosmological time-frame described in the Vedic literatures.

434,Science/Technology,One of the good effects of lockdown is that air quality has improved a lot.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/friwew/one_of_the_good_effects_of_lockdown_is_that_air/,"One of the positive effects of lockdown is that air quality has improved a lot and pollution is going down.

It should be noted that worldwide more people die due to air pollution than what the covid19 has claimed till date.

While we have been very serious about tackling the virus threat we have literally done nothing to tackle the air pollution threat which claims more lives.

Let us all support reduction of pollution be it air,water or soil.

Edit : I am using technology to put my thoughts out to everyone. I am not anti science or anti technology nor development, rather my point is currently whatever we are doing has been causing more harm than good. So let us strive to make more informed choices in future be more wise , make sure we try to change tracks for cleaner technology.

Maybe consume less, support clean tech., work to clean out rivers and lakes, plant more trees and not cut them ,use less plastic ... there can be many small things we can start with and go forward."," Humans are the cancer Dude yes. I've been hoarding air on the rooftop. Bc le lo jabhtak hai. Once life resumes it'll be shit again. I start panicking when I read the damage done to children's lungs just by living in Delhi and I have to distract myself from thinking that because it's frankly depressing I'm pretty sure in the long run pollution would have caused more death than the virus. God knows how many cancers have been caused because of us not respecting the environment. Maybe the world can initiate a movement to hold a weeklong (or two) lockdowns annually so as to give nature a breather.   
We can also use this time for meditation and reflect on our lives. Operation success.

There are so many neuroscience studies on the effect of drugs, videogames, sex, tv, facebook etc on our brains - but different forms of meditation are not as studied. Each one would yield different results. It's time these were scientifically scrutinized.

 The only question is whether unsatisfactory results will be allowed to be published. > SATYAM

This government sure knows how to spin creative acronyms. Very welcoming! We should do more research on this rather than Harvard or Stanford.
There is a lot of research that these two institutions do inspite of yoga being an Indian thing. We should try to match them. Where's the problem OP? There are already many international universities researching the benefits of meditation on the brain. Why shouldn't India do it? Don't expect me to spit on something just because it's connected to religion and you have problems with it. *Disclaimer: If the paper shows yoga and meditation have no major impact on health The Truth Ministry will make sure the researcher get Vyapamed™. Please read the terms and conditions carefully before applying. BMJK. OP you are a scumbag. This project might actually help in getting rid of dumb pseudoscience and superstition associated with yoga and ayurveda. Stop dissing on Indian culture and arts just cos they dont fit your worldview, you goddamn pseudo-secular self-hating commie fake-liberal fake-scientific thinker. I dont mind the request from the ministry , what i worried here is how much of these research are going to be genuine , as there is more chance , few of the research later on can be used by this govt to support yoga and meditation being implemented ...like say while watching a movie in a theatre... Soon Research Proposals for Cow Dung and Gau mutra  Whatever Yoga & Meditation might be, they are definitely NOT science and technology. People who think Yoga & Meditation are science and technology don't understand what science is."
437,Science/Technology,[Serious Post] Bye,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f161mw/serious_post_bye/,"It's about time for me. I don't see the relevance of trying to go through the drudgery again and again. I beg for some patience on your part to go through this post.

At 30 years of age with no set path for a career, I am utterly useless. I can't even provide for myself, let alone take care of others.

I am a 30-year-old, so-called general category lower-class family, man. Haha, how pathetic, isn't it.

&#x200B;

I was a good student till Xth, and then the slow downhill started in my scores. Struggling to pass 12th in state medium with 70% with just pass 50% in mathematics.

&#x200B;

Then, coming from a lower-class family, there were not enough choices for me to go through - either Medical or ENgineering. I prepared for Medical taking a 1-year gap. Nothing substantial came out of it. In the end, I had to go to engineering. Because sadly, in our country, gap years are a strict no-no for any of the stakeholders and I could not waste 1 more year.

&#x200B;

Did [B.Tech](https://B.Tech) in engineering in Applied Electronics & Instrumentation from one of the 'good' private colleges in Bhubneswar, Odisha. Yes, here in Odisha - so you might have guessed my economic conditions. Passed with Average CGPA of 7.1.

&#x200B;

No jobs came in the engineering field. At last, I was recruited by the service company (name starts with I) and had to go \\ for it.  This was 6 years back.

Why?

Because there was no alternate way for me. I am now the sole bread-earner of the family. My dad has retired from his job.

Trained in Mysore - I was not from a programming background. I found it really hard to go through the training especially the advanced chapters. I had to take a retest for the final exam since I failed in the first one. In the retest, I literally had to take the help of some kind souls who took pity on me and shared their answers. I passed with a retest with minimum pass marks.

GOt posted to Mangalore. Here, literally at the opposite side of India from where I cam from - I felt alone. Loneliness became my best friend. I avoided getting into any projects there -  be it support or development. Because I knew in my heart that I could not do it.

After a gap of almost 1 year there, I was forced by some managers into a support project. In this team, seeing my utterly bad skills, they put into a 1st level support person - a triage one - someone who acts as the first point of contact for customers, records their issues, creates incidents, tickets and passes onto other teammates. Literally this for 1 year.

Then, slowly they put me into an application support where SQL work along with a niche technology called TM1.

Being absolutely weak in any other technologies, let alone niche technologies - i could not really improve upon my situation.   Thus, they kept me in a bare minimum work state in this one too. because frankly I could not doa anything else.

I remained in this project for 4.5 years, then took a transfer to Bhubaneswar. Here, I avoided again, getting into projects for 1 year or more and then was again forcibly put into a support project where Informatica, Unix, TM1, Cognos is being used. I am in this one, at present.

HEre as well, seeing my lack of skills, I was put into a bare minimum level. My lead has literally scolded me so many times that I have become numb.

Below are not excuses or points to validate my inactions - they are just plain naked truths.

NOw after all this, you and hell, I would have asked myself -

what I am doing about it?

What I am doing to learn new skills?

What am I doing to even get into another job?

The answer is nothing. NOthing.  Why?

because I am listless.

I lack the memory right now to retain anything at all. I keep forgetting common things or points let aline study and become proficient in a programming language.

I lack the logical reasoning a person has to learn to actually code.

I lack the mathematical skills.

Now would you believe me if I told you I had scored 100/100 in my Xth Computer Science exam - consisting of OOPS, and Blue Java.

But now, I know what utter waste was that - not worth 2 paise in India and in this hyper-competitive world.

&#x200B;

Since these 6 years now, I have remained severely depressed with OCD patterns coming in as well. My memory has faded. My enthusiasm is gone for anything. Nihilism in my mind. I have tried to come out of it - I am not saying this lightly. I have tried to take away my mind on dwelling on these things and escape through any of the multiple options for a person to get some enjoyment - songs, podcasts, movies, etc.. But nothing works. I, after doing any of this, feel an existential dread as to what I have done in my life to deserve this moment of just happiness says while going to a movie or hearing to some podcasts. Guilt-tripping at its finest.

Sometimes in the middle of a day, I see something or think of something and I break down. Tears and only tears even on a bright day. At night, tears are my only friend.

You might think, where are my friends or family who can help me. The answer is I really do not have any such friends whom you can call at 2 am and speak your sorrow and get a shoulder to cry on.

My family, well - they had high hopes for me. My dad and mum had put everything to get me a good education and now I am in such a state. They are slowly coming to the conclusion that I am an utter failure.

My lifeline has been shredded by my inactions, my lack of skills, lack of intent to improve my situation. And now, too much time has passed. And I honestly don't see any point in it.

Sometimes I wish in my loved one's mind, I cease to exist - their memory of mine being faded in an instant - so that they do not have to go through the pain which they would feel when I take away my life.

What a sorry, pathetic, selfish piece of shit stain am I? You are thinking this, aren't you? Yes, I am that. I am all of them and much more.

But there is literally no way to go on any further for me. I do not see any career paths for me, I am not good at anything, I lack memory, I lack any interest in any field to be proficient in.

All doors are shut for me now.

Today while walking down the road, I suddenly wished what would happen if I just walk right into a front of any ofo the trucks which are passing by.

At least people would be spared seeing such an utter wastrel of a being which I have become to fall down further.

Thus, I have prepared everything to end it swiftly - I have put nominations with my mother's name on it for the 1 account I had. I have everything which they would need in one email - which is just waiting in my drafts to be sent.

I have written my goodbyes to them and prayed to them - they please forget they ever had a son. To erase my memories. I am written my farewell to my loved ones.

Now, thank you, dear readers, for going through this post. You have empathy and I pray for it to grow in your heart.

Bye."," You seriously need counseling. These thoughts are no jokes. 

What really blows my mind is how our lives are similar yet different. 

I didn't get any decent job for about 2 years after I finished my B.Tech. When I got one after a year or so my company decided to close the unit and everyone lost their jobs. 

Then I started to teach few students and decided to try for government job. Even cleared all the exams but failed to get into final selection list. 

Then I joined another company and there I got into an accident. 

I severely damaged my arm and doctors told me to avoid heavy work for at least 2 years later. I took few steps back and started to teach in a college as a part time assistant lecturer. 

Even after all the bad luck I never felt hopeless. 

I am still in search for a decent job but I always try to be optimistic. 

I recommend you to get professional help before hurting yourself. You sir, are not a failure. You have managed to persevere till this day even with the constant downs in your life. Better things await you in your life from here on. 

Try getting a professional help as I have heard many people here saying that it really helps. And lastly don't lose hope. Please dm. We can talk. I can totally relate to the post. Don't take this step and take some counselling ASAP. You should try giving highschool students English tuitions. People from small towns will pay good money. Your writing skills are really good. You don't even need a degree to open private tuitions. He is not responding to any of the posts here.....I hope he is alright :( There's millions of others who share your story my friend. Even worse situation than you. Also think about those illiterates ones as well. You know what those illiterates would say to you "" Atleast you are educated, one day or the other you will find a job, whatever it will be, but for us there is nothing else."" 

I'm not stopping you to feel frustrated. But it has no solutions. Saying goodbye here won't change your life soon. It will always be a struggle and even if you find a job, the struggles won't end there. You will be forced to drop all your morality and education into the gutter when situation arises you to do things against your policy and wishes. Cuz then you would call it survival for the fittest.

What you feel right now won't be the same in the future. You have to understand this is real life. You will face this situation when you feel completely lost and in vain. Happens to the best of us and even to the worst. 

Without giving my old cridentials, I'll tell you I used to Manage a floor of 300 employees worldwide. Now for the past decade I work at a local wineshop as a manager. My team consists of uneducated asswipes who steal and behave as if they are hardworking fellas. They think I'm a fool, when I know every angle of their stealing from the shop. But I stay silent and cover their ass cuz they really are hardworking fellas. So do I feel sad that how my life changed, yes. But is it worth it, definitely not. I realized my circumstances and did whatever I could find to survive. Sucking up my standards and ego. If you can do that, you are a winner. 

All the doors aren't shut like you said. Because even I thought all the doors was shut 10 years ago, when I was at ICU battling for my life for 3 days. After 20 days in the hospital, I got discharged with an heavy bill and payments to others. Almost lost my home and family back then. Suicide was the only solution for me. Because my ego didn't allow me to accept failure. Now, I'm here replying to you like a future. Think about it man, 10 years ago, I was you. And I wasn't lucky, it was worse even after backing out of suicide. Nothing changed, I was still the same frustrated man. But there's something called as TIME. it changes things man. It really does. For every living beings. It's the law of the nature. 

You can be anything, only if you want it to be. It is the only truth. Dude, firstly stop whatever you are planning to do.

Just read this thread, one of these suggestions might work for you.

Secondly, don't relate your worth with how much you wealth you have, or even how many friends you have. Remember, at the end of the day, we have to save ourselves. 

So please take care of yourself. Start doing things you like.

Don't like anything? Think about yourself as a child, what were your dreams? What did you like to do? Do that. Watch the clouds, breathe the air, go to any park, sit there. Look at nature, feel that you are alive. 

Listen to your heartbeat. Put a mirror in front of you and cry your heart out. And keep looking at yourself, tell yourself ""it's okay to cry, it's okay to feel down, but this is not the end of me.""

Call your parents, talk to them. Ask about their day, just listen to the sweetness in their voice.

Eat whatever you like. Think of all the good food that you like, go buy some fruits you like, eat that.

Get a new haircut, dress yourself nicely. Go for runs in the morning, exercise or play a sport.

The idea is to keep your body moving, do things that you like, take care of your mental health and tell yourself ""it's okay, it's okay to feel down""  this too shall pass. [And it's not your fault](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQht2yOX9Js). 

Take control of your life! Live! “Man’s search for meaning” by Viktor Frankl - PLEASE read this book. It might give you some encouraging perspectives on life. Please don’t take any impulsive decision. You are strong!! Hi, PM me. 


My fiancé said he will find you get a job in his company, if that’s the issue. We could help you out financially if that’s an issue as well. Whatever you need, we’ll help you. I’ve already lost a brother to suicide, I will absolutely not let you do this. 

PM ME.   We’re here to talk to you. 


Don’t be dumb. Don’t do this. 


Reach out. I’m here for you. Buddy, you should hone your skills in some other field when you have the free time, even if it doesn't reap any financial benefits. Reading this post, I feel that you should give writing a shot. Just because you do not have the skills to do well in one isolated field does not mean you are useless. It is a very childish reason to feel any sort of guilt. Hope you see things the way they really are. Have a good day. [deleted] This is the state of mind of all non successful IT guys, trust me I have seen few of my useless colleagues getting 2x package jump in new companies and I am still at the same company , it feels bad to see non talented people getting good jobs, but life is that way , just be happy with whatever job you have , just don't compare yourself with the guys getting better pay, compare with those who don't have job at all Hey man. Life is a long marathon. You haven't even completed the first set of laps. It sounds like you have a job but you're not motivated at it but you don't want to quit just yet and try a career change. That's fair. Why don't you throw yourself into learning something relevant to your career? Go back to the basics and re-learn things again. You'll be impressed by how much you've learnt that you've put into practice. There are lots of free courses out there.

It also sounds like you are having a difficult time at work. We don't talk about our emotions often in India. Why don't you ask your team lead out for lunch on a weekend or something? Say you have something important to tell them and ask them to meet you outside work. Be honest and tell them about your challenges and your hopes and ask them if they can help you in any way. You would be surprised at how people react to honesty. Frankly, it might make the person relieved because it's much easier working with an existing employee instead of finding a new one and training them from scratch.

The other thing that seems to bother you is the fact that you seem to be the breadwinner. If that's the case then why don't you have a discussion with your Dad and figure out how much the family needs monthly so that you don't stress yourself out by thinking you need a much larger sum than what you actually need?

All in all, it sounds like you're aware of your problems. That's a good sign. Never underestimate the power of self-belief. You just have to do better today than yesterday. Friends are not disappointed in you and they don't want to avoid you. They're just waiting for you to reach out. Hey, yes you! Listen to me dawg there’s nothing in this world that’s not achievable and I mean every word of that sentence. I think it’s right to tell you that I know how you’re feeling and what you’re going through as I was in the similar situation just like this where though of taking my own life also struck my mind. Everyone around me thought that I was an abomination but little as they knew, they’re the same people telling me what a change I made in my life towards a better future. I know what it feels to have no friends or family to talk to. I was an introvert too so making new friends seemed far too unlikely.

Let me tell you few changes you need to start making in your lifestyle starting now to achieve the set goal. And remember these are just baby steps which will make you feel good about yourself and think positive.
1. Always go to bed before midnight and sleep at least 7-8 hours every single day.
2. Wake up, jog for half an hour, get back take a bath and have breakfast.
3. Go to work thinking what an amazing day it is and do listen to few melodies on the way.
4. Start from basics and learn your way upwards. Never think what your companions might say or do.
5. On your way home from work stop at some local market and get some fruits/vegetables for you and your family.
6. [MUST] Visit nearby temple of whatever religion you believe in and spend an evening there daily.
7. Meet new people, have a little chat about how their day was and tell them about you.
8. Get home spend time with your family, have a dinner together if you could, watch some TV.
9. Attend social gathering as much as you can.
10. Never be alone, be with someone always.
11. Don’t drink/smoke/drugs. Never become addicted to something. Try once or twice but don’t let it consume you.
12. Stop binge watching TVs and movies, I used to do that a lot and it just ends up wasting much time, Haha.
13. Last but not the least, never stay at home in your spare time. Go out wherever you want. Just be outside. Do whatever you want. It helps to cultivate your mind for new possibilities and improvise.

God Bless you! You have an amazing life ahead of you waiting for you to just explored.

P.S. If you ever need to talk to someone about anything don’t ever hesitate to message/DM me.  Before you take any steps, please teach out to a counsellor. Just as a last effort. I can understand the stagnation you must feel, but know this a lot of people are in the same boat, including me. I am 36 and as lost as I can be. I dont want to pursue my earlier career path and have been unemployed for depressing long. No idea what I want to do anymore. I know the feeling when at night you think that you were simply not to wake the next day, it would be no loss to anyone, including yourself. Please, please reach out to a counsellor. Man if you change your decision (I think you should) try to understand not everyone is going to win the race somehow my parents taught me this very well and I have learnt to be content of what I have even before I started graduation.
You are just looking for happiness in wrong places.
Quit everything go and talk to old monks and use your physical health to help in whatever way you can.
What is stopping you? You might stay poor for the rest of your life but you will be a 'Brave poor' ending your life is only gonna bring more misery to your name and your parents.

If you really care about them do something with your life.Literally anything trust me deep down all parents just want their children to be a good human being over being rich.

Trust me if you are not doesn't mean you are a coward.I agree some people are born intelligent but that doesn't make you a coward.You have to develop the will to fight by yourself.

And I ll say it again not everyone is destined for being rich and all.If you're not succeeding in your life then you are just going on a path which is not yours. Try and be optimistic my friend. Start changing one thing at a time. Damn. I felt that hard. I'm doing medschool and I thought depression was not that big. How utterly wrong I was. 

As suggested by many about counselling. Go for it. What you'll get are anti-depressants and good sound advice. That'll make you better.

As for finance, now that you won't be listless enough (anti-depressants and mood stabilisers kick in in about a month) you can start developing new interest in your work.

Once you are out of it, as a 30 y/o, you'll have a lot of experience. Use it to start loving your job. Or finding new one later on. 

Don't be too hard on yourself. You are educated. You'll do fine. Hi, I'm really sorry you're going through all of this. Please please please consider going for counselling/therapy. These are signs of depression. And it's no joke. You're not being pathetic at all. As someone who was once in depression, I partly understand how you might be feeling. But therapy really really helped me.

Please consider going for therapy. DM me if you want to talk. Take care. Just saying these same things to a psychiatrist could help immensely. Right now, the thoughts have overcrowded and want to be let out
Always remember these words ""nothing is permanent but change""
 
Believe me, if your head is clear,  the solutions will follow. Maybe you've neglected your wellbeing until now. That needn't be the case henceforth.
Life is learning. And the initial stages are difficult but essential for growth. If you just seek for help, youd be surprised how others are willing to help you. You dont need the whole world to care for you to get out of your rut, you just need a few good ones. 

Please seek help for the sake of youself and for the sake of your near and dear ones. A good you, mentally,  emotionally is all they ask of you.
Economic situation will follow. 

Learn to cultivate a positive mindset.
Get a hobby, pastime and spend time on them regularly. And now, you owe it to redditors here too to take care of yourself

Its never too late. Dear OP, the company you mentioned do provide some sort of help for people with depression and such thoughts. Even though that company is not the best, this is a really good initiative. Do reach out of those people in your office, talk to them. Help is within your reach sir. And having worked in same company, i have seen people with far less communication and writing skills than you being in top positions. Dont lose heart Mate you need counseling and help with mental illness. Please stop, suicide is not a solution, and I know life feels hopeless.

Do you have anyone to talk to? If not then pm me and we can talk.

The first step here is to seek professional counselling. Dm man if you need help. You have some work experience. You were just in a shitty situation. Any choice will be better than suicide. So it's better to talk The biggest privilege is we are alive and have access to unlimited information. Taking breaks is very important life. We think our life bound to our employment and we judge ourselves invariably. The truth is we are all not good at everything that we do,  its supposed to be that way but we are certainly good at something. We need to find what we like. Live our life for ourselves first and nobody else. That is when we will discover what we mean we are much more than the cubicle that we slouch in. Life is much more than a soulless job. Been depressed for about 3 years, On meds and improving. I don't have any elaborate words to teach you about life,but just wanted to say one thing. What your mind is suggesting currently is just a way to get out of all the mess, there are thousand others and maybe better ways. Hang on, it will pass. Hey at least your vocabulary is good. You'll be good at litrature try writing sometime. Nihilist Indian here as well. My mind boggles at the fact that a sizeable population of our country continues to dredge on with their meaningless life.

I have seen the people in IT, they're not useful for anything apart from projecting a really bad image of Indian IT. Many of them don't have the aptitude for it, so it's not their fault, I just feel something like the army, or B. Com. followed by the thousands of niche careers (I know a person who's into SCM, and pretty good at it, I can also imagine how shit she would be at something like coding). People mindlessly going into, medical, engineering, MBA and the institutes encouraging them to screw up their entire life for profit.

Alcohol and weed numb the pain only temporarily, my mind then again starts asking if the purpose of my life is to build something for a firangi, who can then sell it to another firangi, to get this coupons that I can exchange for a lifestyle that tries to emulate the firangis, but a low quality version of it?

I then try to convince myself that there's some redemption in living for my family, but in the end the only thing I'm achieving is the continuation of this mindless drudgery. Hey bro...dont do this...please reply...there is 288k people reading your story and worried about you...we can talk and make ur life better... believe me we can..just reply Sounds a lot like me except I have only a handful of months of work experience but that particular part doesn't bother me as I have zero interests or goals let alone the desire to build a career.

I hope you stumble upon something joyful to live for before it's too late. Am. In a government job.... Less pay and long working hours.... But i have developed hobbies and all... I read a lot and play basketball everyday... So make new passions if this one doesn't serve you well... Easy to say and all but don't give up.... This will all. One day be a learning for you... Dont give up at all.... This is the best advice I was ever given, so I will pass it on to you:

Which college to attend, whether to buy a car, should you get married or not...for any big decision in life, you should wait at least three days.

What you seem to be considering is an irreversible decision. There is no going back. Since this is a very big decision in your life, which will also affect all the friends, family and loved ones in your life, you should take at least three days to consider it.

I am not giving this advice lightly. I have been in your shoes many times, and this is the advice I take. I know you feel extremely low right now, but that feeling is not permanent. After three days, I assure you this feeling will pass. But you cannot be rash. 

I also want to explain to you that there is such as thing as brain chemistry. For people like us, certain neurotransmitters may be low. This is not anyone's fault, it is how we are. I strongly advise you to see a psychologist, and also consider seeing a psychiatrist. When you have a stomach ache, you take medicine to heal your stomach. When there is a chemical imbalance in the brain, taking medicine can drastically improve your life.

I am not a doctor, so please, go see a psychiatrist (these are people who are therapists but also have medical degrees, they are literally brain doctors) and they will help you deal with this.

You are not alone, and if you need to talk to someone feel free to DM me. Dude, I empathize with you since my life has been eerily similar to yours. I just wanted you to know that you write really well and that's something I wished I was good at. Try to use that skill. 

PM me if you would like to talk about anything. Please talk to us. Please. 

We are all here for you and we all care. If you want to vent and you want someone to listen, PM me. I won't offer advice or sympathy, but I'll listen attentively and empathetically. If you don't want that, tell me how you want us to talk and we'll do things your way, at your pace.

I would urge you to seek counselling. It isn't for the weak and the stigma around it is false. As someone who has talked to a lot of people with problems, therapy can and does help.

There is always hope. Promising that things will get better seems disingenuous, because the future is unknown. But, hope remains a constant. And, one more thing remains constant: there are always people who care. You will never trade your place in those people's hearts because your place is permanent and you are irreplaceable to them. Nothing changes that.

Please PM any one of us, myself included. Lay your expectations out and we'll be there for you in the capacity you think you want.

Edit: If anyone reading this feels like you don't have a friend you can call at 2AM, I am ex-London Nightline volunteer and am trained in handling suicide/self-harm calls, along with the heaviest of topics. Don't worry about bogging me down. PM me and I will talk. I will try to ensure that your messages reach me. Alternatively, please go to Nightline.org.uk and use their free IM service. Hey there,

if you want to talk to someone, you can PM. we can talk it over the phone. 

I can guarantee you , you are looking at this the wrong way.

Give me chance to change your mind. 

You got nothing to lose and everything to gain if you just talk to me. Think about parents. Dont leave them alone. Atleast try to live for them. First things first -- SEEK HELP. The kind of thoughts you are describing perfectly fit the clinical definition of depression. I'm sorry that you are going through this, man.

Secondly, look for opportunities that you can do to keep going for now. Since you're on reddit, I suggest looking into /r/slavelabour and other subs. The flow of money will keep you occupied and give you some financial stability and allow you to access more resources.

Lastly, connect with people who are/were in a similar situation and made it out. Hope this helps, good luck to you. Please reach out for some counselling, please think positive, lime many have suggested, you have skills you might not even realize are of great value to many. Like you English composition is way above average and something that you can tap into. Some people might say that you have nothing to loose at this juncture then why not take a risk and do something on the business /freelancing front and see how it goes. Have a positive attitude, don't worry about the world, never think people are out to judge you for what you are in life. Being a ""failure"" (your word) doesn't mean you have to give up, the whole world is out there, go do what makes you happy. You just need a good therapist bro. There are better replies here than mine, so i just hope you find peace man. Bye. OP, you need to stop doing this. Go get some basic checks done. Like thyroid etc. Sit down, make a plan, pop a modafinil every few days and go to work like a madman. You'll be better. Maybe you are not meant for computer jobs..is there anything nelse you are passionate about Try to accept pain.It may not make sense but if you’re able to channel your pain you wouldn’t go through like this.Try to think less and work more.The world is an insanely unfair place and I’m sorry that you had such a difficult life.Just do it for your parents maybe but ending it now will not account for the pain you’ve already faced.People will torture your parents and you’ll be branded useless for the remainder of your remembrance...Just for your parents go through this everyone dies at some point naturally or otherwise.Don’t do it because the moment you’re in the middle of dying you’ll regret it but you’ll not be able to undo it. If you look at the grand scheme of things, the universe doesn't really care about who has achieved how much, and who hasn't. We are all just a speck of dust in the cosmos, a blip in the timeline of the universe. So comparing ourself with other so called ""successful"" people is useless.

On the other hand, there are people in this world who are worse off than you. You at least have a job man... You were once smart, intelligent. 100/100 doesn't just happen.

I have felt the same way in life, and I know it's a shitty feeling. But that is no reason for just giving up. Once you reach rock bottom, the only direction left for you is up.

Think about it this way: Do you really want to be the reason of your parents' sadness? Or do you want to start again, and fight your way through?

Don't go by the norms of the society - So what if society thinks everyone should have a decent job? Fuck that! Make your own way, make your on goals.

Career is just one small part of your life. I don't know why everyone is so fixated on just making money. Find something that truly brings happiness.

Don't be so judgemental on yourself man, you are so young, you can  always start again. Bring back that old you that was cheerful, and smart, and dynamic. I KNOW you can.

DM me, we'll talk more. OP don't do it. You're not a failure, no you're absolutely not! My dear friend. When you read this (I sure home you do) know that you don't owe this fucking world and your parents a thing. You are not trapped even if you think you are. You have what it takes the tell the world to fuck off and make your own rules. Do not get bogged down with people's expectations of what it means to be successful. You are the only one who can define and know what makes you happy. Spend time and money on yourself. Think of what you'd miss. Pets, your favorite foods, tv series, the ability to travel, see beautiful places and faces 

I hope you see this friend. Loads of love to you. Is there any way to know if he's fine? Friends are social investments where time is the currency and a little bit of luck is the seed. You will make some and lose some. I am glad you put your thoughts here and people are helping you out. Stay strong. You need to look at the better side of things, life is not just about a job. You will get other job or can do some other things in life. I will suggest you to take total break for few days. Take 2 weeks off from work and go travel and spend time for yourself. 
Most importantly talk to people you trust and seek professional help. Hey. Seems like we're on the same boat. 

DM me ASAP. 

I talked with several people through Reddit having almost Same issues as you. I don't know I can help you or not but please let me try. I also used to and still alone and unemployed. So I think our aloneness can be togetherness. 

please don't take any unnecessary steps. If you read this, send me a DM. Let's talk. These feelings are not exclusive to you, many people have them. You need help and support, not an ""end"". I hope you get better. Please don’t take any extreme steps dude. Just read the replies here for once. Life is much more than this. Just talk to us; talk to someone and it will all feel better. People do care about you! PM me, I was in a worse situation than you but have sorted my life out. I'm sure I can show you something cool ! OP, listen to this guy. I did not get job for 4 years after engineering in my domain, then changed domain and started from scratch. Never lose hope. OP please don't do it please. It's not as hopeless as it seems to you right now. I've been there. So glad i didn't do it. So much happened and now it seems so stupid that i ever considered it. The world is huge and there are so many possibilities. Please come and talk. I'm here to talk with you, please message me. I am in the exact same situation. Also did my Engineering in Electronics and Instrumentation and my skill set sucks. No friends and nobody who gives a shit about me and I believe I'd take the same route as you in the next 4-6 years. I am saving this so I could use this in the future. First of all, you should immediately seek counselling.

Secondly, your language skills (not your strength in English, but the way you form statements and put it down) gives me an impression that you're not as dumb as you've described yourself. In fact, it shows a very well developed mind who knows how to use words and write. I just checked your post history, it shows a couple of posts in /r/WritingPrompts and also in /r/SuicideWatch. I don't know what to make of all of this. If you're not making this up, I repeat you have to seek counselling immediately. I am trying to report this post anyway. Dude, atleast you should've talked to us once before making up your mind.

I hope you're still there.

Reply to us. We will help you. Talk to your parents man. Just give them a call and  tell them about how you feel. They will surely help you out. Please don't end your life. Its ok to feel these thoughts my friend, Take care of yourself and I hope you don’t do what you intending of doing. This might be the point in your life where things finally turn around. Don't give up!!! OP you could easily pivot your career path in software testing be it Performance testing, API testing ,Selenium Automation testing etc Please think about your family before taking any decision. You going away makes matters worse for your parents.

If not about yourself, think about the driver of the truck the next time when you have such thoughts while on the street. Imagine the guilt he will live with. 

Please please talk to someone, anyone of us if you feel alone. Just went through OP's comments and posts. I am so sorry you have been facing these issues for a long time now. Hang in there, everything will be alright! Hey man ! I have been through the same and come out of it too. All I can tell is to stop comparing with others and start pushing your limit . It feels like shit for a couple of years straight (It did for me) but then I improved. I got better and realised a pattern to pushing myself. You too can do it. Don't do it. Just give life a chance. Don't have too many expectations from yourself. The purpose of life is not to be successful or happy. The purpose of life is to observe and experience it. If you can do that, be it by singing a song, reading a book or talking to a person, do it. 

Do this : If you can, go outside right now, and give 10 rupees to a beggar. If you can't find one, just try to help anyone you can, with any small act possible. Then think about the decision you were making. I’m sorry but don’t do it, there are lots of startup’s looking for different kind of people and not just engineering. I would ask you to take a vacation for yourself and think about all the good things happened in your lives. Stay strong my man. Pls listen to me, this may be a far reach but have you heard of vigyan samagam, search for it, there are 7 mega science projects and out of those 7, at least 6 or maybe all of them need instrumentation engineers who can start afresh. CGPA doesn't matter, they need actual talent which can be applied in those projects. they need people who are fresh, as in who can appreciate the physics and provide the engg skills needed for those projects. Please visit them, apply for jobs there, you may have a chance. I myself am a b.tech student, so I do know what is the placement scenario. Do not give up my mate...
Especially for your parents ....

Every other kid in India has a story exactly like you...infact you might have had a better life as you got placed into a good company...some are still looking for jobs..

The grass is always greener on the other side..
So value what you have..and maybe change your job and get some perspective before deciding anything...

I remember a similar post here from some time back...not sure if it was you..

Take it easy... Bro please reply I am scared for you. I wish I had the words that will make you feel better right away, but I don't. 

I know things might seem a little blurry right now but it will get better, just don't give up. 

If you think you are out of options, trust me ( and I've learned the hard way) there are infinite possible options that will make you feel better and motivate you to better yourself. 
I also know, that you can't think of those options right now, but I don't blame you. I just want to assure you, things can get better. 



Does anyone know if he's alright
Seriously OP if you are reading this, you need counselling, but  if you can't afford it right now,  don't hesitate to DM me, I am sure I can help you in some way, at least make you feel better. Is it possible to report this incident to some authority so as to check up on him? It’s all self pity and disdain until you see someone in a worse situation pull through and ultimately emerge victorious. If anybody knows op then please let us know why isn't he updating. Or if anyone here had a talk with him then please do let us know. I'm worrying for him. Don't do this. Trust me. 
You've forgotten what you have. 

If you could not achieve more, learn to live in less.

Job is just a small part of life. It can be changed. 

Find another passion.

There is so much more to be seen. 

Don't do it. 

Instead, kill your ego.. Read some philosophy. You will find peace. Trust me, I've been there. There isn't just one way to earn money. So many things you can do. I believe in you man! You can do great. Just focus on the right things! It's not too late! Find something in life that you like. It can be hobby  or an interest.  Job is to fill your stomach and unless you have interest in it, you will feel depressed and you need something to look forward to.. It will get better. Just talk with someone. Call your parents. Go home for sometime.
Maybe being away from family is not for you. [https://www.reddit.com/user/Snoopyrun/](https://www.reddit.com/user/Snoopyrun/)   


Please stay hopeful brother. We love you just the way you are. In the end everything will be okay if not it is not the end. Did anybody hear back from OP?  I hope he is OK. Dude do meditation and start your medication on OCD or go rehab if it helps. Join other jobs like call centre and start small fuck other people who just talk stay connected to people who provide some important info on jobs and creativity. Bring your hobbies into action it helps mentally and try to make money from it. Start trekking get close to nature and others too its good and fast money.

Life ko happy rakhna sikh lo bhai Friend, you are not defined by your failures or successes. You can turn all this around, you can be happy -- I promise. Don't give up, I beg you. We're all in this together, and you can look to others for support. 

Please don't give up. Are bhai I too feel my education has failed somewhat in logical reasoning. I'm starting small with learning pure maths and related books. I suggest you the same, it might be hard to find time but find whatever time and do it. Also.. take the meds. I am probably in a worse situation (in terms of career) than you. I am 28, with family and social situation similar to you. I have been taking exams for government jobs without success. I do not have any job experience. 
I have been depressed for so long that it feels like a part of me now. I too have suicidal thoughts almost on a daily basis. I can relate to the nihilism and OCD pattern you wrote about. I have no control over my negative thoughts. But, there are times when I feel nothing at all. 
You clearly need psychiatric help to deal with it. You should at least watch mental health related videos and talks on YouTube. 
Please, just stay strong. Here is a Frank Herbert quote that always helps me - ""The mystery of life isn't a problem to solve, but a reality to experience."" Hope you feel better soon. [deleted] [removed] Ignore the other comments.

You are making a decision that affects you and only you. 



If this means that you won't suffer anymore, then I'm happy for you.




I don't understand why the holier than thou commenters think that life is absolutely worth it.


If you are literally so broken then you don't have to go on. You can end your suffering once and for all. 


I'd rather suggest posting this on r/antinatalism or r/suicidewatch (if you're still there). They are supportive and won't bash you and force you to live just cuz bUt mUh LiFe iS a GiFt. [removed] [removed]"
438,Science/Technology,People who test negative might also have coronavirus: Study,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fywlyr/people_who_test_negative_might_also_have/,">scientists have warned about a growing concern: the tests are not 100 percent reliable, meaning people with negative results might actually have coronavirus.
-------------

>The majority of tests around the world use a technology called PCR, which detects pieces of the coronavirus in mucus samples.
-------------------
>there are a lot of things that impact whether or not the test actually picks up the virus,"" Priya Sampathkumar, an infectious diseases specialist at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, told AFP.

It depends on how much virus the person is shedding (through sneezing, coughing, and other bodily functions), how the test was collected and whether it was done appropriately by someone used to collecting these swabs, and then how long it sat in transport,"" she said.

>With 40 million people, ""even if only one percent of the population was tested, 20,000 false-negative results would be expected."" (USA)

Part of the problem lies in locating the virus as its area of highest concentration shifts within the body.

 ______ 
**India must shed intellectual colonialism to excel in science and technology** 

 ______ 
There is a major power imbalance in the world, which comes from the language
that dominates the world of discovery, innovation, and science and technology.
Today, that language is English. The intellectual domination of the West comes
from the building of communities whose power comes from their deep connection
with their native language. The language which they use to think, dream and
shape the world is their own. This results in ideas that can change the world.
If you do not use or have a mastery over your native language in science and
technology, then, mere facility makes you a great follower and never a leader.

While overthrowing political and economic colonialism, we have failed to
overthrow intellectual colonialism. In making English the sole language of
intellectual discourse in science and technology in India, we have lost on
many fronts. First, exceptions aide, as a community even our best institutions
can never lead globally if English is the only language of high-level
intellectual discourse. Our best minds will merely be eloquent paraphrasers of
the ideas of others. Second, we close opportunities in intellectual leadership
to huge sections of our population. In other words, as intellectuals we cannot
be the best in the world. In addition to this, we lock the doors to even the
second- level positions we occupy as elites. One of the many consequences of
this is a poor connection of professional leadership with our society. Thus,
we fail in being great intellectuals, we exclude and do not share a sense of
purpose for society. In turn, our society responds to this elitism by
undervaluing learning and the intellectual enterprise.

There have been many examples of countries which have successfully addressed
the twin-challenges of developing communities of intellectual leaders in
science and technology and are yet deeply rooted in using their native
language for churning ideas. In Germany, science students would have had their
principal language as German and yet be fluent in English. Many of the best
German labs are international and the language of discourse may well be in
English, yet, the advantage that comes from the ability that German scientists
have to think in their native language, in the most advanced scientific
subjects, is not small. Conversely, no country, including India, that has
chosen English as its primary language of scientific discourse, ignoring its
local languages, has become an intellectual powerhouse.

Whenever there is a discussion on this subject, two arguments are made against
university education in one’s native language. The first is that English is
necessary in today’s world, which is valid. The answer is not to diminish
English, but to enhance the use of one’s native language at every level. The
second argument is that the task is impossible to implement. This argument is
both a cop-out and false. It is a cop-out because not taking this up forever
makes us an intellectual vassal-state, while maintaining an elite that is both
dysfunctional and disinterested. The argument is false because the task is
entirely feasible with focus and investment.

What, then, is to be done? Currently, the bulk of our college education in
science and technology is notionally in English whereas the bulk of our high-
school education is in the local language. Science courses in college are thus
accessible largely to the urban population and even when this happens,
education is effectively, neither of quality in English nor communicated as
translations of quality in the classroom. Starting with the Kendriya
Vidyalayas and the Nayodya Vidyalayas as test-arenas, we can ensure the
training of teachers so that students in high-school are simultaneously taught
in both their native language and in English. This already happens informally,
but its needs formalisation. The student should be free to take exams in
either language or indeed use a free-flowing mix. This approach should be
steadily ramped up and used in all our best educational institutions in
college and then scaled to be used more widely. Public and private colleges,
in STEM subjects, for example, can lead and make bi-lingual professional
education, attractive and economically viable. Technology, can of course
assist implementation, but the primary driver is a will to change.

Our international partners envy the facility many Indians have with English.
Without losing this, we must also have the ability to think deeply about
complex and difficult subjects at the level of the best in the world. This can
come only when communities in Rajasthan, Kerala or Odisha can wield, in their
minds, their respective languages in the frontier areas of science the way in
which the French, the Dutch or the Germans do. We should not conflate the use
of English as the vehicle for communication and commerce with the use of
language as the basis for the power of ideas.

I know & respect Dr Vijayaraghavan immensely, but this is just bollocks. We don't spend sufficiently on education (primary & higher education), what exists is a rat race for 'marks' & not learning, and on top of that, we spend a pittance on research. What little we do has been captured in most institutes by entrenched interests. Let's fix all that and then talk about language.

I'm saying that as a supporter for having the first few years of primary education in the mother tongue."
440,Science/Technology,Calculus created in India 250 years before Newton: study - Technology & Science,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/calculus-created-in-india-250-years-before-newton-study-1.632433,," Awesome! I read about this sometime back, but it was speculation and not the conclusion of a study then.

Anyone interested in reading viewpoints such as of these researchers should read The Indian Clerk, a book about Ramanujan and his time in England. People are arguing that the Taylor series was proof of invention of calculus. Bitch pls. Be proud if you want to but get your facts right.

While I understand that the Taylor series is a very important concept in calculus, it isn't necessary to combine the ideas of infinitesimal sums and differences, convergence, divergence and limits to get to it. The form newton and leibnitz fought over inventing was one which had these concepts (as evidenced by newton promptly using it for his kinematics work).

So no, in the true sense, I wouldn't call this the invention of calculus. But it's an absolutely important step there nonetheless... something which neither newton nor leibnitz had set eyes on, so careful before you start accusing them of plagiarizing.  These are REAL Indian achievements. I have no idea why the wingnuts insist on tom-tomming the Taj as a Shiv mandir when there actually are real things to be proud of.  Really, this is new? I thought Madhava and the taylor series has been known for a quite a while now. Newton wasn't even the 1st European to develop the calculus.  A better title would be ""Medieval scientists in Kerala invented Infinite Series centuries before the West"".

This is indeed admirable, but please do remember that calculus isn't just about infinite series, the concept of limits, infinitesimal small changes and their infinite sums is crucial. Infinite series is just one part of the stepping stones to calculus.

Regardless, this is definitely something to be proud about. It's interesting to see proper research into the Indian history of the maths, sciences and economics; since this is severely lacking in our narratives of history. However, using clickbaity headlines is a bit disingenuous, but to be expected. It is a 2007 article, going by the date.

>""There were many reasons why the contribution of the Kerala school has not been acknowledged,"" he said. ""A prime reason is neglect of scientific ideas emanating from the Non-European world, a legacy of European colonialism and beyond.""

>However, he concedes there are other factors also in play.

>""There is also little knowledge of the medieval form of the local language of Kerala, Malayalam, in which some of most seminal texts, such as the Yuktibhasa, from much of the documentation of this remarkable mathematics is written,"" he admits.

I think Mr Gevarghese George, who sounds like an Indian, has got his primes mixed up. The Brits were rather interested in what we had discovered and what we believed, if the Journal of the Asiatic Society is anything to go by. I would say that the prime reason is what he accepts as 'other factors', something for which the blame lies squarely at our own feet.

I think we have done much more than just this - in Advanced Mathematics and Astronomy. And then let it all go to seed ... This is mentioned in Wikipedia. 

>In the 14th century, Indian mathematician Madhava of Sangamagrama and the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics stated components of calculus such as the Taylor series and infinite series approximations. However, they were not able to combine many differing ideas under the two unifying themes of the derivative and the integral, show the connection between the two, and turn calculus into the powerful problem-solving tool we have today

The researcher of this article is George Gheverghese Joseph from Kerala. 

 V INVANTED CALCULUSS [removed] Shocked that I haven't seen a **so prod v invant** comment here so far. 

Anyway, now that Western scientists have put this matter to rest, I am sure our fellow randians are convinced. Otherwise we would have seen a bunch of disparaging comments about the people who say anything along these lines. Secular feathers will be ruffled. Kya ukhaad liya calculus invent karke Everytime someone comes out with statements like this (especially if they are right), the natural question that arises is - then what the f*** are we doing with our garbage heap of an education system, rote learning, utter absence of creativity, and spectacles like a daytime drama queen (literally) as the person in charge of education, chokehold of bureaucracy, anaemic support for higher education, and research (0.7% vs. 3% of GDP that all of our competitors have)? It must have been invented we had a very skilled and glorious past. Even scientists today r baffled by indian architecture which was created in past. The ashoka pillar is the iron pillar standing in open since years without any rust, and taj mahal ajanta ellora paintings etcetc. But sad truth is today we are a third world country with poverty population explosion and corruption. Just coz ur father was a rich n successfull businessman doesnt mean u keep on doing nothing and encash on his name hope this is clear Not sure, why we always want to compare our civilization with western one. Seems like we still have the inferiority complex because western one ruled over us. 

We know  India is one of the oldest and great civilization. A lot of was discovered and invented in India. But can we focus on how what we are today. Even if Calculus was created in India, no one can deny that Leibniz, Newton and western civilization reinvented it, documented it, promoted it, applied it and made it part of math curriculum. 

So even if India  created calculus, stop finding reasons for how great we were, and discuss on how can be great today.
 Calculus is INDIAN^Mlecch_Certified where is the anti kulcha people now Doesn't matter, because Issac Newton was Indian too. He was kidnapped from Yamuna vaidhshalaya (university) and brainwashed by white people. His real name was Isayu Nathuram. Look it up on Subramanian Swamy's facebook page if you don't beleive me. So we inveneted calculus either way. so prod of r kulcha Doesn't matter. Issac Newton (Ishant Nutan) was actually of Indian origin. His father had emigrated from India.  That is why his father forced Ishant to learn Sanskrit which was responsible for Ishant creating Calculus. ITT : not history not a lot of math, does not compute at all."
441,Science/Technology,"‘The most terrifying moments’: India counts down to risky Moon landing | If touchdown is successful, Chandrayaan-2 will be the first lunar mission to explore the south pole.",https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02587-4,," Fingers crossed! but I am sure it will be successful. Wishing all the very best to ISRO! For people asking why ISRO is doing this:

We need to explore moon to find if we can set up a base. So that it will be like a pitstop for deep space missions. To escape earths gravity we need more fuel. But moon's gravity is very weak so we can carry more fuel and more cargo.

To set up the base we need to find if we have sufficient water and other essential minerals. Also to check if we can extract rocket fuel, so that we don't have to transport from earth. 

For ISRO along with all this, it's the first step in sending Landers and rovers for deep space missions like Mars. Sending rovers and landers to moon is relatively cheap compared to Mars if it fails. So they are doing it step by step.

Edit: Thank you kind stranger for my first silver.

Edit: Why we need to do Deep Space exploration:

Because we have such a big universe with so much energy and resources. We are fighting for limited energy and resources here, but if we could tap into the energy and resources of the whole universe including our own sun by building a Dyson Sphere, we will have unlimited clean energy. Then all the climate change problem, everything can be solved in an instance. We already have technology to convert carbon dioxide air into solid carbon but we are not doing it everywhere because energy requirement is high.

If you go back in history, the last dominant species of Earth Dinosaur died when an astroid hit, because they were not technologically mature. We have the technology to track astroid, but it's too difficult to find all astroids in the dark space. It may not be the astroid that will end the human species it may be something else, so to change our fate we need to explore to find a new home. For that deep space exploration is important. Also we as a species are explorers that is why we have colonised the whole earth, next step is the solar system (May be Mars and Titan-One of the Jupiter's Moon)

If something were to happen to earth it's impossible to save everyone at least with the current technology, but we can definitely save the human race. Here is the thing about space exploration: if you aren't doing it yourself, down the line you will have to pay exorbitantly to someone who did. It's simple as that.

If isro wasn't doing its thing all this while, we would've been paying some other countries to launch our satellites and stuffs, military tech and for million other reasons.

So if you are questioning why it's important to explore moon and other places, it's not for you. Maybe it's for the next generation, or the one after that. Or 10 generations from now.

Do we owe it to them? Hell yeah! Why? Because whatever shits we are enjoying right now wasn't created in our own generation with our resources, and so onus is on us to be not Dicks and handicap future generations. *Mereko aisa dhak dhak sa horela hai* *Bhai lund kara de, 500₹ extra le lena* Thanks for posting an article from Nature instead of garbage news sites. The lander of chandrayann 2 named 'Vikram' will land on lunar surface on 7th of September when its rover 'Pragyan' will roll out from 'Vikram' to carry out experiments on the lunar surface for a period of one lunar day which is equal to 14 earth days.The lander has already left the orbiter and is descending toward the moon's surface. I wish everything will come out well as most of the citizens have set their hopes on this mission and their hopes and expectations will do wonders. Fingers crossed. Since I am seeing a lot of negative comments on why we are doing this,  Wouldn't it be better to use this money on education / other things. 

Dude, this is not much money. And education and other things already have budget allowance. We aren't even using that money optimally, so throwing money to other things is not an answer. 


Also, what do you want from our high iq scholars? Work in banks or become IAS instead of becoming scientist, or migrate to NASA? Which most of them are already doing. You want to stop brain drain and want those NASA scientists to return to India, but don't want create jobs for them. 

Also, our satellite and space data can predict cyclones, weather and other things. Should we shut down isro? 


We spend more on Mayawati statues, cricket stadiums and politicians foreign trips then on isro. So the reality is, ISRO budget is not enough, and we need to increase it to support science. ""terrifying"" ???

Why is this word being misused in many chandrayaan articles. Who is being terrified/terrorised and frightened ?

It gives the impression that the scientists are just blindly doing things without confidence, hoping that it touches down. Or Like a student who has not not studied at all & appearing for exams

A more suitable word could be challenging, suspense etc.. Astronomy noob here. Please elaborate what's the context of exploring South Pole? Moon's South Pole or Earth's South Pole? All the children in the comments who are arguing whether this mission is needed or not, it's adorable. Fingers crossed. If they lose contact,just tell tapsee pannu to switch the control system on and off once. /s

All the best! A major question in the comment section is how will space exploration help common people or why is space exploration necessary. Here's my two cents

Space exploration is the pinnacle of science and technology. It is the region where we push the frontiers of knowledge, wisdom. Why push stuff you ask? Because pushing is what generates something new. It's about creating a necessity which then causes inventions. Our cameras, computers, batteries, jet fuels, propulsion systems etc all of them are direct beneficiaries of space exploration. Satellites are behind internet, TV, GPS, cellular network. Not even one of those is dispensable.

Parker probe (the one sent to sun) necessitated the invention of materials that could withstand huge thermal loads. Mars rover would eventually result in more efficient helicopters. Coming to this particular mission, the landing site is unexplored. ANY finding there is going to result in better understanding of our universe.

Speaking of purely monetary terms, ISRO launches satellites of other nations which brings profits. The reliability to price ratio of ISRO is very high which brings many customers.

Take out all of this. Space exploration provides employment.  The money spent on a rocket is not going to waste, it is going back into economy and coming back to the government too in the name of taxes. 

If you can think of ANY other field that could provide inspiration and employment to millions, better our understanding of universe, push for a better technology, be my guest. You know it's scientifically important af if Nature is covering it. Full power to the mission control team and everyone involved. This has been a wonderful project that has really put is out there as one of the stronger nations when it comes to space exploration. Hope it all works out well and we are able to execute all that has been planned for the mission. Godspeed and Jai Hind! It carries the hopes of more than 1.3 billion people. I hope it's a success [for interested people](https://imdb.com/title/tt1772240/). It involves lunar south pole. On 7th September, India will be the first nation to land a machine and study the south pole on Moon. Moon is the 1st step for the interplanetary human civilization of the near future. 1st Moon, then Mars and the NEO asteroids, then the belt - it will unlock unimaginable wealth for mankind. The cost of space exploration is going down with advanced technology. Hopefully, in the near future we would be able to remove our polluting industries and mining to space to make the earth and the ocean pristine again. Best of luck ISRO. Asking out of curiosity, why doesn't India has a ISS lab / module ? Why is it suddenly ""If touchdown is successful""? Have we lost faith in ISRO already? Let's not be so pessimistic. Hope for the success! Veery very true that Indians are unique and doing awesome things with this unique ness The opening words are  ""countless setbacks and delays"". Not sure if that is entirely true. I really never understood the purpose of such mission.

I mean why they want to  explore moon, for water and minerals ? But why ...isn't earth is enough for discovering that. 

Why we need water on moon, we can't civilise million of people like earth ,and even if we find minerals what can we do with it. Like mining them.  ? Is that easy.. economical. It's extremely difficult and I don't think it's economical too

People want to occupy Mars, i never understood why we need Mars. 

We have on earth sufficient minerals and forests , we just failed to properly exploit it without affecting environment.

Millions of people are dying of hunger and many diseases, education has pathetic standards.

For me it's just a show off thing , so that we can show off to rich nation that we also can do same. But we failed to understand Europe USA Japan China are far more developed than India, it's like hobby for them to explore moon Mars Saturn with extra pile of cash.

We have far more important problems than mere spending money on useless mission, it's okay we do such mission when we get developed fairly well then it makes sense 


Health, environment pollution, disaster management , sustainable energy are to be focused more and we need more research on these issues. 

We are spending millions of dollars on finding water on moon , while millions of people don't get water on earth.

Thanks for downvotes  😇 #sillymilestone Can we navigate this unmanned object to the location of the US Flag and debunk the Moon conspiracy once and for all? Please? So, India is going to explore the South pole of the moon.  I bet they find a bunch of dirt, rock, no trees, no grass, no life.  WOW big science."

I'm as much of a BJP detractor as anyone you'll find. But at the same time, there are a few things I know:

* Yoga has legit benefits

* Meditation is known to change thought patterns. Legit shit.

* Not all ayurveda is quackery. Head over to /r/nootropics and read about how different ayurvedic herbs act as nootropics. Sure, it won't save you from cancer, but some of this stuff has benefits. 


Nothing wrong with studying any of these in detail. Ministry of Pseudoscience Excellent use of state resources.

I just put my fingerprint in, held my phone next to the machine and it read the card. All I had to do was insert the pin and I was done. Waiter didn't react much, probably because he was tired. 

2: I used it at a gelato shop. Same POS machine. The cashier said that they don't support mobile payments (lol). I asked them to hand the machine to me, held my phone next to it and boop. It worked. He was super impressed and had this big grin after the transaction.

 I will forever be grateful to BJP if they let Hinduism alone. But who am I kidding?  But 2002!

Modi's haters will keep scaremongering about how he will start an orgy of Muslim blood and destroy India.

And whenever he proves them wrong(which is always) they will desperately go back and rake up 2002 again.

This will be their fate for the remainder of their natural lives. They will still be talking about 2002 in 2052. Fuck the elections. You want to see who wins? See who's the friendliest towards the West. Which almost always means they ignore the people. The US has all of their telemarketers and troubleshooters here, they dump all their plastic garbage not far from Chennai, and we provide Trillions in education money and then we stay back there to fill their coffers. 

Meanwhile ours is rapidly a dumping ground of the dregs of the human gene pool. The intelligent procreate less, or emigrate, therefore they will be evolved out of the gene pool.

Basically we're fucked whoever we vote for. So, get yours, or kill everyone in your way. Chances are, you're killing someone stupid. [deleted]"
450,Science/Technology,Latest Indian Innovations and Funding Opportunities to Combat COVID-19,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fygqpd/latest_indian_innovations_and_funding/,"The untapped potential of Indian youngsters is coming to light through various funding opportunities and contests organized by the Government of India. Let us look into some more innovative measures around our country to tackle this COVID-19 scenario.

###### Affordable Diagnostic Kits

[Bione](https://www.bione.in/), a Biotech startup in Bangalore, has designed a kit for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 from the comfort of our home. The kit approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research ([ICMR](https://www.icmr.nic.in/)), promises to give the diagnosis result within 5 – 10 minutes.

Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology ([IIT](http://www.iitd.ac.in/)) Delhi have also come up with a rapid diagnostic kit to detect the virus. The kit developed at Kusuma School of Biological Sciences is currently undergoing clinical trials at the National Institute of Virology ([NIV](http://www.niv.co.in/)) in Pune. Innovations in test kits will bring down the cost of testing and also give results within a short time-frame.

###### Bag-valve masks as Ventilators

Bag-valve masks are hand-held inflatable devices to support breathing in critical conditions. Professors from IIT Hyderabad have come up with a similar design that works with power from an electrical source, such as a car battery. The device is cheap, easy to manufacture and portable.

Professor Murty and Professor V. Eswaran from the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at IIT-Hyderabad, say,” the device could be manufactured for less than Rs 5,000, or one-hundredth the cost of a conventional machine.”

###### Portable Multi-feed Oxygen Manifold (MOM)

Vishakhapatnam’s Naval Dockyard personnel have found an innovative solution to meet the demand of ventilators to [treat COVID-19](https://www.intepat.com/blog/patent/the-global-patent-race-for-covid-19-vaccine/) infected patients. The MOM contains a six-way radial header fitted to one cylinder. This portable innovation can supply oxygen to six patients with one oxygen cylinder. MOM is an effective way to treat patients with limited resources available.

###### Herbal Sanitizers

Washing hands frequently can prevent the spread of COVID-19. All countries are stressing the importance of washing hands to keep ourselves safe from infection. The cost and demand for personal hygiene products have shot up around the country.

Students from IIT-Roorkee have prepared herbal sanitizers to promote personal hygiene. The sanitizers meet the regulations of [WHO](https://www.who.int/) and the US government health research institute (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/)).

###### Disinfectant Tunnel

A water treatment company in Tirupur, Tamilnadu has designed a disinfectant tunnel that can disinfect people as we walk through it. This portable tunnel is about 16-feet, made of stainless steel and fitted into a mild steel frame.

###### Arogya Setu and Corona Kavach App

The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the Union Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology have collaborated to develop a COVID-19 exposure risk tracking applications. The beta version of these Apps will be of use to track if the user has any exposure to coronavirus patients. These Apps will track the user’s location and alert them if they come across a person who was tested positive for the virus.

##### Innovation Contests and Funding Events

Several government agencies and private sector companies have come forward to encourage and support innovations and designs developed to tackle the COVID-19 crisis.

###### COVID-19 Solution Challenge

The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has launched this challenge to involve active community participation around the country. The challenge is accepting solutions to help fight COVID-19. The best solutions that could be adopted in real life will be rewarded. The contest will give away prizes totaling to 1,75,000 INR.

The last date to [participate](https://innovate.mygov.in/covid19/) is 16 April 2020.

###### United Against COVID-19-Innovation Challenge

The department for the promotion of industry and internal trade (DPIIT) with Startup India has announced an open call for all companies, startups, and innovators to offer solutions that can bridge the gap between the demand and supply of medical requirements used in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of COVID-19. The contest encourages innovators to work on med-tech, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and the Internet of Things, to come up with ideas, prototypes, and designs to combat COVID-19.

The deadline for [entries](https://www.startupindia.gov.in/content/sih/en/ams-application/challenge.html?applicationId=5e79126ee4b055bfaea9ef66) is 15 April 2020.

###### Challenge COVID-19 Competition (C3)

National Innovation Foundation – India (NIF), an autonomous body under the Department of Science and Technology – India has [announced](http://nif.org.in/challenge-covid-19-competition) a competition to find solutions to the most pressing problems in the COVID-19 scenario.

The C3 encourages innovations to reduce virus transmission, improve sanitizing facilities and enhance door delivery options for the elderly. Currently, the contest is accepting entries on a rolling application basis.

###### Centre for Augmenting War with COVID-19 Health Crisis (CAWACH)

The Indian Ministry of Science and Technology has formed the [CAWACH](https://isba.in/cawach/) to identify and support innovations of startups working on the novel, safe and affordable respiratory devices, personal protective equipment, diagnostics, and any other innovation to control and treat the spread of COVID-19. The Centre is equipped with funds amounting to 56 Crore and plans to identify 50 such innovations and take them to the next level.

Many State Governments have also come up with challenges motivating students, startups, innovators around the country to come up with innovative solutions to face this health crisis. The optimistic and encouraging environment is an ideal platform for budding innovators.

Today marks our 71st Republic day. It's been an [annual tradition of sorts](https://internetfreedom.in/a-republic-day-letter-from-iff/) at IFF to use this occasion to reflect and also indicate what small role we hope to play in support of our constitutional ideals.

## India stands on the edge of a technological precipice

Over a year, IFF's work has strengthened on the basis of the generosity and support of many volunteers, collectives and organizations. In many ways  our advocacy has merely been a top-dressing to a richer foundation prepared with the time and labor of others. Today our mission is stronger both in our ability to do our work and cause impact due to these networks of sharing.

To  cause change over the last year IFF has done substantial institutional  engagement on issues ranging from net neutrality, free expression,  privacy and innovation. These are publicly documented on the website and  I invite you to go through them. As we grow capacity, our work will  become more technology, campaign and public centered. This is not to  say, there have not been attempts over the past year. IFF has become  better at collaborations with other individuals and organizations  primarily in the fields of community building and public talks. We would  like to believe we are contributing to greater partnership in the  domains of design, law and computer sciences which are talking to each  other more regularly than ever before.

We  have tried to swiftly respond when citizen needs have arisen on issues  such as intermediary liability, malware hacks, surveillance drones,  facial recognition and internet shutdowns. This has been followed up  with persistent representations, RTIs and even court challenges. Our  greater realization is that much of this work interacts with Government  institutions. It often requires a fresh set of regulations and by its  very nature the results are tangibly felt in the medium to long term. To  accelerate timelines, one of IFF's missions has to be to complement the  power of movements with building resilient organizational capacity.

Financial  sustainability is vital to make such policy victories a practised reality. We have approached fundraising and our expenses with, civic  legitimacy, discipline and transparency (*transparency is major component of our website re-design that will roll out in May, 2020*).  We have focused on implementing a model of individual giving and  recurring donations that provides five membership tiers and receives  funds only from Indians. These have helped us achieve a marginal level  of predictability in fund flows and a continuous channel of feedback and  co-ownership. All of this is a process of iteration and learning.

We  need to do more to come close to our projected revenue targets that are  accommodated by the generous buffer provided by organizational donors.  Many of them have donated to IFF after learning about our work through  our members who have championed our cause to their management. We are  thankful to each one of them, for helping us do our work independently  and even providing us an opportunity to have conversations with them to  explore how digital rights can help improve user trust in their  products.

Today, donations help fund 3 staffers, an off-counsel. Soon 2 more people will be hired to ""*secure*""   the values of the Indian constitution as put forth in the Preamble.  All IFF volunteers, staff and leadership are guided by a sense of  urgency, recognizing that each day is a call to action to defend your  liberty, equality, fraternity and justice in our digital republic. Dr.  B. R. Ambedkar, put it best, just before the Preamble was put to vote  and adopted, “*I say that this  Preamble embodies what is the desire of every member of the House that  this Constitution should have its root, its authority, its sovereignty,* ***from the people***. ***That it has***.”

We are committed to serving everyday Indians like you.

If you would like to support our mission in 2020, I invite you to[ become a IFF Member](https://internetfreedom.in/donate/) today.

Apar Gupta, Executive Director"," Thank you for starting this effort. I hope everyone contributes. More than anything else I’m happy that people are contributing. It shows that they are some people out there who give a damn about what this government is trying to do with data. Thank you for this. Good luck with the contributions. Can someone add a general tag for the sub I'm tired of hate and protests Appreciate the effort to raise awareness about and improve privacy, among other things, in a country where *WhatsApp from Facebook®* permeates the digital realm.

Another topic I have strong (negative) opinions on is pornography, and since www is the most popular medium for it, I decided to look up IFF's stance on it and found a couple of relevant articles that I'd like to comment on here since there is no ability to do so on the site itself.

* By the way, is the ability to comment on articles being considered for the upcoming revamped website? Perhaps this would fall under ""feedback and co-ownership"" mentioned here.
* Along with the publish dates of articles, it'd be good to see the author's name somewhere as well to be able to compare their views over time in different pieces. It's not exactly clear from the positions listed on the [About page](https://internetfreedom.in/about/) who the editor is.

Following quotes are from [https://internetfreedom.in/porn-is-complex-we-call-for-further-study/](https://internetfreedom.in/porn-is-complex-we-call-for-further-study/):

>While porn is problematic for a multitude of reasons \[...\], the principal regulation in India for it originates from victorian sensibilities. 

&#x200B;

>Why should our lives be governed by British era laws on obscenity? Help us fight victorian sensibilities in 2020.

&#x200B;

>It criminalises healthy adult behaviours and represses desire.

&#x200B;

>More worryingly existing criminal provisions on obscenity are being used for criminalising political dissent.

All are unsubstantiated claims presented as facts.

* How was it concluded that porn regulations in India come from ""British era laws"" or ""Victorian sensibilities"" (I'm assuming the ""v"" was intended to be capitalized)? AFAIK, they were only blocked in the past few years, and if anything, Victorian influence on India and its people would be decreasing over time. Are you saying that porn would've been a-ok in the society of pre-colonial India? The language used here seems rather manipulative to me.
* ""healthy adult behaviours and represses desire"": so, the thousands of years that humans spent without pornography were unhealthy and repressed?
* ""criminal provisions on obscenity being used to criminalize political dissent"": I'd be really interested in seeing an instance where political dissent was *criminalized.* Did it mean to say suppressed? Would still like to see where that happened.

On to [https://internetfreedom.in/why-is-porn-being-blocked-in-india-whattheblock/](https://internetfreedom.in/why-is-porn-being-blocked-in-india-whattheblock/):

>Finally, we recognize the concerning psychological impact of porn production and consumption but we do believe that when viewed privately, it falls within an individual’s right to free speech and privacy. This certainly does not include pornography which has minors present in it, or is created in the absence of consent. To make and view pornography belonging to both these classes is not only a crime, but a deep moral stain that results in long lasting physical and mental harm to the participants who are exploited for its production.

Minor meaning physically under 18? How would you determine that from watching a video? What about cases where an actor is physically an adult but lacks somehow in their mental capacity? Would their consent really count? What about videos where all involved individuals are adult and consenting to the act, but are unaware of being recorded (so, a lack of consent there) but it's not apparent in the video. I've personally come across such cases IRL, and on the web.

>We acknowledge that the ethics of mainstream porn production, particularly the portrayal of women and other minorities, merit study and examination.  
>  
>At present, we maintain that pornography production requires greater diversity and strict enforcement.  
>  
>These are issues beyond the scope of our expertise and we look for leadership from feminist and sex workers’ rights organisations

""other minorities""? ""greater diversity""? Feminist leadership to deal with porn related issues?  It's sort of ironic that both articles complain about British/Colonial/Victorian influence in India *in 2020* (!). Why admit that these subjects are beyond the scope of IFF but then push for porn when it's apparent that there are many issues surrounding it.

>IFF will do what it does best, which is fight for internet freedom and the choice of individual internet users in India. This includes the private consumption of content that is deemed obscene under antiquated, colonial laws which should not find space in modern, progressive India.

The content is ""deemed obscene"" even in modern Western world, let alone India, which is why there are 18+ age confirmations on the porn websites. If it weren't deemed obscene, you wouldn't need the ""private"" in there, so the statement contradicts itself, really."

455,Science/Technology,Chandrayaan Moon Landing,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d0ffgv/chandrayaan_moon_landing/,"ISRO's Chandrayaan 2 mission is a significant technological event that has kept space watchers in India and across the world riveted. The mission to land an Indian lander and rover on the moon's surface was launched on 22nd July, 2019. 

Chandrayaan carries two modules designed to work independently, Vikram, the lander, and Pragyan, the lunar rover. 

The landing module, comprising the lander and rover, has separated from the orbiter and will begin its descent on to lunar terrain shortly post midnight.

**Edit I: (7th September)**


Communications with the landing module were lost while it was around 2.1km from the surface. 

Failures in space exploration are disappointing and expensive - but are inevitable (and one could argue essential for eventual success.) 

To space enthusiasts; keep the chins up - the orbiter lives - and will hopefully fulfill its mission objectives in full. 

**Edit II: (8th September)**

The Chandrayaan orbiter has found the exact location of the lander on the lunar surface. 

ISRO confirms that a thermal image of the lander has been taken. The Chandrayaan 2 team will investigate the reasons for the loss of communication with the lander using signal data.

There is no information on the state or condition of the lander yet.

[Hotstar](https://www.hotstar.com/chandrayaan-2-live/1260009955) Hosted by Gaurav Kapur, Chandrayaan 2's landing on the moon will stream live from ISRO Command Centre and our Mumbai studio. A panel of global and Indian experts, led by NASA astronaut Jerry Linenger, will share their insights on this historic mission. 

[Space & Universe \(Official\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZiJMW5AdHY)

[Everyday Astronaut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQyV2WGmvOs)"," At the ISRO press conference Did you guys hear the angry journalist barking "" where is the chairman, why is he not facing the press"".... As if he has fled away after a scam. Such a scumbag. Ok so some retards are already out with ""wAstAge of PublIc rEsoUrces iN a CountrY oF PoVerTy"" rhetoric, here's the thing.  
  
Total mission cost was 900 cr, a minuscule portion of total budget  
  
India doesn't actually spend that much money on the space program. BJP spent 27000 cr on their 2019 election campaign.  
 
India's space program actually helps in alleviating poverty, by creating jobs, by helping farmers and fishermen by tracking weather activities, by educating poor people through EDUSat etc. It is so painful to watch the ISRO chairman crying. No matter what is the outcome, I will stand by with ISRO, and I will fight internet battles on their behalf, fuck anyone who thinks ISRO is not competent enough. Or perhaps we've just forgotten that we are still pioneers. And we've barely begun. And that our greatest accomplishments cannot be behind us, because our destiny lies above us.

A quote form INTERSTELLAR [removed] What makes it all the more hard to swallow is that the country has (naively)   come to expect a near perfect track record from ISRO 

Sometimes its easy to forget that what we're experimenting with is quite literally ""Rocket Science "" Getting a nation full of people who say space programs are a waste of money to be glued to their TV sets at 2 am in the morning is an achievement in itself. 

ISRO has just inspired a lot of young minds to take up space science as a field of interest. 

Instead of youth saying I want to work at NASA, we might find them saying I want to work for ISRO.

Wake up Vikram. You have a lot more people to inspire. :) [deleted] That journalist Pallava Bagla was a complete asshole for being so rude at the press conf Well done, ISRO!  The lander didn’t work out, but you’re still in orbit, and collecting data.  That’s a big win in itself.  Your flag will be on the surface soon enough. One kid is literally asking how to become President Personally I’m still hopeful. All the banter, name calling and vitriol aside, Godforbid if communication doesn’t get restored, you guys should really be proud of the monumental and prolonged effort and skill that went into reaching as far as you have reached. This is no small feat for a nation. Every moment of this mission has provided your scientists valuable information. Information that which was not handed to you by another country. These sort of attempts contribute in building a culture of making attempts in previously uncharted territory. We all know success greets those who make attempts. Everybody who tries something for the 1st time will be at a disadvantage, learning from it is where it’s at. Success after such setbacks is sweetest and much more meaningful. Imagine how many Indian kids in school will be inspired. Imagine how many more Indian young adults will be part of the next mission. That is how you teach a nation to dream big. Having ambitions that traverse petty human squabbles is what gives a nation its future. Today *is* a historic day for you all. It’s another chapter added to the story of India. 15-20 years from now many of you will be sharing with your kids the story of today. Be proud guys Did anyone else see the short de-briefing? The journalists absolutely hounded the speaker because the Chairperson didn't show up. Why should they act like this? [2019 so far](https://i.imgur.com/sVOzjat.png) Goosebumps moment when Pragyan's tyre tracks showed the National Emblem. I mean in the animated video explaining Pragyan's mission.

Edit: It's there in ISRO YT channel. Did a kid just ask a question about reservation? Dear scientists, we are proud of you.  🇮🇳 Space is tough. Only the Vikram has failed, the orbiter mission was successful. That too, it has lost contact. It might set back our manned moon mission a bit because this is what ISRO was trying, a soft landing. I'm sure there will be another mission soon. GG. Damn Chief do not cry. You did the best! Hopefully this teaches people that failures are part of life and should be accepted. FAWAD CHAUDHARY TAKES A DIG ON ISRO!


What an absolute cunt of a guy he is. People on the pakistani sub are also embarrassed by his lack of ingenuity.

There have been other Pakistani trolls who now see this as an opportunity to confront India. Let's make this clear, it has nothing to do with politics, its just jealousy, and hatred that can be seen embedded in their hearts.

One Pakistani guy replied to a post mocking India's achievement saying:

>***The thing is dusron ki nakamyabi pe khush hone wale log mujhe mentally healthy nahi lagte hain. Chahe koi bhi ho india k ho ya Pak k ya world me kahin k bhi. Jo bat hai so hai***

>Dear folks who are reacting to a senior Pakistan Minister’s tasteless comments on ISRO. Please don’t respond to him. He’s behaving like a troll. Poor man stayed up all night to watch the moon mission. Their India obsession continues. We don’t have to obsess in return

A lot of other people have flooded his post with lip-smacking replies that would have made him reflect on his lack of judgment.

This also goes to us, as an Indian, as a citizen of a mature nation, we must not indulge in blatant mockery of anyone just out of bitter spite and envy. I know for a fact that the intellectual elite in Pakistan would not stoop down to this level, but seeing a Federal Minister for Science & Technology gives me a sense of incertitude. Feel bad for K Sivan. His voice was literally shaking. Bollywood: Chaand sifarish jo karta hamari deta wo tumko btaa...

ISRO: We'll get his personal statement just hang on. Bruh I am legit feeling bad for the scientists. I have a question. Doesn't orbiter have a camera attached to it? Can't it show what actually happened to the lander? 

PS dont know much about it, was just speculating.
But literal chills. So proud!! To the people who are calling it a technology demonstration, it is not exactly a technology demonstration. Chandrayaan 1 was more of technology demonstration even though it had some good payloads. 

Chandrayaan 2 is not a technology demonstration. The orbiter is carrying many payloads and is a full fledged lunar mission in itself on par with either ESA or NASA. 

The lander too has some good payloads and the landing mission is in and itself one of the engineering target.

I've worked on the rover movement. The rover is the closest to a technology demonstration even though it carries a couple of payloads. If landing on moon was this hard for a lander, just imagine landing 3 people on moon and that too in fucking 1969 and bringing them back home safely...

How the fuc... Neil DeGrasse Tyson speaking live on Times Now. Never expected him to see on Indian television If Kerbal Space Program has taught me anything, it is to try again. Learn from your mistakes and keep at it until you succeed. I hope ISRO can make it in anothet mission. Best of luck next time! Don't cut off the feed for fuck Sake...let people see the harsh reality!

May be success or failure but let us see that! We are still proud of out scientists and everyone working on this project! [deleted] Reasons data can be lost

1. The lander malfunctioned ,went in too hard and crashed thus destroying the transmitter
2. The transmitter malfunctioned but the lander did manage to carry on and survive

&#x200B;

most likely its Number 1 , but even if the lander did manage to survive  it can't really function without data transmission ISRO Chief, K Sivan to ANI: We've found the location of #VikramLander on lunar surface and orbiter has clicked a thermal image of Lander. But there is no communication yet. We are trying to have contact. It will be communicated soon. 

https://twitter.com/timesofindia/status/1170611250054627329 [removed] Windows is now rebooting to apply updates... Neil deGrasse Tyson being an absolute person of positivity. His words are so motivating. I am feeling very bad for him :( [removed] [deleted] Think of what a momentous achievement this is: to have come from a smattering of diverse cultures , pedigrees and kingdoms exploited by colonial masters to maintaining a most diverse and robust union. From being a vessel of the worlds pity to being able to emulate and in some aspects supersede the achievements of Soviets and the Americans with both our arms tied behind our backs. What we as Indians achieved here today is still significant and more than any other nation can lay claim to. The object of science is progress. We successfully launched an efficient and cost effective mission to the moon. It was ambitious and indigenous. That in itself is worth a century of pride. The certainty that we will be able to learn move on and get there next time makes me happy. The nat geo host seems to be good! Putting this mission on Livestream should only go on to show how difficult the work that the ladies and gents over at ISRO do. Immense respect for every single person involved and hope this brings more of the bright folks into the field. GG Listening to Neil Degrasse Tyson at 3 am

I count this as an absolute win Didn't feel this bad even after my math board exam ...And that exam was a fucking tragedy Bhai ₹500 jyaada le le bus land karaa de Some kid actually asked about reservation lol. F That falling short of 2.1 odd kms made me cry! Can truly understand what the ISRO scientists and staff may be going through Non-political, just an ISRO fanboy. Where can I find official ISRO merch? We need to commemorate Chandrayaan 2 forever. Ya it failed. but brighter side is that orbiter is still working absolutely perfectly. The moon is India’s backyard- Neil deGrasse Tyson From twitter @AksharPathak

[Everyone's like ""oh why is Chandrayaan landing so late in the night I won't be up to see it"", what else were you expecting ki day mein land hoga how is that possible din mein moon hota nahi you idiots.](https://twitter.com/AksharPathak/status/1170012859658489856) An expert on DD says the velocity was supposed to be 2m/s when we saw around 40m/s. Doesn't sound good. During the live descent trajectory plot that was displayed on screen it can be seen that the green line represented actual trajectory and the red line represented planned trajectory.

Could someone theorize (or attempt to explain) as to why the green dot representing the lander proceeded (and eventually stopped) until \~0.5 Km but the official announcement mentioned that communications were lost at 2.1km above the surface ?

How exactly was ISRO measuring the vertical altitude of the lander ? Might be little off topic, but i really want watch this on big screen. Portrayal of failures is as important as success. I believe they can be more inspiring considering success is build on layers of failures.
Failures are often stereotyped, i really hope someone comes up with it. Heard one of the scientists say ""kya btaogae ghar pe ?"" (""What will you inform at home ?""). This hurts man. We are proud of our scientists. They have created history. No need to lose heart. Our scientists have done a great job. 

Jai Hind!

- Arvind Kejriwal It's hard to see, after so much anticipation that we couldn't reach the mark. This would be a remarkable takeaway for ISRO and for it's quest in doing something valuable for the country. 

The mission was allocated at a cost of Rs 978 crores (which is around 141 Million dollars). 

The prime minister was there consoling the scientists. Social media has been supportive.  Every citizen has backed them! And we continue to do. The PM mentioned the moment, when the announcement was made about the 'lost in communication', the scientists received a major shock. The Pm consoled them and the emotional Chairman Mr K Sivan which was heart breaking to watch!

*..Mahn that for me shows the amount of dedication our intelligent minds put to explore the world.*

This, as I mentioned will be a major takeaway. ISRO is still trying to access communication, and we hope for the best as always.

Some have said that the whole mission should had undergone in secrecy and others object to it by saying that it takes a lot of courage to show your failures. 

*There were also people who commented on the downfall of the economy stating that India should get it's priorities right.*

We as a nation's intellectual minds proceed relentlessly towards development and major breakthroughs in the STEM field. There will always be ups and downs, like these, and it is the fundamental duty of every citizen to encourage and motivate anyone on the quest for the incredible! 


Mera Bharat Desh Mahaan! JAI HIND!!! 50 rs extra lelo bas land kara do 😒 Looks like it crash landed. There were two other communication systems in place outside of India and all three of them (ISRO+2) lost communication. Most probable cause is hardware malfunction of vikram. I hope I'm wrong though. I hope it just comes back when everyone is about to leave like in hindi movie We go again. Space is hard guys, we go again. Hope those kids don’t lose morale and take it as a challenge and pursue career in astronomy and get us success in future. group hugs y'all I am not certain but I think it was Curiosity or Opportunity Rover where NASA tried and made the rover fit inside a huge ball, think it was? And the ball just absorbed all the entry impact in Mars and then opened up for the rover to explore. Could we have tried something of that sort or am I too Naive? So the landing was guided or non guided? What bewilders me is the fact that people are so dejected with the lost communication as if it is all over. For starters, let me tell you such missions are fully automated so there is a significant possibility that the lander might be sitting duck on the moon. I strongly believe that our scientists would have a contingency plan to relay communication using the orbiter. For that we have to wait till the orbiter is in the right position. Otherwise, if the lander has crash landed on the surface then its debris would be captured by the orbiter. Till then there is hope. Did Vikram die? :( I hope he is alive up there Please don't give front row seat to the Isha Yoga guy or any one who feeds on gullibility, spreads misinformation, showcases utter disregard and disrespect towards science. Not because, I hate those kind of people; but because you're insulting hardworking people of ISRO and other people who have contributed to the mission.

IMO, front row seats should belong only to scientists and journalists who have dedicated their life towards progress of science. Motherfucker mujhse pehli try mein code compile nahi hota and these guys are landing shit on the motherfucking moon. I feel so stupid Did we lose contact or shit? We might  have some bad news, it looks like  lander should have sent confirmation by now. [This was the first moment which made me feel something has gone wrong.](https://i.imgur.com/iESr1nG.jpg) Semi final wali feeling Stop hitting him, he did the best he could, maybe next time better :( Not bad from kaka. Good thing to hear for the scientists. ""I know what it's like to lose. To feel so desperately that you're right, yet to fail nonetheless. It's frightening. Turns the legs to jelly. I ask you, to what end? Dread it. Run from it. Destiny arrives all the same."" :( Orbiter is still fine. Let's hope for the best what exactly happened? is the rover landed but lost communication? or no status known of landing? just want to say, i am proud that we tried it and did it the best possible way. hope isro has better data now to do next landing with more precision. ""jeevan me utar chadhav ate rehte hai. Lekin ye chota achievement nahi hai. Aapne bahut kuch sikhaya hai hame. Himmat ke sath chale. Mai aapke sath hun. Wish you all the best""- PM to ISRO scientists Loud angry question by NDTV reporter Pallava Bagla about why chairman wasn’t here to announce this instead of a “junior” spokesperson. 

Some uncomfortable stares. 

“Data is being analyzed” 

:(

(More awkward than that lander failure) Why is the green line moving away from the red one I hope that is not the case but I think that the spacecraft has crashed. At ~12-13 mins the data stopped updating and the scientists starting getting concerned.

When looking at the numbers, the last update was that the craft had a horizontal descent velocity of ~48m/s at a bit under 400m height, which is nearly 170-200km/h and vertical descent velocity of 59m/s, which is around 240km/h. To put it in perspective, the craft was descending at a speed faster than most if not all trains running in this country. Reading Modi's last tweet, Seems like there is no revival and the Vikram Lander mission has failed...

More power to the scientists though,worked like crazy hard for everything! Last 1.2 km and bam...right in the feels man... Indian Parents will hate Neil uncle for his tips given to the students. I wonder what happened to Vikram after we lost contact, did it drift away from the Moon surface or crash land on it.. [https://twitter.com/fawadchaudhry/status/1170073327324545024?s=20](https://twitter.com/fawadchaudhry/status/1170073327324545024?s=20)

  


He is s&t minister of Pakistan [removed] I have grown up with ISRO. I have seen more failed mission live than successful ones. ISRO really struggled post-1998 sanctions. It was a time when our workhorse PSLV also used to fail but I never saw such negativity back then. Of course, there were not much of social media back then and people were not so invested either. Only Door Darshan TV channel used to broadcast some snippets during launch. Hell, I used to find launch timings buried deep into newspapers. But ISRO always came through. They struggled through cryogenic engines and GSLV too but look how the tamed those naughty beasts. Rocket science is tricky and history teaches us that it can be perfected only by trial & error. Look at DRDO's missile programs, its rather high failure rates is an assurance that we are indeed doing our own R&D and not just C/P imported tech. Today we have a comprehensive missile program which, I can say proudly, is mostly indigenous. And we have ISRO to thank it for. Just this week, IAF placed unfaltering confidence on our own ""Akash Defense System"" over much sophisticated Israeli system, a true joyus occasion. ISRO will come through, have faith.

&#x200B;

The important thing is we must not get demoralized. We have to try again. Next decade is important and we might see a ""moon rush"" again after NASA's Artemis mission. To the infinity and beyond. 🚀 #ISRO [@ChrisG_NSF
If Vikram failed to land - which it looks like - REMEMBER the ORBITER is where 95% of the experiments are. The Orbiter is safely in Lunar orbit and performing its mission. This is not a total failure. Not at all. #Chandrayaan2 #India #MoonLanding #VikramLander](https://twitter.com/ChrisG_NSF/status/1170072433115762688?s=20) Finally some good news for us. I hope ISRO nails the landing. Shit. Modi's leaving. Itna to boards k results k lie tension nhi hui Their body language is saying it all. Feels bad man they have worked so hard. Ight imma head out ""Satisfaction lies in the effort, not in the attainment. Full effort is full victory.""

Mahatma Gandhi A bit unfortunate, but it's still something to take pride in. Not many countries can even attempt something like this. Hopefully we will learn from this and will successfully land the next one. It's official now. Lander communications was lost around 2.1 Kms above surface. Data being analysed. The last data was like .335 km altitude and 45 m/s velocity i believe when they lost signal. Thats a quite high velocity. Everyone can bask in success and offer congratulations , Its in times of adversities like these when we get to see who is truly supporting the Space Mission and who all are just bandwagoning for success. [Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity](https://genius.com/Eminem-lose-yourself-lyrics#note-57553), 

back to the lab again Happiest person right now is Akshay Kumar... He, now, doesn't only have a patriotic script but a patriotic emotional thrilling suspense script. The only bad thing about this is DD's broadcast. That shit is old af. Good guy Modi consolled Sivan before finally leaving. The greatest success with this mission was that how many people will now aspire to study STEM I'm a bit out of the loop here. Will we see live video of the landing streamed ? I didn't even know if that's possible but wasn't the moon landing seen live in 1969. Bruh why the fuck is Gaurav Kapoor hosting this on hotstsar 

This is funniest thing I've seen in a long time Not receiving data it seems What is going on right now? Seems like a chilled silence... Did it crash? Fuck this is nerve wrecking I don't wanna go Mr. Stark.... I think we still did good guys. May be we will do lot better next time. The orbiter will still collect the data. So that's good news. The faces say it all.  It's gone splat. </3

I always liked space explorations, I used to have one small step as a ringtone, this was my chance to witness 1969 :( I am so nervous. I have no idea what happened, but at the same time the faces on the screen tell me that I know what happened. Damn, everyone looking sad as fuck. F for respect and GG for the efforts. That kids from Bhutan looked so scared Oh plz this is the starting of memes #Statement Coming! Watching the opportunity time lapse video on the surface of Mars made me jealous, there could have been similar videos of the moon from C2.  So close, yet so far. 😭 [Everyone at ISRO rn](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EDzvyKLUcAAxqg6?format=jpg&name=900x900) A kid is asking him about reservations and he fucked right out of there. Lol. Complete switch off karke switch on try kiya kya? Sonakshi Sinha knows it. 


/s Need the bollywood twist, come on Vikram! ISRO CHIEF: If he pats me on the back one more time.... Any of you feeling bad for working for corporate and not some organization like ISRO? omg, the commentator is about to go down on modi We're in the end game now Stuck in DRS?  Cmon, the suspense is killing me! i think they've told the PM that its failed A problem has been detected and Windows has been shut down to prevent damage to the computer What data Issa okay. Shit happens. Efforts, people. It would've been wierd if the PM had bolted without giving this pep talk Livestreams ended on all platforms.  
I'd say that's the confirmation I saw the last distance from the surface as 330 m. But the contact was lost at 2.1 km from the surface. So, how was it tracked till 330 m?

What am I missing here? Am not gonna lose Is there going to be a livestream on YouTube? What if instead of water Chandrayan 2 finds oil on Moon, and we see a Press Conference by Trump that they will bring democracy to the Moon. Chalo koi nhi. Boys played well Space is hard man...unknown shit, walking in dark, nobody to give hand, once lost, lost.... rare unscripted speech from modi Just try again. It took hundreds of billions for US to land person on moon. India spent only 150 million yet Modi looks visibly annoyed with the kids. Poor scientists look scared...

Fuck this shit man, The pressure of mission success and on top of that the pressure from Seniors and Politician for their PR...Fuck this! Can we absolutely not get political and shift the attention to the scientists? 

Bruh they were made excited for this shit and y'all busy commenting about how Modi needs to STFU. What else can he do at this moment to be really honest. I hate his politics, but respect to him for the speech and answers Guys, the orbiter is still there and will remain there for another year, meanwhile Pragyaan was supposed to be there for 2 weeks. This mission was not a complete failure like some people are making it to be. Hopefully our students will take this in a positive manner and strive to achieve more in science. Our country needs more scientists, doctors and engineers. Akshay Kumar probably crying as he can't make next film... [removed] It crashed because lander ne paao upar nahi kiye they I'm abuzz. It's almost 9 PM here and we're having a ""Moon landing party"" between roommates. Granted most of them are Irish who just want a reason to drink, but we're buzzed nonetheless.

What's better is that my whole extended family seems to be up, I've already talked to uncles and cousins, even got sharma ji ka beta'd from my mom. This is the time to stand with the scientists, not abandon them!!! /r/yesyesyesno? At least it will stay on the moon forever and was the first object to land on the south. Bhai 200-500 jyada lele...buss land kara do Did modi just took an unscripted question ? Modiji: In bachon ko hi ab se interview dunga Getting super scary. It’s was travelling around 200kmph 😰 If it lost contact at 40ms, did it go splat at 40ms into the ground or was the trajectory preprogrammed It's so fucking crazy seeing all this unfold live! Houston, we've a problem. A huge F for our boy Vikram :( ""Telemetry is lost and no RF received"" were some faint voices near the control panel. Looks like a crash. Fuck why does this seem so scripted. did they get the data back? Did anyone see the lander doing a flip right before landing (during fine braking phase) on those illustrations/visuals? Chalo bhaiyoo Friday night kaafi wild Rahi. Ab sojaate h First mudiji fucks off.
Then they cut the live isro feed.
Dafuq is going on? It looks bad guys .. Aaah man... Anybody has an idea that how much time goes into analysis of the said data? Aliens got to it Mera Vikram aayega people said there would be some announcement. Link? So when we will get first update from orbiter? AS ISRO REACHED FOR THE MOON, ITS SCIENTISTS FACE PAY CUTS

As the nation gets hyped with praise pouring in from all corners, ISRO scientists aren't quit happy with the recent decision of the govt to reduce salaries of about Rs10,000/month.

This is the absolute opposite of the 1996 decision that approved for double hikes in salaries. 

The appeal has been penned by the chairman of SEA (Space Engineers Association).

""The government order talks of the performance-related incentive scheme (PRIS), which it says should not affect the 1996 decision of the double increments for ISRO staffers, because PRIS does not affect the basic income of any government servant.""

Akshay kumar has a nice script for movie Can we stop showering attention on every move Modi makes and actually focus on the scientists ffs. Theres plenty of time to bash him,but this isnt one. Im legitimately feeling sad about this:( Here is the first line of the control module's code:

    /*-----Om Shri Ganeshaaya namah-----*/ Yo this looks fooking interesting - probably some kid who watched this these guys are no nonsense , If they knew 100% it has failed they would have announced it by now

There still might be a sliver of a chance Fingers crossed that we can emerge stronger from this and funding is not cut. If i am not wrong Nat Geo is actually airing a show in which the channel will telecast chanderyaan 2 landing on moon's surface and the show will probably be shown around 11pm, perhaps? [BGM for](https://youtu.be/m3zvVGJrTP8) those terrifying 15 minutes ready. SPACE & UNIVERSE ([YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZiJMW5AdHY)) seems to be the one stream showing live feedback, is it from the orbiter? Even official ISRO is not showing that stream.

Update-1 | 1:07 AM: None of the mission control screens, seems to show what SPACE & UNIVERSE is showing. It seems very suspicious, are they just showing some old pre-recorded lunar video?

Update-2 | 1:19 AM: Yep, what they were showing till now was old video from some lunar mission. They have now switched to mission control video like all other streams. Is that Internet Explorer lol? Matlab!!? Im so excited, fingers crossed. From their looks, feels like scientists needs a good sleep...all with the puffed & tired eyes...

Hope all goes well and they get one! Doesnt look good. Not receiving telemetry from Mauritius no signal coming in from mauritius station ...The longer it goes on the worse the chances of success Doesn't look good guys. massive klpd BC, fuck. We all jinxed it. Pls pls Fuck modi is going down # F [So close...](https://i.imgur.com/IVYsgCI.png) Why it feels like this is a drama and soon they will celebrate... they r fuckimg with everyone... Mil gaya data Wait....Did someone mention SSR is receiving data?. Damn they cut the feed. Looks like a attempt only Bois :( why are the tables squiggly rather than straight? Genuine question +19 minutes since the link was lost. Listening to Man on the Moon in memory of our boi Vikram and lil bro Pragyan.. Heartbreaking. :(  I’m so sad Has this mission failed or there is still some hope?

Modi leaving is giving mixed signals. Unrelated,but why are so many of those kids wearing glasses Looks like failure in the late stage of the lander. We are gonna come back for sure but this is gonna hurt for a while... Word from ISRO, in next 12 minutes...Wait! Joe ""Rahul ShivShankar"" Rogan Bhai 500 lele bas land karade Yeh PUBG wala hain kya! F This is like the climax of a movie scene fuckkk plssss Kaka bhaag gaya? While it's sad, at least it was not a manned mission. The only loss is material. Neil deGrasse Tyson on Times now...never thought I'd say that Good job lads Remember that state of unity costed three times more than Chandra yaan 2 Why has everyone in this thread given up? Vikram is automated and loss of signal doesn't mean that it crashed. Go to sleep guys.. There probably won't be any big updates till the morning

They'll corroborate and confirm the landing malfunction in a few more hours I can already see the Akshay Kumar starring biopic. MISSION SUCCESS: 95% (So far)

Orbiter is the main mission. Lander and rover is like tech demonstration and a milestone that we landed on the surface. 

Hope we wake up in the morning with good news. 


Crash Landing is landing too. 100% ^\^s Ground Control to Major Tom  
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong  
Can you hear me, Major Tom?  
Can you hear me, Major Tom?  
Can you hear me, Major Tom?  
Can you....  
  
  
....Here am I floating 'round my tin can  
Far above the moon  
Planet Earth is blue  
And there's nothing I can do.. One small step for Vikram. One giant leap for 1.3 billion. Let's go. Amit bhai kuch karo.. halat tight h It reached till 400 meters...Seems like it lost the projected path there after and hit ground on uneven level... 

Hope, the rover is still okay and does its work! But first communication with lander is must...

Oh you 4 crore Gods, wake up...Wake up! Modi said bye... Mission failed we'll get em next time Can anyone sum up what's happened? Really lost here. RIP YouTube Stream as soon as Modi left PM to address nation at 8am from ISRO control centre Rahul Shivshankar on Times Now World looks out of his depth lol.
Edit : Misspelt his name. Why do they have hindi and english in the same stream, i dont like to hear the same thing 2 times , are there english only streams anywhere? The descent phase begins ....Almost like watching a thriller. Good luck guys... Will we get to see the real live stream from the satellite? History in the making. I like how everyone is in formals but this one dude comes in a jacket Man that people at ISRO are excited as kids. Their so much hard work is finally paying off. Oh, fuck. what's happening ...fuck me Something is definately off rn. Patience, thoda patience Looks bad guys. The orbiter will still be running so at least there's that Did we lost the communication with the probe? F Bhai panga ho gya ITS RECIEVING DTAA!?!?!? Hang in there, mates. the ""RF to orbiter"" is for the orbiter not Vikram Arrey koi confirm karo. RF! Bhai, Terror wala phase khatam hi nhi ho rha Hopefully the orbiter can carry on with its experiments even if Vikram has issues feed re-started !! Live stream announcement just now said only that the vehicle was observed until a certain altitude then communications were lost. 

They have not specified loss of the landing vehicle, but it is implied.  

This is sad. Peetega kya saley Ya looks like a crash... Modi giving pick up speech. Damn... Man i feel so sad.... When is the next moon mission?

November? is this a first major failure? It is taking so long because IBM is doing the RCA. Was landing automatic or manual? Did the lander take commands from here at each step of the way or the process was completely handled by itself with all the commands on it already? ﻿ Yo introvertedguy whatever...

Can you go 5 secs without making some cringy reference... Nobody wants to see it Well, ISRO does have the balls to livestream it though I'm watching India Today Live and they are doing everything they can to not admit that the lander crashed. They keep saying the landing is ""delayed"" and reiterating praise for Modi for not shitting on the scientists, as if that's a high bar. Rocket science is fucking hard, they shouldn't be ashamed to admit that this is a setback. [deleted] I think the PM left. We all know what that means boys. Modi: Ight imma head out! Experts at Home: ""Solar battery phook gayi"" 😂 [removed] Remember to play this as it lands

People who grew up in the 80's will understand scenes if the computer bluescreens Need more practice playing Kerbal Space Program it seems I need a cigarette Data is being analysed!! Modi is leaving. that's it boys. Can we see our scientists, please?
They matter the most, here! Loads and loads of mud sledging will happen...But just remwber your every word and criticism will be directed towards those hardworking Scientists!

If had it been Success it would be shared among all, but when its failure it will be of scientists. That's just how it is.

So just be careful. :( LOL, just watched the PM dodge a question on reservation. [removed] Neil Tyson ne Times Now ki TRP bada di Idk why but i am feeling so sad right now and i can't control it! Hope i will get to hear good news on the morning. ✌ So is it confirmed dead? Well guess no new movie from Akshay Kumar. Yo idiots ...You'll have plenty of opportunities to shit on Modi and the gov later

Some unity and compassion  right now wouldn't go amiss Most of the scientists looks like my neighborhood kulcha uncles and aunties Whatever the agenda maybe, but kudos to kaka for being there and talking to all the people and asking them to be courageous. Fuck, it looks like it crashed Wait Modi leaving? Why?? This is just like Dhoni waiting till the end saying not yet, to hit those 14 runs in last over...

Fingers crossed! All is well... If Vikram has crashed, how will we know it? at least we tried Seems like a crash boys.
Martians got the landing craft. The raeson for feed cut might also be partially that some passionate folks might have started crying.

Modi alos said ""Be courageous"". Lander landed on the moon, and the communication between lander and orbiter is back...We will need to check the whereabouts of lander from orbiter. 

Lastly, the rover can still be activated and made to do his walk...Let's hope for best! Wrong question at very wrong time girl. Good man Modi...First time since he became PM I am happy by his words for those Scientists...His words will lift their morals! Be courageous. Economy ka kuch dekho ""Be courageous"". Man this is one time when I didn't want to hear any pep talk :( Why did they cut feed?
Gimme my right to information Pondicherry ko wadakkam! [Neil deGrasse Tyson is live on Times now](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/live-tv) >This is Mission Control Centre. #VikramLander descent was as planned and normal performance was observed up to an altitude of 2.1 km. Subsequently, communication from Lander to the ground stations was lost. Data is being analyzed.
#[ISRO](https://twitter.com/isro/status/1170086810006900736?s=09) Regardless of the mission's outcome, can someone shed some light as to why we were focusing on moon instead of mars where there's a possibility of sustaining life? I get that no one has explored the dark side of the moon or whatever it is called but is it more important than Mars? We do have plans for Mars but I suppose if we focused more on that instead of moon then that mission will have a greater chance at success. About time people.. Why is this thread dead It's happening!! Ruh oh Something screwed up or what Signal's not being received God damn !! Has it landed ? Telemetry lost ??? 
Mission control center looking grim No celebrations so far is bad Only Madrid station is replying to the signal. It finished fine braking correct? Is everything alright? It seems something is not alright . God!!! Plssss. Damn my heart is racing, hoping for the best.... Worried. The mood is looking terrible, across the room Looks like its crashed. 😭 Yo Data pack recharged!! They have communication with the orbiter Did she just say, ... confirmed ?? Receiving data...was that a question or statement? They cut the feed!! Oh god! The uncertainity is getting unbearable :( why is the feed showing a still image? I'm so confused, what is going on? If it was a hard land or crash, what's the odds of Pragyan being OK? Data being analysed Hmm.. Stating the obvious. But what can he do. Can the orbiter or a satellite capture image of the landing site? Who is the astronaut on the hotstar stream? Hotstar stream is  slow compared to YouTube What happens to that spacecraft debris there? Cool This is why you don't need to turn this into a fucking promotional program, space is hard. First thing that crept into my mind was wow they must be so confident they are literally live telecasting the event. Still waiting and hoping that it's just some communication error >	Till date, only three countries - Russia, the US and China-have successfully soft-landed on Moon. Windows update ? Well, F's in the chat for all of us who are going to be late tomorrow to school, college, office , sigh Also F for Vikram RIP RIP RIP [deleted] They should hire an astrologer to use his divya drishti to see what happened [deleted] The livestreams ended when PM left. That's sad. Makes one think if it was all about his visit. 

A debriefing from a scientist before ending the stream could have helped. Why is Modi shown so prominently in a lunar landing event? How are the kids not posting stories smh, is this digital India? Now this is cringe. Please Stop. Guys can you updoot this thread to 200 What’s with grown men giving red roses to modiji? Scientist Aunty is announcing something .. lets hope for the best ,  but it doesn’t look good at all! oof ISRO stream cut It is still a proud moment for us guys. We will come back stronger.  :’) The best thing Modi can say is that we are going to try again. Chandrayaan 2 landed, just not the way it was supposed to [deleted] They're clapping a lot. That's good right? it crashed right? Shit! Come on. We need a win here after all that's happening looks like they exhausted their claps early. Who is going to give Modi the bad news? #F The police walked by the cameraman,and the camera cut off to another one. Hmmmmm /s must be a bad feeling  for the kids ... Kaka is back. [Mission failed we'll get em next time](https://youtu.be/Le9sLw2VdUg) I feel like he says the same things everywhere Has it crashed? Or no signal? Modi kaha gya? F ? Not to worry, Modi ji is now on the floor. [deleted] Maybe it landed and was attacked by the Israeli tardigrades? Watching it live on hotstar. It all seems so scripted. I do hope it is and they announce that the mission is a success like it happens in movie after almost failing in something. Modi is not ready for questions lol This hitting is getting annoying, Mr. Modi. Alright, Clap Clap Clap! Almost there! Vertical descent shortly Why is everyone tensed? What's happening?! Suspence guys...Suspence! 

Do no worry! All will be well... Boys played well, better luck next time. It would be great to be provided an update on if/when the orbiter can 'scan' the landing site and provide an assessment - assuming the onboard systems of the lander are knocked offline by the landing maneuvers... Looks like the orbiter is receiving data? Or was that a question? feed cut? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvloHsmi_vg This duffer Modi spoils my mood. He wants to use everything for PR.

This should be only and only about ISRO scientists. Modi came to take credit... Leaves when landing fails.
But honestly respect to Modi for handling the response well, I think that pep talk was much needed for the scientists at ISRO.
May we reach greater heights! Now I am really worried about the manned space mission.  I'm blaming the inauspicious presence of Modi. Chanda mama so gaye suraj chachu jage....seems very relevent now!!! [deleted] ISRO chairman briefing kaka. Kaka must be saying *Amit ko call lagaun kya? kuch jugaad kar dega.* Nehru you son of a bitch you've done it again! Neil Armstrong was so damn lucky man! Agla wala Mars me bhejo, it should walk more than Opportunity rover. It likely failed, they just want to wait for the signal to confirm it. Social media is like its not a module . Kisika bachcha kho gaya ho lmao.

Maybe people should give two shits about issues that they actually can influence. Is Wikipedia down for you guys too? 

Likely not the cause, but it _may_ be us Indians looking up shit

Edit: it's up When modi came... felt like he was bit off.... thinking about something else..... there is shit about somrthing which makes him stressed oit.. Fuck i am getting panic attacks now . God plss .. let something move . I think it crashed, but, I am still very proud of ISRO. They have done amazing work in this mission too. NDTV ka kehna h ki bht tez takraya isliye Singal toot gya!. [deleted] Yes modi lol Yo Sathvik this is awesome. Glad that other countries explore space other than US, Russia and China 2.1 km, the distance between success and failure. Feel sad for the scientists who have worked hard for so many years. Also, Modi is such a bad omen. [deleted] Nehru is responsible for this. I guess all the praying and astrology really does not work

https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/india-news-opinion-was-isro-chief-right-in-offering-prayers-ahead-of-chandrayaan-2-launch/334944 WTF. Why does it look like a PR exercise with the PM now. We want to know the status in the control room. C’monn modi wtf that’s his speech !! Wtf
A person so well at giving speeches. Really those two words ???? Modi is so ready to fire off a tweet like :  The cost if this mission is less than the budget of Avengers Endgame [deleted] [deleted] Oh god here goes gobhi with his pseudo philosophical ramblings again Reminder that 'wAStAge oF PuBliC reSourCes in a CounTRy of pOverTy' is the same type of rhetoric used by sanghis to discredit PhD scholars like Kanhaiya, Shehla Rashid etc. Where did Modi go? Now... where it all begins? **Fake News** Ngl she's kinda cute doe

What's her @ I was up all night😩 nvm
Props to ISRO for attempting It got done oof'd There is no official announcement yet but agar it fails then Modi credits kaise lega saare. Now is the the time we put some money into some real research and development, we have to learn from these mistakes and improve ourselves. It’s a bit irritating to hear the mission was 95% success. For almost 30 years ISRO has been putting payloads into orbits, of  various kinds. 

This time what was different and unique was the payload had to descend and be soft-landed with baby hands.  And then the rover part , which was huge ( If the descent worked) . Both the new and unique parts of the mission didn’t succeed. So you could argue that the mission was a 20% success. 

I prefer to say that this shouldn’t be looked at a binary way. They’ve got to be learning from this experience.

What failed? - thrusters  or some other subsystem ?

Or what failed - the mission itself was strategically wrong - you were trying to land in an area where it was impossible to nail a proper landing ... or you wanted to be ‘1st rank/Guinness ‘ - that peculiar Indian need to be first in something ( first people to land in the hardest spot on the lunar surface)  And whatever happened to “walk before you run” - why not try an easy landing on an easy area. ( hindsight tells us even that’s not easy) I hope bhakts doesn't blame it on Nehru.

Edit : LMAO. Bhakts triggered ""Pragyan will not stray too far from the Vikram lander, given that its maximum range only extends over 500 metres.""

Bit of an anti climax or klpd this.. I have a strong feeling that they'd lie to us now \[**Unpopular opinion**\]

I'm very disappointed by the way ISRO, govt. is handling this failure, they should have come forward with actual data. Every amateur astronomer and enthusiast found that the lander was moving at a velocity in which it is not possible to descent safely, just by looking at the parameters on the mission screens, so why lie to your tax-payers which made this mission possible? 

A-least they didn't do a Balakot and lie to the world that the lander had landed and rover functioned as planned.

Failure was expected, it was a hard mission, kudos to the every person involved, but I have lost faith that any public organization in the country would provide factual data as long as this govt. is in power. Perhaps, future govt. will follow the suit as well, considering how well this strategy works to sway the public opinion. [deleted] [removed] PM Modi obviously hasn't left.

He's just praying to god jee 🙏🏻❤️😍

Whatta wonderful man [deleted] Modi and his speeches, sigh What if it crashes like the Indian economy? /s

Edit: Had to add the /s. Even I don’t want it to crash smh [deleted] Well the real question is whether the lander was tested in all scenarios with the right sort of stress tests, of course the intent here isn't to question the abilities of scientists but to understand why and hopefully futuristic missions learn from it . also there was an initial snag and then they deferred and then they again changed it in a short while. As general public we are obviously proud of frugality of isro but accountability can't be overlooked. It just blows my mind the Soviets did it in 1966. More than 50 years before. We are so far behind. Ab toh Modi phas gaya. Sab kuch live stream pe hai, koi surgical strike type exaggerate karke bol bhi nahi sakta. Is this lady telling or asking data received? So confusing. 10 minutes of lost communication and the entire bjp machinery went into panic mode.  
  
Kashmir has been without communication for a month now. [removed] Looking at the bright side, atleast Modi the braggart didnt get to take the credit for this big a mission..if this was successful, you're certain he'd have built his entire election agenda on roaming around the world boasting about his credentials taking credit for this..ironic for someone as anti-science as him Didn't Dr. Sivan perform puja for the success of the mission? What happened? Why did Modi give that speech ? Have we succeeded ??? Please somebody inform. The news is nonsense It performed oof Not a rocket scientist here but, shouldn't ISRO gone for something like parachute landing with protective bouncing covering like NASA did with Mars rover? Wonder what the logic was to land it with powered engines. I believe 2-3km is a doable height for parachute landings. My 2 cents.. [removed] [deleted] Probably lander ran out of battery, maybe just need to be recharge by solar light [deleted] [removed] FFS! I don't want modiji's lecture now 😡 Did they try turning it off then on again?  F F Technology in India is not there yet 932 crores  of tax payers money wasted . Thanks Isro Welp, a huge failure. [deleted] Well, now we can focus on issues in the country hopefully we're running out of ground water. [deleted] What a failure [deleted] Why the hell is it taking such a long time to land this damn thing? 

I mean it was launched some 40 days ago, wasn't it? PM in ""boys played well inshallah"" mode [removed]"

458,Science/Technology,A place to discuss scientific and engineering research for and by Indians? [Science & Technology],https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5jscfe/a_place_to_discuss_scientific_and_engineering/,"I've been thinking about this for a while. It would be illuminating to have regular discussions on advanced scientific and engineering research, in the context of India, and amongst the reddit-faring desi junta and interested non-Indians.
 
The topics of discussions could be anything from in-depth technical discussions and debates on a particular research topic, a paper, a government or corporate project to scientific policy, funding & related issues, tips for new researchers etc, if it is spearheaded by Indians (at home or abroad) or is being conducted in India as a part of a global collaboration (e.g., INO).

I am in two minds about what would be a good place for this. One on hand, having a separate subreddit sounds like a good idea to consolidate and stay focused. However, in my experience most Indian subreddits other than randia don't really get much traction and end up dying. I think the goal of such discussions should not only be exchange of ideas and information amongst researchers, but also with a larger audience. Given that /r/India is the largest, most cohesive (heh) agglomeration of desis on reddit, perhaps a discussion thread once/twice a month would be better. Of course, the format and the discussion topics would be more restrained in those threads and won't really be a free-for-all.

I would like to hear suggestions from randian researchers and non-sci/tech folk alike on this. ", make linkedin or google groups? you always want to link all these with Twitter/fb pages to harmonize and point to the real source Let everything happen in r/india

Does Arnab Goswami and his chums have the balls to question this? If this is not compromise, then I don't know what is. What is the point of majority if you still reward corrupt assholes.

This is why BJP supporters, the moderate centrists (swing vote), need to start being more vocal critics of poor govt. decisions. Some very questionable souls have crept into the Cabinet and people are so consumed by the Modi hype, that they don't bother to question. I am more sad than happy with this. Harshwardhan gone to other ministry, good, but which ministry : Science..now I am in doubt if he will start working on ""Indian Science"". And who has replaced him ?

>* NEW DELHI: Concerned over China outpacing India in the science and technology sector, Niti Aayog has recommended constituting a national Science, Technology and Innovation foundation headed by a distinguished scientist to coordinate efforts on national scale and come out with a roadmap.

>* In terms of patents granted abroad, India improved its global rank from 27th to 15th over the same years and China from 25th to 8th.

>* The foundation will coordinate with science and technology, departments, concerned line ministries, State governments, academics and researchers, private sector leaders in the field and other stakeholders to identify and deliberate national issues, recommend priority interventions in S&T and prepare frameworks for their implementation.

>* The draft action plan also said that Indian innovations should address the needs of burgeoning middle class and rural residents.

>* We must facilitate the development of affordable and durable products that are suitable for the local demand and context, it added.

462,Science/Technology,India needs to invest more in education and health care or else the future of India is doomed.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e6ekhy/india_needs_to_invest_more_in_education_and/,"Why doesn't the govt invest more in education? 

Education funding is only 3% of GDP, while many developed nations spend about 6% of GDP. Many experts say education funding should be ideally 6% of GDP.

Look at the age demographics of this country. According to 2011 census data about 608 million (60.8 crore) are below the age of 25, about half the population of the country and about 372 million(37.2 crore) are below the age of 15, so about 30% of the population is below the age of 15, as India's was 1.21 billion (121 crore). Today, we would have even a larger total no. of people below the age of 25 and 15.

It is also said the India's demographic dividend will peak at 2041, where no. of people in the working age (20-59 years old) will peak. 

However if the govt doesn't invest in education and reforms the education system, since our education system is just rote learning and doesn't teach us to think critically, and it doesn't impart people with skills. The literacy rate of india according to 2011 census is only 74% and that vast majority even those who are literate do not receive quality education, it is said that 80% of engineering and MBA grads are unemployable , How will india progress?

Investing in education(and healthcare) is one of the best ways to raise the human capital(skills and expertise of the population).

Currently, india ranks 115 in human capital index. Having high human capital is crucial to economic development, increasing productivity, making progress in science and technology and innovation.

According to a report from world bank,[source](http://web.worldbank.org/archive/website00811/WEB/OTHER/9C8ACC61.HTM?OpenDocument). More than half the children in india are malnourished, 30% of newborns are underweight and 60% of women are anemic. Malnutrition costs india atleast about $10 billion or about Rs. 700 billion(Rs 70,000 crore) in terms of lost productivity , illness and deaths, which is about 23 times the cost of statue of unity.

If india doesn't invest more in education and health care, reforming education and health care system, improving the quality and infrastructure of govt schools and hospitals too, then we will hundreds of millions of unskilled and unproductive people in the future, which would be a disaster to development and progress."," The priorities of the people and (so) of the government are wrong. The government wants to invest in Bullet train. Their priorities are Ram Mandir, Ram Setu, Ram Lalla, Cow Mata, Yoga, Havan, Yagna, etc. It is a clueless government elected by clueless people. They won't invest in education and healthcare. In fact the people of India will not elect a party that sets healthcare and education its priority. They will elect a party that promises to bomb Pakistan or throw the Muslims in the sea. You should not have great expectations from 1.3 billion simpletons. I will keep it simple, when people don't have jobs and education, they are easy to manipulate. That is not going to change because its profitable Basically, we need Kejriwal as the PM If the govt. Invests more in healthcare and education, it is leftist, communist, marxist and what not. If we go by the ammount of young population here, good education will change the country (in a goodway ofc) in no time. If you invest in education, where will you find new bhakts? The education  budget used to me more. 

The govt. Has been gradually reducing it since 2014.  

Priorities. We invested 1% of our GDP last year on health care

&#x200B;

Let this sink in. >Education funding is only 3% of GDP, while many developed nations spend about 6% of GDP. Many experts say education funding should be ideally 6% of GDP.

The priorities of a supply side regime has always ever been in cutting social expenditure on the side of people.

Why so? Now you can look at classical economics, and try to find what the supply side economics really stand for.

An auction market, where people have ""fair idea of wages and price levels and rights""

Now, you have to question where from can the source of such exploitation be? 

In any case the classical position is that demand will balance itself out (which is a pretty bad argument, I will say), and the effect of government spending is crowding out of investment (which is again a problematic position). So, it has to be G = T, if the equilibrium has to be maintained. And in classical supply side economics, the only way to spurs growth, is to shift the Ns and Nd meeting point far eastwards, with maximum N and minimal real wage, given Y = F (K,N). In order to do that, you need to provide tax cuts, to the richest. Government intervention is doom for them and their market system runs of ""no rights for the employees"" because it is a supply side constraint.

Now you will ask me why am I saying all this, because its really not relevant.

The source of exploitation in the auction market situation is highly imperfect knowledge on the part of the employees (am not saying this, Alfred marshall said this). Now, even the best of capitalists knew that the access of the average worker to the ""education, knowledge, and henceforth rights"" would remain constrained and he would basically be entrapped as ""a labour"", albeit skilled one, with low negotiation power in the face of industry.

The idea of vile maxim and goodwill of the entrepreneur thus was put in the graveyard along with adam smith. Only invisible hand remained.

Public access to education being low, always enables a supply side oligopolist/monopolist to enjoy huge control on the labour. Education, as in education and not just being skilled labor is antithetical to capitalist interests. Little wonder victorian era education wanted man to be an educated slave. Not a leader. Little wonder leadership crisis is real, across nations and across industries.

>Look at the age demographics of this country. According to 2011 census data about 608 million (60.8 crore) are below the age of 25, about half the population of the country and about 372 million(37.2 crore) are below the age of 15, so about 30% of the population is below the age of 15, as India's was 1.21 billion (121 crore). Today, we would have even a larger total no. of people below the age of 25 and 15.

>It is also said the India's demographic dividend will peak at 2041, where no. of people in the working age (20-59 years old) will peak.

Beyond it, its also very gendered. Like take the PLFS and NSSO surveys, the degree of fall in WPR of women, was almost 18% from 2005 to 2018. (Above 15 y of age). Now the average ""bhagwa"" apologist reply is that, see, people must be earning better so girls are in homes. Thus, I decided to look deeper into indices, and an article too confirmed that unemployment, in the poorest expenditure decile fell from 30.8 to 16.5%. 

I took rural women and the lowest expenditure decile to clearly show, that how the lack of education directly affects employability. In this case, lets find out how a govt intervention holds a decent case 

For one, the avg woman selling sabzi in the mandis would rather want to save the extra penny rather than send her daughter to the ""private"" school. She simply cannot afford. And the tragedy of the govt schools is that most lack any decent investment and govt spending. The solution is not privatisation. The solution isn't tax cuts. But to increase govt expenditure per GDP to schools.


>However if the govt doesn't invest in education and reforms the education system, since our education system is just rote learning and doesn't teach us to think critically, and it doesn't impart people with skills. The literacy rate of india according to 2011 census is only 74% and that vast majority even those who are literate do not receive quality education, it is said that 80% of engineering and MBA grads are unemployable

See, firstly let me tell you this unemployable thing is a horrible joke. India has seen a jobless growth for years. Since 1991. The interest of the firms is profit maximization. So they would retrench people for suitable technology and ask for no minimum wages. You have to understand whether there is a definite need of

A. Corporate accountability fixation? Wherein you should be answerable for the tax cuts you bag in the name of skilling and run some namesake skipping programs, mired with fraud?

B. Corporate entity as a social entity. A corporation must yield to the social contract on the basis of which it exists in the society, or it should have no existence.

C. Prevention of corporate centralization. Or rather monopoly or oligopoly. In which case they fix the norms. 

D. Corporatization of education. Here you have to ask a lot of things, beyond the top 3

One, the affordability of the higher education system. In case one takes away grants, we will literally see the IITs being super expensive wherein the average bloke won't be able to afford it. 

Two, keeping the education sector as free space,as spaces where criticism is allowed. Nowadays, the idea is that you can freely bash the non majoritarian idea (political, economic anything) but whatever comes in direct contradiction to the interests of the cronies is censored out. It might be your book on baba ramdev, or some documentary by chomsky or anything.

Three, killing the art of questioning. This is definitely missing in our syllabus in india, as the most important virtue that's expected of you, is to obey. Now, corporate centralization will be a massive danger, as AV classes with animations become the norm and teachers become obsolete. The students will be required to learn what comes with the package that some company is making. That might be dangerous. Because that doesn't tell the full story. 

Fourth and most definitely this, is the rampage for marks. That's also very equal to what we do in economics, regurgitate growth, as if it is the panacea. No it isn't. The time has come to move on towards better testing procedures that test your ability to analyse what you have studied. Open book tests. Adaptive tests. 

Fifth, and lastly, the threat to critical analysis from corporatocracy. That's exactly what you see when you see when people say 30 year phd in JNU and news channels run it. Par Mandir kahan banayeinge? But first political parties have to save Hindus from Muslims and vice-versa! Eat

465,Science/Technology,Is the Dream of Kalam dead?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ei5wg9/is_the_dream_of_kalam_dead/,"2020 is finally on the doorstep. For most Indians who grew up in the last two decades, this was a year we were awaiting for, with hopes. Well, it was even more popular than scary-end-of-the-world predictions of 2012 among others! Well, for once hope won over fear!

Now that 2020 is on us, are we the India 2020 that was popularised by Dr. Abdul Kalam? 

That dream is officially 24 years old. Kalam and his team at TIFAC prepared a vision document for the country in 1996, a decade after TIFAC itself was born, incubated under the Dept. of Science & Technology. Kalam took as much pride in the document as in his successes with ISRO and DRDO.
TIFAC laid down a roadmap for sixteen sectors the country should focus on, with numerous sub-areas of technology assessed as the means to acheive it. TIFAC certainly inspired many govt. funded programmes and missions, including TIFAC-CORE which gave a major push for research infrastructure and Industry-academia interaction.

But will 2020 be the year that Kalam and others dreamt of? Most probably not, we are most likely just halfway in that journey. But on the optimistic side, haven't we grown in all terms in the last 24 years?

But it doesn't stop here, and we needn't dwell in regret. In 2015, TIFAC came up with a renewed mission Technology Vision 2035, a sort of version 2.0, in tune with the changes within India and around the world- a fresh technological roadmap for the country's progress. It's a document prepared with so much love, and all lovers of sci-tech should look into it. As the document says: 
""... while TV 2020 spoke to an aspiration of a developed India in 2020, TV 2035 speaks to the realisation of a developed India in 2035""

https://tifac.org.in/index.php/activities/technology-vision-2035

So lovers of science and the country, let's keep dreaming- this time more vividly and work more vigorously to give our tiny bit to it! :)

Happy new year ! let the dreams keep going!"," Next vision after 2035 will be for 2043 But if we concentrate on technology, innovation, progress and economy, then who will drag us backward with religion and hatred? Shangi already gave us another vision trillion dollar economy. India eej da besht beta! Am I the only one who completely forgot that India was to be superpower in 2020 and just got reminded today cos of the memes?"

468,Science/Technology,"25M, Need some Career Advice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f4af6s/25m_need_some_career_advice/," I am a 25 year old guy, currently working at a Web based software company for about 2 years now. The work here is repetitive, with an outdated technology stack and that's why I have been planning to leave it. But I am confused whether to switch the job or do post graduation?

Some background - I graduated from a private college with a BTech degree with average marks. I had some interest in coding since school days that's why I opted for Computer Science. But in the past few months I have come to realize the work I am doing right now is menial and I don't have the skills required to get a job in a good tech company. I have been trying to study to improve them. But without any set target or deadline, I have just wasted the time procrastinating. Also a couple of failed job interviews has made me to think to stop planning about switching and do something else. Like post graduation. GATE and CAT are the only options I have been thinking about because I don't want to study abroad. I have been more inclined towards CAT because syllabus of GATE is vast and since I feel I am good in Logical and Verbal problem solving, given a 8-9 month preparation period I might crack the CAT exam with good percentile. But then I am not sure whether I should leave the tech side for good and switch to management instead.

Please give me some advise about what I should do now. Also please share if anything else comes to your mind that can work for me."," IIITH applications for PGEEE are currently open if you are looking for an Mtech. Exam will be on 26th April. Hey!  You are exactly at the point where I was ten years back. Don't go after the CAT or MBA because it sounds fancy or easy.  You might end up being where you don't want to be.  If you are certain to an extent about what your interests are, it was always better to put more efforts and pursue it, rather than starting something from scratch.  DM me if you feel like you need to talk to someone regarding this. If you have basic CS skills, why not try upskilling into a high demand area like Data science. You can complete an online course while at thr current job and then search for a new job."

I recently got placed in two MNC's first is 'hexaware technologies' and second is 'infosys'.
I have gap in my education does it matter when they perform background verification and terminate me afterwards?
 
My story is :- passed ssc in 2012 and 11th in 2013 , HSC in 2014 
But i got only 60% marks so i wasn't getting any engineering colleges so i decided to go for direct second year diploma for year 2015 and i failed in it. So i had to make exit from diploma and tried for HSC improvement for year 2016 . Got 62 and choose ""Computer science"" Btech . I'm expecting to get graduated by 2020. Now i have 2 jobs in my hand . Both are MNCs. There was no gap criteria mentioned for hexaware but i am not sure about infosys. But if it had been i wouldn't have had been selected. ( I mentioned 1 year of gap while giving first round of infosys, i got that round cleared too ) 

 Backround check usually happens with third party companies.   And as my portfolio looks life this
2012 SSC
2016 HSC 
2020 Btech 
We can see there is timeframe of 4 years between my 10th and 12th, but that is not even gap as first i gave HSC in 2014 , for 2015 i was pursuing diploma ( which i left )  and 2016 again got through HSC .

Does that show any discrepancy in my educational journey? 
Or background verification team just checks for your graduation marks ? Or will they ask me for more information before terminating me? If that happens :(
Please tell me 
Thanks in advance"," Just be honest and give the exact dates and what you were doing in those dates — a timeline, in other words. Given that you have graduated I can’t see them getting too worked up about your schooling.

If they ask mention that you re-sat your HSC to be able to get into engineering and were pursuing a diploma in the interim. But this should be clear from the timeline itself. As long as you declare the gaps properly as per your records you have nothing to worry."

474,Science/Technology,IITs and IISc elearning Courses in Engineering and Science. The technology is a little dated but the content is generally good.,http://nptel.iitm.ac.in/,," Oh yes, I've used these quite a few times. Some of them are excellent and there was a time when I had to learn some subjects by myself for my research and it either wasn't offered in my university or I had to pay out a ton of cash for that course. NPTEL turned out to be very useful then. They have a lot a advanced as well as fundamental courses on so many engineering topics, it's great even if you're just looking to refresh your concepts. 

That said, I have to mention that not all the professors are good teachers. Some of them put you to sleep instantly with their boring voice and others are not very fluent in English and at times I felt like pulling my hair out. I know that's true for all teachers in general but I think there should be some quality control when you're uploading stuff onto the web for everyone all over the world to see. I tried some courses from coursera the other day and the presentation and stuff in general was a whole lot better, even though there isn't a lack of people with a boring voice. But all in all, NPTEL gets an A+. Sound quality has a lot of room for improvement. I became half deaf once I was watching a video on Linked Lists and it's sound would only come out of 1 side of the headphone. I was at IIT B, and I must confess that I passed most of my exams studying from NPTEL. Most the professors at IIT, wouldn't give you notes or presentations they use in lectures  etc. So either you take stuff down from projector at the speed of the light or use NPTEL.

I passed 12th in 2018, and gave jee for the 1st time. Faired miserably and repeated a year and again gave it in 2019. Again didn't study properly and faired badly. Got into an okay okay private college called Heritage Institute of Technology in Kolkata. I'm studying ECE(Electronics and communication engineering) out there.

I've always wanted to study Computer science. With that in mind, I started trying to study discrete math from online resources. However, after finding the road too steep, I gave up. I thought, it'll be better to get a CS degree.

With that in mind, I decided to write Jee again.

In a private college, cracking GATE is my best option to go to a better place, but I doubt if I'll be capable enough to crack it and get into a better college. So I thought, better to write Jee again and try and get some private college with better placement opportunity so that I won't always be in uncertainty over my future.

But now, I don't know if this is the best decision. I don't know what to do. Whether to give up with Jee or continue. I sometimes feel embarrassed to give the exam again. I hate myself, my choices. I don't really know what I want from life. It's like I'm just doing things, not going anywhere - life has no direction. 
It's a rant, I've no one to discuss this situation with."," Please dont lose heart. Research good colleges in US where you can do Masters in CS like government colleges which will give you funding. Concentrate on your studies and get good grades. r/Indian_academia

\> The IISc team observed that at a critical temperature of 160 K (-113.15 degree C) and critical current of little less than 10 milliampere the voltage suddenly shoots up and the gold-silver nanostructures no longer exhibit superconductivity as resistance increases rapidly. A superconductor is one which conducts electricity with zero resistance to the flow of electrons. 

and 

\> Clarifying about the zero voltage Prof. Ghosh said, “At temperatures slightly below 161.3 K the voltage is zero up to 10 milliampere current. The voltage may increase at higher current, which was not tested. Similar behaviour was observed in metal whiskers where superconductivity is observed at a lower temperature. If this is true, why the hell are we publicizing the research??

This has incredible applications, and the strategic advantages must not be squandered. Does anyone else notice how RIDICULOUS The Hindu's website is ?

480,Politics,Pitting a community against a political party is fucking stupid.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/futac9/pitting_a_community_against_a_political_party_is/,"First of all let me start by saying it was stupid whatever some muslims did at nizamuddin and still are doing by staying hidden and not letting the authorities do their work efficiently. 

But this rant is not just about this situation, it is about people's ignorance and lack of knowledge, people don't understand what is propoganda, and they don't know there history either and they continue to pit up a communuty against a political party. No BJP does not represent Hindus all it represents are the hindu extremists, so when i say fuck bjp, it means, fuck the politicians who are making this country burn. Bjp is the only party who has reached new heights and depths of instigating people to turn on each other, and paint muslims as someone who are gonna attack hindus for no reason. Regardless of what people want, a political party's job is to maintain communal harmony in a democratic country. What part of this people don't undertstand ? and why are dalits even supporting BJP's assholes, they beat up dalits, discriminate against them, all bjp is trying to do is keep brahmin supremacy in this country. Everyone is crazy about religion, i say fuck religion, if you believe in a higher power that is cool i don't care but killing in the name of god, fuck no.

Had to get this off my chest, sorry, and thanks for reading if you made it to the end.

If you have any objections to what i have said, i can conversate or debate sanely but please stop the craziness, use your brains i don't care what your parents, uncle aunties believe in, use your own brains otherwise India is not gonna stay a democratic country, and this is not even a baseless fact anymore, it's all around us, we just close our eyes to look around."," Our country is just too far in at the moment and there's no turning back now, our best hope is to believe that we make it to the other side without taking too much damage.

Something much worse than the 2002 riots is ahead of us, it always was but now with the Covid-19 situation acting as a catalyst we are going to reach there sooner. A couple of points

1. I think India is inherently fragile. BJP has not invented something, they are just leveraging the pre existing fault lines. Another thing is that there are so many people who vote for BJP because they are so fed up with the opposition. 

I don’t know exactly but Rahul Gandhi wouldn’t get a lot of crowd in my tiny village. 

2. A substantial part of this country do not care about democracy. People don’t like having to make difficult decisions.

Don’t consider this as a debate to your points, just my PoV. BJP stands for divisive politics. In a state where the minority is a majority they play the outsider insider politics. A place where the majority is the majority the play the caste wala card. BJP is being run like an efficient political business so i don't see when and how it can be stopped. If you kill in the name of religion, your God has already forsaken you.           
- Unknown Though I appreciate what you are saying, Majority of the people are just too naive and uneducated to understand what you are saying.
Lack of Education and awareness is the root cause of divisive politics based off of religion. Your actions show your real motives, not your words. going by your logic, there is no real reason Muslim women should vote for congress as they were the ones opposing triple talaq and it was bjp who made it into law In the US, you say ""Chinese Virus"" and people will call your a racist. 

In India, you say ""Corona Jihad"" you're a nationalist. 

And people say India will soon become a superpower. My ass. If you pay attention, India is becoming the next Pakistan. The only Job of a political party is to stay in power no matter what they have to do for it.
I don't think BJP is at fault, the people of India are at fault. Fuck BJP. Fuck Religious people. Dalits dream of becoming a mainstream Hindu someday where they are treated equally, so they will do what they are told. They forget that they will never be accepted as equal. They are in for a rude awakening >  and why are dalits even supporting BJP's assholes

Because they don't understand how Hinduism promotes Brahminical supremacism, which implies oppression of people like them. That's why they are, and their ancestors before them were, and their descendants will be, dalits!

You can't expect everyone to be as woke as Ambedkar who understood how Hinduism is oppressive to Hindu lower castes. The same people conveniently ignore the numerous Hindu Festivals The reason dalits support bjp is because the rss recruit them at a very young age. Rss targets the vulnerable as in the poor. The poor mostly consists of sc/st. And as such the rss sink their claws into them at a very young age. They're brainwashed by the age they can make decisions on their own they are set in their own ways. This isn't the case for all sc/st some do luckily get away.

They're the same ones that beat the shit out of doctors when something happens because of a lack of supplies. While also using them as scapegoats for thali bhajao bla bla. It's the same with the army. Use them whenever you want to further some sympathy argument but treat them like shit. Wait, so was the complaint legitimate or not? The article isn't clear on this. According to other tweets, the first doctor apparently posted some sort of retraction as well to her claim. Was this under coercion or a misunderstanding from her?

Alt News should probably do an investigation on this topic, as their fact-checking seems to be more rigorous. everyone is silenced.... only JenocideJumlaman speaks. Chutiyon ki kami nahi We respect doctors by endangering their lives.Government should provide ample PPEs to doctors and people should understand that these people are not just endangering their own lives by fighting this epidemic, but their loved ones too and still they are choosing to fight.

Imagine if we send our soldiers in a war without armor or weapons, will we win the war or lose it.This is the same situation that we are in right now.Doctors neither have the weapon or the armor to wage this war for long and this is going to be a long drawn fight.
Also, doctors would be jailed and their license revoked if they refuse to work under these unsafe conditions. We do not need to piss off our medical health services personnel - that should be the rule in best of times, but more so in current circumstances. We are cheap knockoff of China now I would say so what , Doctors go thorugh quite a ragging still . Have the thick skin , thse chutiya social media trolls won't save your life infact it's the other way round. 

Ideally all students/Docs across state should request the CM to procure it . This is the time Or maybe they were spreading fake news and on being called out, they deleted their accounts.

The crowd gathered is humongous and he's not even a mla. That's how you win an election. First of all no use of ad in English in bihar. Even people who know English won't see you as an alpha male/female if you act all high and mighty in such demographic. Bhihar needs someone who can bow down rub dirt on his cut and carry on. Not I join you or I fight along with you.

Alright, which one of you is Pushpam? Chaudary ki chori chunav lad rahi hai. Kuch angrezi ka naam hai party ka. Udne wale ghode ka button daba dena bus. There is a website, smartphone app, big mission statements and demands for donations.

And yet, just lists current problems & their (her) plan to 'challenge' the system.
That's it. No real plan of action or agenda for change.

Just another fresh political science graduate with freshly read ideas from a Karl Marx book. Props to the guy who came up with the Unicorn/Pegasus thing. A little humour in politics is always appreciated. People who are mocking her, should not forget who our PM is and how he became PM. A whole lot of educated mass became ""zombie bhakt""

This party needed attention and look like she is getting a lot of attention with this advertisement. 1) people are shitting on this add by saying that they'll never win. Why ? This is a democracy, people complain about dynasty politics but when people try to break there's hue and cry. 

2) people are not really talking about this persons qualifications or the qualifications of the members of the party ? Are they the iipm of politics or do they really mean it ? What are their promises in the manifesto ? Red & Black. Nice Wow......
That's a new take for any political party......
Won't succeed though unless they reach the ground massess......
Otherwise it is absolutely nothing...... Is this anime party with that unicorn? This is cringy as fuck and the party sounds like a fucking cult More power to her!!! Lol... Looks like it is just her from reading the website.  Where do they get the funding for this? There was a Mahila Empowerment Party that sprung up during the Karnataka election also. 'Plurals' is kinda tongue twister word. Slightly difficult to pronounce for even folks who are comfortable with English. Baqi logon ki baat door ki hai. optimism?

Also the name is dumb. You want to win in India's most backward state with Plurals as party name? Seriously? Okay you got our attention...can we have her for AMA ? Is the party symbol unicorn? LMAO! Wtf....Bihar is one of the top illiterate states aur inki audicity ki CM candidate bhi declare kr Diya.
Bhala kisko samajh aayega There's one main issue with this ad. If you Google plurals you don't get anything about this party . As a digital marketer I'm baffled by their strategy of choosing such a poor name for the party On women's day.. Very apt This rooks like a ""The Room"" remake with female lead instead of Tommy Wissieu I rather place my bet on seeing pig with wings. I'm skeptical of any political party and corporation. Don't think this party has any chance of winning anything in Bihar. Doesn't ring any bells with the voters. Though I appreciate the effort.

Visited the place recently. It's literally like traveling back in time. The people are conservative af. Women are expected to behave in a certain manner, do everything for all the members of the family, eat last and what not.

And as far as the political part goes, I got the feel that it's more about the change in the attitude of the people than just the ruling party. The places are super duper polluted. Like the whole city was a dumpyard. Litter everywhere. Dusty air. No wonder two of the major cities of Bihar featured in the top 15 most polluted cities of the world. 
The roads were bad, yes but there was literally no road sense. People drove on both sides of road, no regard for any traffic rules. And the honking was directly proportional to the acceleration. Literally blow your brains out noise on the road. Yeah... no... ""Plurals"" won't resonate with the masses in *any* state. If you have waste time explaining what your party's name even means... then you've lost half the campaign battle already. Shieeeet. Saw this in the morning but didn’t care to read anything and flipped the page thinking it’s a soap opera/news channel ad. (Not that they are different ) Why does this looks like a cult? This is weird. She's a London based daughter of Binod Chaudhary, a JDU leader. 

Answers a lot of questions regarding funding. This is basically like what OnePlus is to Vivo/Oppo. Looks Promising... She is JD(U) leader Vinod Chaudhary's daughter. No wonder why she came into politics. 

Link: https://shrts.in/bJV9 Saw her educational qualification, atleast she has credibility to become a CM unlike the remaining bozos. Even though i know her laptop promise is 100% fake, i would still vote for her. The chances of her making rash and stupid decisions are really less compared to the other bozos. Also, the chances of her making calculated and logical decisions for the benefit of people is really high. Hope she improves her marketing though. No offense but she looks like a snake,that smile atleast! Eeeeee plurarls kaa hota hai ??? Is it April 1st already? This colour scheme is not working. She looks she's back after having sold her soul to the devil. Yeah right, you are going to win Bihar with a english language ad.


1st step to form a political party in Bihar is to pick a caste (or few aligned castes)

2nd step, is to rope in some bahubalis.

3rd step, is to use whatever leverage your party gets, to make money. C'mon Bihar give us the experience of being a Super Power's Neighbour . From Nepal . I'll let her deal with my snake. Pehle caste bataiye
Phir ideology bataiye
Phir ye bataiye ki opening propaganda kya hoga

Aap chronology ko samajhiye In Russia Putin pays for certain opposition campaigns to run .  Gives him opportunity to claim they are all sorts of things.  Will have to see how this plays out but looks like her Jdu votebabk isn’t very important for all parties Plurals HAVE arrived. Sounds as apolitical and sanghi as AAP."

He's definitely working his ass off, full marks for effort and commitment Udhav Thackrey has been very good so far KCR.

He did great work while he was at Ajmer. Made history as the only non-Muslim candidate to win a majority from Tonk Rajasthan against a muslim candidate. Kerala CM and TN health minister , they make sure that the job they do reaches the intended audience and also they engage with the people directly (via social media ofc).

There are a few administrative officers in Bangalore who are doing a good job as well Late Manohar Parrikar.
The guy was the reason my entire village supported BJP in 2014 election. He had his own views and he never compromised with that. Even at the time of rafel he was the one from BJP to oppose modi-shaha. That's why he was transferred to Goa again. He is the best BJP CM any indian state ever got. He backed beef traders. He restricted spread of Christianity  behind social service mask. But maintained good relationship with people .

A bunch of us (various nationalities) were sitting around discussing the news, and one of my fellow indian girls was telling us about a video she saw. A young Pakistani student in China had posted it saying that air India had evacuated the Indian students in his Chinese university and that no one was coming for him. 

There was apparently an overwhelming amount of support from fellow students asking air India to evacuate all students irrespective of race. 

I mentioned that the one good thing that could come out of this virus would be a true and total support for fellowmen. And the girl said ""Pakistan isn't equipped to deal with this virus. They aren't equipped to deal with a viral fever. They could all die.. and it would be a good thing if they were all wiped out."" 
I have never felt more shocked. 

Irrespective of historical politics between our nations, hoping for an entire country to die out is horrible. This is a global pandemic and the best time to set aside all our biases and support everyone. Everyone has loved ones who we're worried about. We are all susceptible to the virus just as much as every other race. 

Let's put aside religion and take care of each other.

I'm probably going to get some hateful comments about this post anyway. But I don't care. This is me imploring that we all stand together (at a social distance, no touchy) and try to keep ourselves and our neighbors safe. Thanks for coming to my TED talk"," What an incredibly narrow minded person. Our great grandfathers were from the same nation. People in Pakistan are humans too. I personally hate both Pakistani and Indian governments but that hate shouldn’t be transferred to the people under them. Meanwhile in the Zee News Cinematic Universe:-

She said this in front of people from other nations too ? She is living abroad, did she never shop in a Pakistani shop (half the so called ""Indian shops"" are run by Pakistanis, at least here in Europe) or interact with Pakistanis abroad?

I would understand if someone within India says that, because lets face it, with the current political atmosphere in India, that would not be surprising at all. But living abroad and saying shit like this is... she is a horrible person. [deleted] [Here ya go, another thread. It is a lost cause.](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/flmmps/man_riding_motorcycle_beaten_up_in_maharashtras/) I am in two minds about this.

I do feel that we shouldn't in general dehumanize people. It *seems* grossly unfair. The wars and games between our ruling classes shouldn't destroy our humanity as individuals.

But there's also this angle: the members of a tribe (religion, nation, race, caste, ethnicity, etc.) need to be aware that the tribe's harmful actions towards others will exact a toll on them individually. For instance, if members of caste A are especially casteist and/or communal, then individuals from that group should feel the heat for it from others, even if the individual himself or herself may not be casteist or communal. Otherwise they will have that much less incentive ""fix"" their tribespeople.

I have used this principle with respect to myself. If I am hated because members of my ""tribe"" exhibit certain undesirable behaviors, then while I may not ""deserve"" it, I certainly should realize that the reaction is expected, natural, and even healthy, in a way. It gives me an incentive to fix the harmful actions of my fellow tribespeople. Hating or punishing the members for the transgressions of their tribe is a normal strategy used in tribal calculus. It may not be healthy individually or collectively to suppress this ancient instinct. Just like our instincts for revenge and sexual jealousy, it might exist for a reason. r/ABCDesis If the government allow us :). > and that no one was coming for him.

ha he'd most likely be better off staying in China Is that what they call trying Humanism? Brother you are preaching to the wrong crowd. You need to post this to other hateful subs. >	I mentioned that the one good thing that could come out of this virus would be a true and total support for fellowmen. 

The problem with these things is that they're usually expected to only go one way. It's only Indians who are expected to bend over backwards and consider humanity and finer human values, Pakistanis are never expected to return the gesture. 

Support for fellow men would also require the Pakistanis to stop sponsoring the terrorists who kill Indian civilians. At this point terrorists have killed more Indians than covid-19 has (though I expect that equation may change in a few weeks) and yet Pakistan continues to actively support terrorists.

Things have gotten to a point where despite being on the FATF grey list, which hurts their economy, they continue to support it. They're willing to let their country burn if it means Indians will die. When you have that kind of hatred emanating from that side, you can expect it to be reciprocated.

FWIW, I'd prefer for India to evacuate all students as long as the logistics allow it. What do we do after that though is an open question. Will Pakistan take back these students or simply dump them on India to treat/quarantine? Remember this is a nation that refused to accept the bodies of its own army men during Kargil, and the army is basically the organization that runs the country. It's still morally the better option and so we should have done it, but let's not bring in all these ideas of support for fellow men which only ever go one way. Nice virtue signaling Wrong sub my man. I mean there is always this one dickwad in convos like these. > Pakistan isn't equipped to deal with this virus. They aren't equipped to deal with a viral fever. They could all die.. and it would be a good thing if they were all wiped out.

486,Politics,AAP’s woeful response to the Delhi communal violence reflects the limit of its welfare politics,https://scroll.in/article/954991/aaps-woeful-response-to-the-delhi-communal-violence-reflects-the-limit-of-its-welfare-politics,," So the argument is that the DMs could have commanded the police or the armed forces but didn't. The DMs didn't do that or that's what's being said. Also, there was no formal request from AAP. 

What does AAP have to say about it? I'm sure someone would have asked it of them. That's not it. What he did was deliberate. His silence on genocide and granting permission to police against Kanhayia.

He was expected to be on ground to protest against the genocide, he didn't even held a press conference against it.

This all was a message to gain more votes, he want's to expand and don't want to lose any votes he can score on, even if people who support bhagwa terrorism. He made it clear that he is not against muslim genocide so that he can be more popular.

He is a **snake**

His primary motive is his political carrier, not what he projects, the idea of being anti-corruption and righteous. 

If not criticized he had no problem playing the caste politics, *mai baniya hu mujhe vote do*. His rajya sabha nomination are also shady It was pretty clear he sold RS seat for money like BSP does , Also they both share same caste as Kejriwal.

[OPINION | Arvind Kejriwal Sold Rajya Sabha Seats for Money: Mayank Gandhi](https://www.news18.com/news/opinion/opinion-arvind-kejriwal-sold-rajya-sabha-seats-for-money-mayank-gandhi-1621639.html)

[In AAP Settling For 2 Guptas For Rajya Sabha, A Debt And Thank You Note](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/in-aap-settling-for-2-guptas-for-rajya-sabha-a-debt-and-thank-you-note-1796021)

And above all we should not forget why people left AAP on first place : There is no AAP it's AK, the party itself is pretty anti-democratic,  Arvind Kejriwal does not allow anyone to come forward other than him, their is no ideology just AK himself.

But my problem is something bigger than that, my problem is the fact that indians no matter their political inclination they all tend to be **Bhakts** Just like sanghies blindly support Narendra/BJP we have their counter part here too who are blind bhakts of AK. We should be neutral and chose whatever is best, even if you vote for them you should not become bhakt for them. 

Throughout the history of india indians have done this and it always result into disaster, we should follow our own moral compass not our *führer.* At the end of the day, their priority is keeping the power and money. Everything else is secondary or for the show. >""woeful response to the Delhi communal violence reflects the limit of its welfare politics""

The reason ""communal violence"" is propagated on the population by a political party is primary due to lack of proper education.....AAP is focusing on providing proper education. 

The only thing AAP could of had done differently was AAP MLA's going to the streets and sitting right in the middle of the road where the riots was happening. 

And you know what would of had happened to them if they did that; they would of been killed on the spot. The reason for this is that the riots were started by men brought in from UP. BJP learned from the Gujarat riots not to use locals. 

They would of been killed the same way Congress EX MP Ehsan Jafri was murdered in 2002 Gujarat riots 

https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/The-five-men-who-killed-Ehsan-Jafri/article14427953.ece

*The five accused who have been convicted for lynching the former MP are Yogendrasinh Shekhawat, Jayesh Jingar, Krishnakumar, Jayesh Parmar and Naran Tank. All of them were sentenced to life impriosnment for 14 years.* True, AK didn't show courage during the riots, but I don't think he could have controlled them without the police. The most he could have done is some noise. AAP has 62 MLAs.
We know the police are not under their control, but all of those 62 have got at least 10 security guards.
If they all would have gone together with their protection force on the day of events, at least those 620 would have protected few lives. Assuming the police guards feel ashamed in front of the minister to act.

But all of those 62 chose to sit and enjoy Twitter. Mob of both the sides was out their in numbers..its was communal frenzy. What can AAP will do. If riots continued for 3 days in a national capital means police stand downed. Lets be honest kapil mishra is not a big leader to go this far unless he had the blessings of amit shah. More and more anti CAA protests are taking place and riots is to instill fear in em that's why all that happened and police dont have the orders to stop it What has happened is that BJP, by crying about identity politics the loudest, has made sure all other parties are now shy to be seen as engaging in identity politics. In this way they have made sure that all parties have ceded ground to them and they can now play identity politics themselves to their heart's content. If a party can win 54% of the votes in a city, it has the political capital to intervene. Who knows, maybe a big supporter backed intervention and a ""call for peace"" movement could have become a launchpad for kejri on the national scene again. One possibility is that AAP was not prepared how to handle this. They have learnt to suppress their natural instincts and now they do things while keeping the brand imagery in mind. Due to that, they couldn't decide in time on what their next step should be branding wise and by then the ship had already sailed. [deleted]"

After the first Delhi shootings, Arnab Goswami and Republic TV were trying to spin it as the act of a simple, 'provoked' Indian with the hashtag #StopProvokingIndia. If a peaceful protest is apparently deserving of a violent response, then why bother with politeness? Call a spade a spade and a fascist a fascist. Where would you draw the line? Completely agree with her. The rules of the game have changed. As long as we are NOT provoking or encouraging violence, these tactics are fine to counter hate mongers like Arnab and others. cue the RW now bemoaning ""hawwww Liberal Bollywoodiya bAdDd!!!""

edit: the responses on the ""other discussions"" sub are pure gold, as expected. I agree. In a state where situation is so bad that 'journalists' berate the people of an entire state for making their choice (which he doesn't agree with) in an election, on national TV, politeness has no role to play.

Being ""impolite"" to BJP supporters isn't going to change their minds. It will infact further polarize them to the right.

We are supposed to come up with a strong national level alternative to BJP/Modi, simply abusing them and their supporters isn't going to cut it. we need to be careful in speaking about politics in our country. Why do I feel like these people are playing straight into the BJP's hands and dividing people further. We need better people representing leftist ideologies.

Edit: sorry I meant liberal ideologies. Not leftist. Just imagine a Muslim person saying this and adding allah ho akbar to it lol Well said. Every individual with conscience should speak up. Enough of hatred spread. Agreed I don't agree with this, if you talk about Gandhi on one side and do this on another. Quite hypocritical and disrespectful to Gandhi https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/supreme-court-shaheen-bagh-protest-public-road-block-1644938-2020-02-10 This will cause nothing but further divide. Ah yes.... The great political analyst, economist, environmentalist, tech mogul, Swara Bhasker is always right. attention crazy , deprived of work, career at stake,  politics as career in mind, All this has already been said and done by leftists. The fundamental problem is that they are always enraged and never patient or calm. I pity on you, I really do. Rightists are no gods. They are idiots too. Downvote, report, do whatever the hell you want. This left vs right drama needs to stop. This has come down to people's ego now. While the poor in the interiors of the country suffer, these protests do no good to them. Be it Modi, Shah, Kamra or Swara, everyone just needs to shut up now. Why she a thing on Reddit? This is not Twitter or your family group. r/India needs better standards. What next? Kartik Aryan on economy? Karan Johar on space-tech? [removed] Aww Swara baby got no chills In my opinion she is a failed actor and she needs to fuck right off  she has no work in her hand . I don't like the way she incites listeners to engage in arguments with our elders. 

I want to improvise that if you think there will be tangible benefits to it, only then do it, otherwise don't let her cause ideological divides within your family.

Also, hate the way she's shaking her head, my intuition is that she is trying to cash in on the heated sentiments she is rousing and this is not something heartfelt. Swara is a fame craving bitch irrespective to whichever side you lean to."

I don't doubt they will get votes. Indian voters are getting tired of BJP too. But we don't have a real alternative. Congress is spineless, the same MPs that were in Congress jumped ship to BJP when given the chance, and they will come back to Congress if BJP doesn't do good. He is not very mature and has made a lot of mistakes and unnecessary enemies along the way and hence losing credibility. 

However, he has shown an impressive amount of learning and improvement. It will take time for him to build credibility at national level and hopefully he gets better with time. I dont live in Delhi but hear from my friends stories of good governance by him. As for freebies, socialist programs from a surplus government don't hurt anyone and are good for everyone in long run. Telling from personal experience. /r/enlightenedcentrism, but unironically. AAP is the same, Kejriwal has grown

He isn't the same idiot who complained 24 hrs about BJP and Modi

That's what they should do. Keep up the good work and not fall in the traps of Hindutva. I am sure AAP will and should return to run Delhi going forward. I honestly have faced no difference but whenever I interact with maids, security guards, Uber drivers, etc., it feels like their welfare schemes have genuinely helped them. I don't think I am in any position to criticise any of them.

AAP has surely improved the quality of education in Government schools bringing in better infrastructure, more engaging parent interactions, etc.

They should not align with INC, BJP, BSP, SP, etc., because all these parties have had a history, at some point or the other, of corruption. It will take years for AAP to gain the footing of even SP or BSP but I don't see that as a bad thing. And support the abrogation of Article-370 and abolishing the statehood of Kashmir while demanding the same for Delhi. Nice touch AAP please bring French secularism to India. i love kejriwal ❤️ I don't think Kejriwal's ideology is issue for any voter. It will take some skills and a control on ego to spread beyond Delhi. Till now AAP hasn't managed to build presence in any other metro which would happily accept his brand of politics. They are literally just Congress that can implement schemes.

They pander to the times with no real ideology. It works as long as you keep delivering.

They are center right not center He is a populist. Today i'll take him over anyone in the country because he is way better than others however i don't think his policies of distributing freebies will work in long term. This is perfect centrism- enabling fascism. 🔔

He is as opportunistic as one politician can get, its just he is going one extra mile on development that's why he bit bearable!


>Whether it was supporting Balakot air strikes and Article 370 move in Kashmir, staying away from JNU and Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests at Shaheen Bagh, or chiding Pakistan for interfering in the Delhi election – Arvind Kejriwal is cautiously redrawing and refuelling the centre in Indian politics.

He asked for proof on Balakot air strike. He stayed away from JNU & CAA protests cause Delhi elections were near and he didn't wanted any controversy. He is still 'anti-national' liberal and opportunistic politician. Indian Bernie Sanders."

I was reading some of parsai's works and I'm surprised that he was able to live a long life. Back in the day, were ~~people~~ politicians more accepting? I want to hear your thoughts on this."," Except Indira all of them loved dissent. They had a spine back then too, didn’t sold out to government just for 5 years job after retirement. Politicians back then had a teeny weeny bit of morality and shame. 

If you did something bad you were chastised and made to resign from your post in fear of the public but these days, even if you openly call for discrimination and violence of a community you will not only be rewarded with a Y-level security but also the public approval. 

Hindutva/ communal polarization is one helluva drug. To be honest, while Nehru was open to criticism, and he supported Shanker over his cartoons, it was Indira's Emergency that shut down Shanker's Weekly. 

I saw the final issue of the magazine and they had a fun cartoon showing Nehru and Indira with the subtle inclination of start and end Your question assumes that these cartoonists worked under similar political and social conditions as today. Because 40 years ago, such a question wouldn’t even come up. It just didn’t occur to us then. Discounting the brief period of the Emergency, society and the political discourse was far freer and a lot more tolerant. The political class had a sense of humour, and even laughed at themselves now and then at cartoons that lampooned them. 

Times have changed, my friend. Regardless of whether some may feel insulted, it’s the sad truth that society and the political class today are a LOT more intolerant.

Didn't Owaisi and co stop her too in the stage. Why glorify that What is ""AADAB""? Tbh, she shouldn’t have uttered Pakistan word. It always leads to messy consequences, rightly so or otherwise IMO the people who actually make statements like ""Jinnah Waali Aazadi"" or ""Alag desh"" or ""Tukde-tukde"" should be the ones prosecuted first. Such statements deeply malign all the struggle and hardships our freedom fighters had to endure. The very same struggle, which has now, near 74-years later, enabled us to live on with our lives with much more independence and freedom than available back during the days of war.

As for ""Pakistan Zindabaad"", I'd say it's a dumb and a pointless statement to say the least. Dare I say it, in almost every aspect; geopolitical, social, economical- we've excelled over them. So there's no point in spreading half-truths like these. We should first concern ourselves over the issues plaguing *our* society, and later fret about how better/ worse we are compared to other states.

And no, such people shouldn't certainly be jailed- can't comment about sedition charges, but whenever we've to talk about development or progress as such, we give comparisons to first world countries. Does that insinuate us becoming ""pro-first"" world-ism? Why doesn't anybody say, ""Go to Sweeden"" or similar things then?

My boyfriend is from India and I am American.
He’s told me that in India, it’s rude to refuse food, and that hosts will often push you to eat more than you might otherwise need/want.

The problem is that I am recovering from an eating disorder and it’s really important for me that I listen to my fullness cues otherwise I’m super prone to relapse. 

It’s also troubling because many members of his family are overweight and I am really nervous at the thought of visiting them and being pressured to eat more than I am comfortable with.

I want to enjoy my time and also not feel pressured to overeat, while not coming across as rude.

How can I politely refuse food if I am full? Is it really as impossible to do so politely as my boyfriend has made it seem? Thanks!"," ""Aaj mera upwas hain""

Just learn this phrase Feel free to refuse. A lot of Indians don’t understand boundaries and therefore it’s upto you to have one.  It's a little frustrating, to be honest. I understand what you're trying to express, I used to be in a similar state by being an overeater/emotional overeater. Especially when my mom or aunts would pour in more food in my plate than required. You could do a couple things depending on how close you are with them.

1. You could express yourself, and open yourself to them, so they wouldn't push you any further 
2. Pretend to be ""full"" before you actually are, so when they do stuff your plate with more foods, you don't feel sick. 
Or. 
3. As soon as you're done, you run to the kitchen to leave your plate. (Wouldn't really just that, but the idea was somewhat funny.)

Hope it helps! Besides, if they care for you, (as we try to show our affection by feeding others), they'd understand what you're going through and wouldn't be offended. 

Hope this helps! Tell them you are allergic to  carbs and vegetable oil. 

big chunk of options  will be taken off the shelf . One trick that works for me is: say you are full well before you are. They will push to eat some more, refuse it a couple of times and then have it :) Things not to do in life:

>Visit India when you are recovering from an eating disorder.

None of the advice people giving you on this sub will work when you are gonna see so much Delicious stuff and you would want to try each and every one of those. 

> How can I politely refuse food if I am full? 

You start saying ""I'm full"" when you have eaten 50% of what you want to eat! Just say ""Ewww"" at hit the hand holding the plate. ^/s Just say that you are stuffed and mentioned that you loved it. Usually works. I don’t smoke so whenever somebody offers or forces me a cigarette, I say “I just had one before coming here” haha Simple and short. Stay drama free. Put your foot down and say ""No, THANK YOU!""

Stay drama free and simple. Repeat
Say ""No, Thank You"" Arre nahi aunty pet bhar gaya aur nahi kha sakhti 

Sach main aunty pet full ho gaya. 


Isse teen chaar bar bol dijye. Tell them you or on a fast. Simple as that  just ask for a glass of water when they offer food

It works out for me Just say 'pehle aap lijiye'. Just say that you had a very late previous meal. For eg, if you're invited over dinner, tell them that you had a very late lunch. nahi chahiye ji. any karl rock fans up in this bitch?"

You think the economy, the politics, the state, can be better managed and you have thoughts, theories and ideas on how.

So wise men and women of India, what's preventing you from taking matters into your own hands? 

Why do you allow yourself to be governed poorly (say)? Or, are you satisfied?"," One, I don't want to go to jail. 

Two, a good proportion of dumb people means that my politics have to be dumb too, and something that will appeal to dumb minds. My dumb logic has to be right. This is very difficult, and only truly dumb politicians or truly smart politicians can pull this off. The acting level required is just too much.

Politics is too much of a commitment in a developing country. Real smart, committed idealistic people were once in politics. Most of us better educated, more intelligent people **today** are too practical to waste our lives in something where we are likely to fail. In our area there are a lot of educated middle class people who stood for elections, both local and national level. No one voted for them. These were people who are visible in local drives like trash cleaning, vaccination drives and other sundry matters. But no one votes for them. It is either BJP or Congress or some other established party. So its no use unless you have a lot of money to blow in deposit. I am not ready to sell my morality to the highest bidder yet. The IAS is an infinitely better option if you want the country to change. They are the ones who implement the policy in the first place rather than the politicians who are just there to sign. If anyone's name is Arnab please don't answer this question.

(Check out OPs username)

Edit: /s What is preventing you from joining politics? 
As for me, I'm just part of the pipeline that everyone goes through. A sheep, not a leader. I follow or remain ignorant. It's true that I am sorely disappointed by the state of affairs and want things to change. But that doesn't mean I would want to join politics. I can rather become an occasional activist and focus on my original passion. Joining politics needs a lot of commitment and thus time, which would just lead me to stray from my actual passion. So yeah, occasional activism works better for me. I am an introvert. I can't go around campaigning. Nor do I have funds it needs even give a decent fight. And I can't go around begging for funds too. But if I do get elected, say through RS, I would be willing to join politics and do the job. I think it's not a level field with all the goons currently present. Unless you have backing of some political group (which defeats the purpose), it is nearly impossible for a middle class guy to risk my life including the life of my family. While I know risks and can understand we need people who can work for common people and poor, it won't go unnoticed by the corrupt that I will be exposing a lot of their shit on the way. My political opinions are illegal. A few crores. The people of this country elected Modi twice. I can understand wanting to show congress that its hold on the nation is done for. But electing someone - who doesn't even have a degree, can't hold his own in unscripted interviews, believes in ancient Hendu Stronk bullshit etc - a *second time,* makes me not want to do *anything* for this country. [removed] I was a member and still support a small party called Loksatta. They contested MLA elections in 2013 and Bengaluru municipal elections in 2015. Our candidates always came third or lower (behind BJP and Congress). It was disheartening. We put in money from our own pockets. Campaigned on the issues that matter. And yet, I saw first hand, how the so-called educated voters still view elections with a communal mind (religion and caste). I saw BJP and Congress workers openly bribing families in slums. That's when I realized it's hard. Delhi and AAp's victory was an exception, not the norm. India will remain a third world country because much of its people vote based on all the wrong priorities. The day voters hold leaders accountable for real important matters will be the day parties like AAP or Loksatta gain nationwide acceptance. But sadly I do not see that happening anytime soon. 1. Most elections are determined by campaign expenditure 
2. People don't have the time, knowledge, awareness or critical thinking to assess their options 
3. Politics has always been dirty and there is a very real chance of losing life and limb if you flip off the local mafia which is often also the local politician's family

&#x200B;

You can still donate to the candidate you favour, if not in money you can volunteer, join their campaign and use your skills to help them win. Also, I am useless. I am honest and cannot dupe people. I like being alive I am some one who believe that an Individual has to think about his own development and making himself strong financially,mentally etc while not at all obstructing the development of fellow individuals . All these individuals make up the country and inturn mean that country will develop along with them . It is such a development where we no longer need any leader . Thus i stay away from politics . I know it sound unreal and cringy, but that is what i think . Have you joined politics?
If not, what prevents you from joining? Iam not a yes person, politics requires yes people I need a godfather to enter in politics Just because one is disappointed with something, it doesn't warrant participation. If you aren't happy with a meal, you don't try to become the chef. You can complain and try to set things right or you just go where you find better food. There are millions who are sick of this country, not all of them are going to join politics. And just joining politics will in no way give matters into your own hands. I'm not 'allowing' myself to be governed poorly because I exercised my right and voted for whom I believed in, the problem is that person/party didn't win which is beyond my control. But is it really feasible for a graduate to take politics as a career? Don't have public speaking skills [deleted] >So wise men and women of India, what's preventing you from taking matters into your own hands? 

Can you tell me (or point to some document) the path I should follow if I want to do this? Assuming that I am a nobody in politics or social/public work. I want a team of well determined persons...people whom I can trust...those who can go without bread for a day if needed...guess it's only me..plus I have no money...without money you cannot do anything substantial...if you go to the root of problems...maybe your brain will pop out of your head...if not you have underestimated the problem itself ....because individual capacities are only marginally different compared to the problems we are facing...  
People like Gandhiji can bring a change but they come once in many years...until large number of individuals are committed to become gandhi themselves (given only few succeed)...there is no hope even if you join politics...playing a moral game is a titanic task Joining politics, aahh, I used to think about this. But when I saw the ground reality i.e. the issues of each constituency differ on the basis of caste/religion and class issues + the very fundamental issues of roti kapda makaan which have existed right from independence. 

Most of our citizenry hasn't been provided with the bare basics i.e. Food security, employment opportunities, law and order, and education.

Most of us fight to fulfill all these needs.
Inme se, jo bhi populist politicians provide/promise karte hain, vote unhi ko milta hai. (basically violating election spending norms all the time, everywhere)

Fir votes milte hain religion and caste based - state sanctioned benefits k basis pe.  
So one needs resources, popularity, and good presence (on stage and in the news)

Plus if one talks sense like how farm loan waivers are bad for the economy (empirically proven), then they'll be shown the door by the voters as they fall for the narrative created by opportunist politicians.

Also, very few voters can visualize the long term effects of any policy pursued by a government. Jab tak uske positive effects dikhte hain, another government gets the credit for it and vice versa. Public memory is actually very short lived. 

So unless we improve the standard of education and thereby critical thinking, I believe, we, as a populace, deserve the politicians we get. After all, politicians are a mirror for our society.



So I'll rather watch the fall of Rome from the comfort of my home,on WiFi. :P Itna Ameer nahi hai Mera baap Come from middle class family, don't have much backup. Need to work to build backup Money, personality, and mainly money. My bad habit of telling the truth !"

Rahul is a nice man. a good human being. may not be the best politician but doesnt need to be. his good character is enough. thanks rahul this guy is genuinely a nice person , her brother as is mentioned in the article is a pilot now cause of him , he paid for everything and asked them never to reveal it , Modi would have milked it dry , that is the difference between the two. [deleted] He regularly talked to her brother and encouraged him to pursue his dream career in air force Modiji bina diye hi chilla chilla ke bolte hai😜, like a pornstar fake scream Good person. If congress want to come back to power. They have to let go of the family thinking and choose a strong leader and a great speaker. Apparently people in India do not go after education and qualifications in a leader. Majority just want a leader who can give long buttery and dreams speeches. Nice :) Frankly speaking, we never gave Rahul Gandhi a chance. We always ridiculed him because of his errors while speaking. And soon, everybody started thinking of him as a joke. I'm not saying he would have been a good or a bad leader, but we never even saw him as one. I cam to this realisation a while ago of how many people don't clear their interviews because of their  communication skills. Same thing happened with this guy, but at a massive level. The smooth talker got the job, but doesn't know what to do XD

PS: Not a congress supporter, just my observation. To survive in politics one need to be ruthless. Rahul is lacking that. That is a flaw with the existing political set up. But unfortunately political commentators are considering that as a negative trait. Because most of them expect a leader to be a dictatorial monarch.

I oppose Congress's policies. Not a big fan of Rahul. But somehow I have a soft corner for him and believe that he is a honest person. What a good man.. might not be a good politician, but definitely a good man India doesn't deserve a Prime Minister like Rahul.

India deserves Modi.

We have so badly ruined our politics that it seems 'unnatural' to us when a politician shows decency and kindness. Everyone here is like 'He is too good of a human being to be a good politician'. 

Take a moment to see just how messed up that is. RG lost his closest family members at a young age. He never tried to gain emotional sympathy or attention out of it. Unlike Modi who still gets attention and sympathy out of having been a tea maker in the past. It's not surprising to me that he did this kind act. I'm gonna be the 'that guy' here. Here's a quote from the movie- Parasite:

""They are so rich yet they are so nice.
They are nice because they are rich."" Quite happy to see this forum is genuine and not filled with BJP IT cell. (Like TOI comments section) He is agood man but incompetent politician and administrator. Cause that's what heroes do. I came across this somewhere a few months ago. I think that he also helped Nirbhaya's brother to become a pilot. Rahul is a really great guy, I liked him since a long time. One should also check out Gaurav Gogoi, a great rising young politician. Nobody would say such a thing about modi, not even his mother. Says about the character of a man....i have always believed him to be a nice person and preferred him over the two goons we got....my friends say that he is stupid but i reply that ""i would rather take a stupid man over murderous lunatics not that he is stupid"" Bhakt nahi maanenge Good people aren't really cut out for politics...agar modi ji hotay to roz ek tweet kartay family kay saath What's wrong with this dude?like I don't see a flaw on this guy Empathy isn't dead Cant believe the people of India chose a rioter,chaiwala,unsecular leader instead of this guy Check out the articles comment section! Politics need to change from when politicians say who is the worst party, don't vote for them to look at the improvements we have done and vote for us. And frankly at some places i I can see it changing. There is progress. It's slow but it's there. Read comments under the news source. Rahul, you are a good man. Thank you. Dayum BJP wasted their 4 fully qualified future election candidates and he thanks Rahul. I usually don't participate in political slugfests (!) but I wonder what his constituents have to say about that?

Especially victim's families who have had no communication with their decades-old MP! 

Again, nothing to take away from the ""humanitarian"" aspect of it, if at all it can be called that! *everyone liked that.* I'm not pro congress, that's what I think at least. but since so many of you say he's nice but not a good politician. why? what doesn't make him a good politician?  his inability to argue? are his plans bad? I'm just asking out of curiosity :) His character was assassinated by BJP. I was their strategy to gain popularity. Just like they did with Nehru, calling such a great man a “womaniser” and what not. Everyone saying he is not a good politician haven't seen RG transform from his younger days in politics when he used to make blunders in speaking. His 2014 campaign was absolute trash and this is the image of RG that most here have held on to. 

In the run up to 2019-LokSabha, RG went on a world tour, met and talked with people around the world, and established himself worldwide to an extent as India's potential PM. He also helped INC win 5 states (I know what happened in KA and what's happening in MP, but hey atleast they won then.) , 4 of them in the BJP's hindi heartland. 

Then he went around many universities and had open question-answer sessions with students where he brilliantly and confidently answered all of their questions. On the congress youtube channel, they had two episodes of 'Apni Baath Rahul Ke Saath' in which RG talked to youth in one episode and some people of the working class in another.

Come the Lok Sabha campaign. INC releases their manifesto which listed their promises in a great way and RG promised to carry out all of these. RG started campaigning in the south where his rallies were longer due to the translation required. Then he went on north where in every rally he would have approximately 20 minute speeches mainly speaking about unemployment, demonitization, and his NYAY. (Here is where he could have done it a little more aggressively as the fiercest statement would be Chowkidaar chor hai, never more than that.)

And lets not forget, he had several interviews with various tv channels, and he occasionally vlogged on his youtube channel. He also held regular press conferences. On the other hand, Narendra didn't have a single unscripted interview whilst also refraining from saying even a word in his press conference.

TL;DR: RG used to be an inept politician but he improved a lot in the run up to the 2019 election. He could have potentially been a competent PM. I think he reverse psychologyied them to not praise him so that they'll Here for the salt 🧂 😂 simp Excellent! Kudos to him Awesome!! Nice Incoming bhakt arguement

*arey bro tujhe pata nahi hai rahul gandhi kitna ganda aadmi hai usne ek ladki ka rape kiya tha apne dosto ke saath phir us ladki ka kabhi pata nahi chala* Guilt perhaps? I remember watching the December protests (after the rape) and noticing no one from Congress / UPA was responding to the outrage. In fact the protestors at Rashtrapati bhavan were dispersed using water cannons. Clearly the government understood mood of the nation and promptly shifted her to Singapore, knowing her death here would worsen the situation. 
Secondly, he was in a position of authority to bring in a legislation to treat minors as adult in heinous crimes. From all news reports it was clear that the juvenile was the most cruel and remorseless criminal, who actually pulled out her intestines... and due to legalities, he walked away without any penal consequences. Be a good man, but don't go around trying to prove it. Among all of this chaos, its nice to see that some mortality prevails even in the most challenging situation. This action, will speak louder than words—unless BJP comes with a mind-boggling narrative. Okay it's nice and all that, but this 2017 news. What's the point of patting his back now? Someone find a Modi article praising idk someone If the Gandhi family leaves congress forever, I may one day vote for it.
But currently, Congress doesn't deserve to exist. how it came out now then? no more a secret??? just curious.. This seems quite suspicious. Why they all of a sudden decided to reveal it? I can understand the sentiment to keep it a secret but it's hard to believe a news story like this. Especially with all the false news spreading these days. Find it hard to trust any of these politicians. [removed] And you believe it ? Corrupt politician pays money to gain sympathy from voters . Never heard of this before.

This happened under congress rule. One of the accused committed suicide under congress establishment. There were delays in providing medical support to nirbhaya , that is also a failure of the government. 

Gangsters like Dawood, and terrorist like Hafiz also do a lot for their communities, are they nice people too? Pappu Ans his family have systematically looted the country and everybody knows that. He way more neech human being than nice guy. Papu Aaj Pass Hogaya ;) ! Then why is he saying it out and getting published in online articles. Sorry can't believe it wasn't intentional.

Guys he was not kidding. If your rivals respect you, you are doing great Shiv Sena? It's like Himmler praising the Brits for kicking Hitler's ass. What's happening? And for that reason only , hope Kejriwal Wins .. hope Delhities don't vote for those who try to divide us Indian's .. Don't forget that shiv sena stopped the mumbai arey shed tree cutting. 
   And paused the bullet train project because who the fuck would want to go to ahmedabad. It should have never been Mumbai -ahmedabad but
Mumbai-delhi these are most important routes.
  And because of modi not much ships dock at mumbai he moved them to gujrat motherfucker stelling our money by moving trade to his state.
     Many people complain of sena being a gunda sarkar how it has ties to don type people of mumbai. But then this has been past. But then it is far better then supporting bjp.
  Now the ruling gov is a 3 party of sena ,ncp and congress. This is far better then bjp whose CM used to say ME PUNHA YEIL ME PUNHA YEIL ( i will come back again) thank god he isnt cm now.
Because of bjp maharashtra is in its  highest debt in its entire history.

     Most of maharashtra people are in support of AAP wish even we get this much facilities and had a CM like him. lol yeah no still fuck you shiv sena >**Hindu-Muslim politics**

Before making new allies ShivSena used to be headmaster of school of Hindu-Muslim politics and BJP master in Maharashtra. Now headmaster has gone on leave and will return on duty after some time but at this time the whole school is in the hand of BJP.

ShivSena is in quagmire. It had to quit this kind of politics in pressure (of allies). I think this is not good for ShivSena. It's Hindutva votes would transfer to the BJP and BJP would become more powerful in Maharashtra.

EDIT: Biggest gainer in this game is NCP and then BJP and even after winning CM seat I would see ShivSena as a loser because they have lost ideology on which their party was based on. Looks who is talking."

It's almost impossible for a consumer based economy to recover from absolute lack of demand.
More people losing jobs,- less money to spend- lack of demand - less growth of economy -. A vicious cycle.
Hopefully they consult actual experts this time. Probably his biggest test since he became PM. Either blame Corona and let the economy go to the dogs or listen to experts and bring them on board to revive the situation. And don't even think about letting our FM handle the issue, she'll start screaming at everyone who questions her. He won't do shit economy wise!

It's all gonna be about CAA/NRC and election rallies once this is over. Of all things lacking, political courage is not one of them.

Little wonder the Govt is opening up to hot money like ODI via FPI (and prolly even p notes will enter the scene soon), gives billions in tax cuts to chutiyas who in turn feed the electoral bonds but is woefully nonchalant about the unemployed and the farmers. Modi is even stealing money from LIC and Bhakt have no problem with it. Raghuram Rajan was an honest man who refused to bow down to Modi's demand to extract money from RBI.

I've been saying this since 1999. Heck even Bollywood made movies on this same issue over and over again. We respected Army to the core but also kept them on pedestal for these crimes as well. We never were blind supporters of anybody. That's why we were free to question every institution without fear. Today people say ""you are crazy to question Army"" and institutions? Well very convenient, who gave you that message, the perpetrators and it's supporters I guess. Well a Rapist never likes to be called out for the crimes he did, why would he support the idea of questions?

Rest of the points, you described India in general since 2014. And these same people had problems when petrol prices were 5 rupees high. Now they don't question even when it is +50 rupees high. Vegetables and rest other commodities +100 high. Because their brain has been washed. The media, the it cell, the zero pressure govt and it's institution, the fear mongering, has made people fearful and weak. 

Don't even for a minute ever think that this attempt to shoot was to create fear among Shaheen Bagh protestors. No, they are fearless and are not afraid to die even though they are dying slowly by protesting.

 This Shooting, Kunal's Ban, Azad's arrest, Rohith's suicide, Kanhaiya's false allegation not amounting to police chargesheet, Kalburghi+Pansare+Dabholkar+Gauri Lankesh Murders, Akhlakh+Pehlu Khan's Murders, Child Asifa's Rape in Temple, Judge Loya's not so mysterious Death, Bhima Koregaon investigation pulled off, etc etc...everything has been done to show the people of India, DON'T REPEAT WHAT THEY DID OR YOU'LL FACE THE SAME FATE. My dad is an air force vet, and he himself questions the morality of soldiers who indulge in such heinous activities and soil the army's name. However, he never blames the army, he targets that specific group of soldiers who have done this. Remember, the day we stop questioning our own army, we become Pakistan. u/WhenBlueMeetsRed you can post your bigotry and hatred here instead of sending private messages :) We all want peace of mind .

Not knowing all the facts and choosing sides or forming opinions is worse. [deleted] You know bin Laden said the same thing to the victims of 911 to justify the attack. We pay our taxes, if government misuses it then it's not fault. We are civilians. That doesn't mean I support human rights violations, but it is wrong to attack civilians. So what do I do if I don't believe what you believe in? Because you didn't say why you believe what you believe.

I do support your right to peacefully protest though.

Also protest were supposed to be about CAB, NRC now with free Kashmir you are giving arsenal to right wing mob who will use this to show how unpatriotic the left wing is. ""Indian occupation of Kashmir"" 
Lol Aaj tujhe detain kiya. Kal main same poster uthaunga. Kitna detain karenge. Karlo jitna mann kare. Main ghoom kar wapas aaunga! 

✊🏼 “Indian Occupation of Kashmir” ... Gas Daafa. You have my support /u/busy_bee_busy . Speak your truth. [deleted] I support my Army and my nation and you can fuck off I think martial law in Kashmir is much better way to phrase what is happening. It gets your point across much better

However this was really well put

>To all the people who are ‘apolitical’ and take a certain pride in being politically illiterate. You have the worst kind of illiteracy; you don’t hear, don’t speak, nor participate in the political events. I am afraid of people like you. You are like dead fish going with the flow of a river, a river in which blood of countless innocent lives flows I don't want violence in Kashmir, but I don't want a free Kashmir either. It's a natural barrier for enemies ""To all the Indians who want to distance yourself""

I mean, aren't you doing the same here? Aren't you distancing yourself from reality, which is that India will always be an imperialist, revanchist nation? Our complete absence of any base culture is going to make us permanently lust for lebensraum to fulfill some glorious historical ideal or other.

I don't disagree with anything you've said in your post, but I am disappointed in the Indian left's continued obsession with keeping the Indian project going. This nation's existence will always be a threat to Kashmiris, adivasis, the north-east, the list goes on. We - the left, not liberals - should proudly throw ourselves behind the worthy goal of dismantling India and replacing it with a union. 

There was no hope for reform within the British Empire - there is no hope for reform within India. The sooner we accept this, the better it is, for our own mental health and for future progress."

Considering the current need of our country, I hope politicians will then focus more on the needs of people.
I think this did happen in the recent Delhi elections. AAP focused more on work and less on religion. India would become a great country DEMOCRACY WILL HAPPEN You know why parties do it? Because it works in India. Our ""culture"" is often the problem which the parties see as an opportunity. The citizens of the country are just as much a part of the problem as the political parties as you can clearly see even on Reddit sometimes. They will have nothing to talk about Religion and cast based politics should be banned. Soliciting votes in the name of castes or religion was banned by the SC when it still had a spine. Elections are a secular process irrespective of how much the cow scat-munching shaka rats and their piped pipers hate it.


[The Supreme Court bars political parties from seeking vote in the name of religion including Hindutva.](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/hindutva-religion-election-supreme-court-952668-2017-01-02) It's actually banned by a s.c judgement. India becomes superpower overnight."
508,Politics,FYI - Arnab Goswami was in my flight again this morning while returning from lucknow... I again asked him politely if he wants to have a honest discussion he with his verbal arrogant hand jester he asked me to move away & I did that...,https://twitter.com/kunalkamra88/status/1222387859715510272?s=09,," What are the odds that they end up on the same flight again?

Also which airline is this since Indigo banned Kunal? I really wish the GOI had banned Vijay Mallya and Nithyananda from flying with the same speed that they did with Kamra Kaun kisko stalk kar raha hai bhai? ""[Hand Jester](https://www.folkmanis.com/DSN/wwwfolkmaniscom/Commerce/ProductImages/mn1_000251.jpg)""

r/BoneAppleTea material there /r/madlads *gesture (grammar Nazis unite) Other people would like to travel in peace and quiet. Uh in all honesty, if someone approached me on a flight to start a 'debate' I'd probably ignore them as well. Not saying Arnab did the right thing but seeing the video, Kamra was just out of line trying to get a reaction. It just made him look bad and gave more ammunition to the opposition. Please don't say Arnab does the same thing on his show. You don't have to get in the mud with him to prove your point. Be the better person. Could someone explain to me why Arnab Goswami should be pressured into having a conversation with someone with whom he does not wish to at the time? 
I get that the comedian is mocking him with his own words, but when someone is traveling and is on a flight, should their personal space not be respected? 
I hardly find this funny because it seems to me like a cheap jab at someone who does not wish to comment at a particular time when anything he could have said could be taken in a wrong light.
Personally, I am of the opinion that this anchor rarely speaks of relevant news and if he does it's hard for him to continuously say relevant information for a while and it's actually better that he's silent. I don't think I can take Kamra seriously any more, especially after [this](https://twitter.com/vivekagnihotri/status/1222371368920068096?s=19) expose of him. It really shows he has built an image by being anti-modi and is not in pursuit of a true political analysis but simply uses the ""Modi Bad"" jokes to build a core fan base.

> In the interview, when asked by Kamra “Which is the most effective fake news”, I said ‘Rohith Vemula’.

> Kamra agreed and said, ‘but it worked against Modi. And how.”
“You’d sell suicide of a student to beat Modi? I asked.
“Why not? It’s all fair in politics.” Kamra said.

Stranded migrants, police brutality, economic crises are rarely mentioned in the news. Fake news continues to spread like wildfire long before it is dispelled.

Asking again because the earlier one was posted at an odd hour and didn't get much response. Please upvote for visibility!"," Personally, political awareness is like sex education. In the absence of either you have a country with the 2nd highest population in the world with no fucking opinion of themselves and no clue of what they want or expect in a govt. let alone in a significant other. I see a lot of youtube channels spreading awareness about current media situation in India. Which could be very effective, because if you speak directly about any political party people will refuse to even listen. Someone posted about how people are directly vested in  cheering for the subpar measures. And they feel offended when someone is against this.

But discrediting stupid media will be more effective. I think channels like Being Honest, Official PeeingHuman, The Lallantop, NewsLaundry are doing a good job and recently vloggers have also started speaking about stupidity of media during the pandemic."

Don’t get angry, don’t be condescending; calmly, logically bust myths, patiently explain concepts (even if it’s repeatedly) and slowly but steadily build a critical way of thought.

Hopefully this chain reaction snowballs into something worthwhile.

There is one big thing though. You are giving the impression that these things are an anomaly. You are implying that these things can be fixed. Both are wrong premises, if you were implying them.

515,Politics,Why the Supreme Court’s verdict on SC/ST quotas has created a political storm | It has upheld the state’s powers to deny reservations to Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities.,https://scroll.in/article/952687/why-the-supreme-courts-verdict-on-sc-st-quotas-has-created-a-political-storm,," Muslims and reservation are two distractions used by Indian elites to confuse people. These two are blamed for all of India's problems and people are stupid enough to believe it. 




Honestly, as a dalit I sometimes wish let them remove reservation. Then let them explain to masses how 1% Indians are getting 73% Indian wealth. Within decade there will be riots in streets and true people responsible for Indian poverty will be found out. Sizable dalit tribal population doesn't understand how system is rigged against them, they think reservation is making some difference. These guys can finally wake up. You have 22.5% reservation for 29% SC,ST in government jobs which are just 4% of total jobs. And people think this is useful or something. The main question we need to ask is where are the damn jobs ? I have said previously that Scheduled Castes and Tribes are next on the list after Muslims.

Looks like I was wrong. They're targeting everyone at the same time, just with a different approach. >The other problem is also the court’s selective affirmation of the state’s discretionary powers for providing reservations. When it comes to a decision not to provide reservations, the court feels the state has absolute discretion and need not collect data to justify this decision. But when the state wants to provide quotas, the court brings in the concept of equality and places several restrictions that dilute the discretionary power of the state. The 50% ceiling for quotas is an example of this restriction.


This alone is enough to show how the SUPREME COURT is disingenuous and biased as hell and their end goal isn't equality of any sorts. First they stopped making it compulsory for promotion in government jobs and now will give only lower level jobs to reservations.
Second they stopped compulsory arrest in SC/St act and will give pree arrest anticipatory bail to the accused.

This is the destruction of the act itself. 

Bc reservation is not the government spooge to give its a bloody constitutional right. Get that modi shah I wish the govt does try fucking around with the reservations. I truly pray that they somehow think that by making their stooges pass such judgements that they can alter the basic tenets of reservations and try curtailing it. It will be the end of this govt. Period. Come on BJP/RSS! Try messing with reservations. Please. You can do it!! Show us how tough you are. First Moslems , now SC/ST ; good job BJP judiciary /govt . Golly what is with this government? Talk to upper caste, and they believe BJP is shit and giving SC/ST everything. Talk to SC/ST, they say its upper caste party

Who the fuck voted for these mfs? I believe reservations  should be based on economic conditions and not on caste.
The reason is many sc's and st's have a high family income yet take advantage of reservation.

Are you happy with this level of governance in b/w a pandemic?"," He never touches the important details. Our PM is just a PR stunt. As much as I hate Trump, at least he comes forward everyday to talk. He talks shit but that helps media show his incompetency.
Here, our ""leader"" won't even show his face if it isn't some pre-recorded event. So when his PR stunts are ""successes"" that's all media shows most of the time. You'll see a similar pattern with news coverage from all the Godi media agencies. Guess what... He'll be the PM once again He has more tweets in 10 days than I have since I made my account in 2009. [removed] Attention to Detail 👏  You are still expecting him to say something sensible? dude, few months ago i was at your place, constructively criticising govt for good. these sheeps will lick their master's foot for hindu rashtra. (hindu here) you live in authoritarian country bro, hope you adapt yourselves He is making all right moves to get nobel prize this year and project himself as biggest messiah for the world. At least Hindus aren't in khatra anymore, oh wait Even such an emergency is an opportunity for PR. Waah Modi Ji waah Tomo again the herd will follow.. Waah Modiji Waah!! Reality check ding dong! I'm not surprised but good effort for the scanning of these terms. No talk about mangoes? What was expected from the butcher of  Gujarat 2002? If we ever make an Indian version of 'The Greatest Showman' we've got our hero already I really want to know what people of /r/IndiaSpeak or as called bhakts have to say about this. This is enough to get the bhakts to orgasm. like the image series the other day described, mentioning PPE or welfare schemes even once will make him accountable to questions on them, so he doesn’t mention it. simple. The conman's flute tunes have made the zombies blind. There's no common sense anymore. Ahh yes. 
Here we can see Number of tweets= How much one cares about that issue, because tweeting about something always solves the problem. Always.... Here's a genuine question. 

Many people have been bashing Modi for not diving  into details about deaths, ventilators, ICUs, PPEs etc but the health ministry does a detailed press conference regarding all that every single day. 

I know, Modi is trying to milk this issue for creating this sense of collective struggle and even I don't see a point of the theatrics he makes us do. 

But don't you think it's unreasonable to blame him for something he is already taking care of through someone else? what can u expect, his followers are crazy. Just yesterday, I saw a guy was justifying gujrat danga. He has won a democratic election. Majority of our fellow citizens chose him as our leader and we deserve whatever comes next. Atleast when we go bankrupt, we'll be doing it together as a nation. No left right or center politics will come to our aid.🙏 Everyone here shitting here in comment section why don't you go and check his twitter timeline. Every other tweet is about COVID-19.

Don't forgot he regularly talks with stakeholder like CMs, MPs. (Publicly). There will be private talks with officials as well.[https://twitter.com/narendramodi/status/1248993124489330691?s=20](https://twitter.com/narendramodi/status/1248993124489330691?s=20)

>Had yet another fruitful interaction with all Chief Ministers, the third such one in the last few days. We continued the extensive deliberations relating to the COVID-19 situation in India.

Also, his role is to keep public positive about future in this time. Otherwise, public will go crazy. We all know what kind of fellow Indians we have. Even a small % is too big.

[https://twitter.com/narendramodi](https://twitter.com/narendramodi)

And finally more importantly, most probably tweet is not composed by himself, it's just approval. This is how much his fanbase cares about these issues getting more importance.

517,Politics,"Today, Congress has been greatly weakened or become politically irrelevant in 143 Lok sabha due to breakaway regional Congress parties led by former regional leaders",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fge15y/today_congress_has_been_greatly_weakened_or/,"* West Bengal : 42 seats, breakaway party = All India Trinamool Congress

* United Andhra pradesh : 42 seats, breakaway party = YSR Congress

* maharashtra : 48 seats, breakaway party = National Congress party

* Chattisgarh : 11 seats, breakaway party = janta Congress Chattisgarh

In all these 143 seats, Congress was earlier a strong player. In fact, a strong performance in Andra pradesh in 2004 by Congress was the reason vajpayee lost power in 2004.

Congress needs to become more democratic where aspirations of regional leaders are allowed to flourish.

Not mentioned here, Himanta Biswa Sarma who left Congress in frustration due to lack of decision making and joined bjp. He is the primary reason behind BJP's rise to power in North East . Congress handling of him was a massive self goal

https://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-still-remember-you-feeding-your-dog-instead-of-listening-to-problems-of-assam-himanta-biswa-sarma-slams-rahul-gandhi-2556201"," At this point, it just seems like a fraction of Congress members are actually helping BJP behind the scene. And why should we care?

Congress is responsible for its own downfall and we don't owe them anything. 

As far as defeating BJP is concerned, congress is the biggest roadblock. Whenever congress is the biggest opposition in a state, BJP ends up winning easy or forms govt afterwards anyways. Mamata is holding her fort in WB, Kejriwal maintained his status in Delhi and Sharad Pawar halted BJP in Maharashtra. The country will be much better without the carcass of congress. Congress has tried to decimate local leadership since Rajiv Gandhi time . Remember when He humiliated sitting Andra CM in an Airport which led to congress losing to NT Rama Rao in 1982.

And since then this has always been a time honoured tradition of Gandhi family clear out any regional leader who may challenge their in future. 

They never showed any respect any regional leaders and only ones mattered were if you in their inner circle.Afterall this is their property so who can complain. Congress have themselves to blame. In regards to the Telugu states; few policy decisions were being made at the central level and many politicians used the word ‘high command’. The word high command even permeated into pop culture where it was parodied and used in movies, and people used to joke about it. 

After YSR’s death, the word high command became commonplace. It was embarrassing. People hated being controlled by a person sitting 1500kms away. They became spineless. All that Congress wants at the moment is for things go to so so bad that people just end up voting for Congress and Rahul Gandhi can be the PM. 

Their insistence on not having a non-Gandhi PM candidate is crushing. They are proving everyone right in calling them a dynastic political party. Congress doesn't have anyone but itself to blame.

They actively refrained from campaigning in West Bengal and Odisha in 2019, and allied with wrong parties. For all practical purposes Congress is a relic of the past. 

Muslims used to vote for Congress. Now they have nowhere to go. They must organize their own Hindostan Party which would include every one except the Hindutva adherents. And they must do it fast."

Jai Hind! > The arrest of a Muslim dairy farmer in West Bengal’s Hooghly district for selling cow urine and dung as an antidote to COVID-19 has sparked a political row, with the State BJP president Dilip Ghosh questioning the police’s justification in apprehending the man.
Police on Tuesday arrested Mamud Ali, alias Sheikh Mamud, in Hooghly district’s Dankuni, about 25 km from Kolkata, for attempting to “outrage religious feelings” and booked him under Sections 295A and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code. Well,  the  guy  definitely  deserves  arrest,  like  anyone  selling  quack  cures  at  a  time  of  pandemic. But  what  part  of  it  outrages  religious  feelings?

519,Politics,It seems all is not well between Modi and Shah.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fyxft4/it_seems_all_is_not_well_between_modi_and_shah/,"Since the start of lockdown, we can observe Amit shah is totally out of the loop. As per the procedure,now home ministry is one of the most important in current condition , but Amit shah who can confidently take press conferences unlike his guru is seen nowhere.

Was having a chat with a old friend who is a gujrat based journalist, he was saying that Modi dreams have got bigger and he is now aiming to become somewhat of a global icon and dreaming of a nobel prize like Obama , the reason we see him buttering international leaders like Trump and Jinping.Modi is also video conferencing other chief ministers and taking stock of this pandemic albeit in a very democratic manner.

Few months back, he has instructed party top brass to keep Hindu-Muslim politics aside as he will go for a image rebuilding in the coming years.
But Shah is Shah, his entire political career is based on communal politics, and he is quite dope on that and cannot survive if he doesn't do his regular drama. 

We can see the notorius UP police filing FIRs on news channels on false reporting of Tabliki jamaat attendees , it was an outcome of Modi giving a stern warning to party top brass to not give a communal twist to corona pandemic. 

Congress has a godfather culture ,where party leaders usually don't topple their godfather.
But BJP is quite opposite where there is a culture of outsmarting their gurus., be it Modi-advani, Gadkari-fadnavis, Shivraj-Vijayvargiya., Maybe Amit shah was also planning the same and was getting bigger for his shoes, hence his wings are getting clipped ."," I find two points not fitting well. 

>the reason we see him buttering international leaders like Trump and Jinping.

Lol, US and China didnt have anything to do with Nobel prize.  Trump couldnt win himself and China imprisoned a winner for exposing CCP.

>Modi is also video conferencing other chief ministers and taking stock of this pandemic albeit in a very democratic manner.

Health is a state subject . Center can announce lockdown but workers on the  ground  belongs to States.  Center has zero control over them unless they declare emergency.   As the resources and controls are shared , . Ie railways , fci, airways , interstate road transportation , health workers, police . They all need to work together. So , there has to be coordination meetings. 


Well rest is  your  observation . You are free to express. Well could be..but modi is a very good actor Been hearing this theory on alot of independent news sources since the past week, however, you can never trust reptilians. LOL.   
As someone who has been living in Guj for 30 years, This is a baseless theory. He's fat and has diabetes probably he has to stay hidden Great story! >Few months back, he has instructed party top brass to keep Hindu-Muslim politics aside as he will go for a image rebuilding in the coming years.

Few months back we were seeing a united India protesting against CAA, which was reduced down to a hindu muslim issue in the name of Shaheen Bagh.

This could be fanfic for all we know. The rule of two, the apprentice will become the new master. The force is strong in the dark side now. It's time to embrace the dark side. Shah will be the new emperor I was talking to someone who is close to the Thackerays' a few months ago and this is what he told me. Before the Maharashtra elections, there was a clear verbal agreement between the SS and the BJP that power would be shared, and SS would choose its own representative to be the CM for the first 2.5 years. This was hammered out between Amit Shah and UT. However, Fadnavis was not part of this discussion. Fadnavis was known as a Narendra Modi acolyte who often bypassed Amit Shah. His slogan internally during the elections was ""Dilli mein Narendra, yahan pe Devendra"". After the elections, he was triumphantly setting himself up for a second term, when the SS pulled the rug under him, reminding the BJP of the agreement with Amit Shah. Then all hell broke loose, and that is how we have a SS-NCP-Congress Government in Maharashtra. Amit Shah sat back and watched as Fadnavis's wing's were clipped. Reported for bullshit This sounds absolute nonsense to me. Coz communal politics is going as strong as ever. And why is it only UP police, why not other bjp states too? [deleted] :D you do paint the BJP as Siths man. There are always two I didn't see a cow in this table. Where is the cow? Seems plausible. Every megalomaniac thinks his subordinates are replaceable. Trump will not doubt will this coming election that too without any second in command of Shah stature. To Modi, Trump's MO of power wielding probably seems like heaven - surround yourself with nincompoops and do whatever you want because the public loves you. Yes, it makes total sense.

Probably why there's so much conflict between Shah and Doval. Both are doers. But one is a no name government employee and the other is a well known and dangerous goon. Modi prefers people that do not have any personal political standing.

But I dont quite believe it. Not just yet. Modi will still run to Shah come UP elections. Tf is this blinds and gossip bullshit Amit Shah was there in cabinet meetings. Saw at-least 3-4 photos of different meetings. He's probably taking a break from being at forefront. Perhaps Shah took responsibility for Delhi wipeout and retreated into the shadows /s I hope, maybe even after a lot of years later, we get to watch a movie/read a book with the actual dirt that went on inside BJPs office during these years. Who do you guys think would write that book? provide the source please. I think it's not his ""thing"". Shah will surface again when the time come. But don't think modi is different than shah. Don't look at what someone says look at what they does. Remember kapdo se he pahchan me aa jata hai? Before saying stop communalizig corona they let full 10-15 days communal poison spread. Their purpose is fulfilled. Now they are just waiting this this to end and than they'll start doing it again. Remember ayodya verdict? Every was told sab court ka nirday manenge and they had already bought the judges meanwhile. These are some real samples of pure evil people working together. They aren't going to change their politics overnight. They have been doing this all their life. This is all they know. The probability of this happening is very less. Modi and Shah know that both can't function without each other. Why would Modi say that irrespective of everything. Their entire politics is based on the communal division and fooling people. Advani ka sath thik na hua xD This is all rubbish. Either Shah is corona positive or he is busy planning Rajsthan MP buyout. All weak kings get paranoid of their loyalists.
All ambitious vassals play loyal till they get to overthrow their liege. In the wise words of r/cricket, RIFT™ confirmed This is simply another tactic by Hindutva.

Every Hindutva leader is a supremacist. They don't go back to being secular. To do so, they would have to admit to themselves and the public that their notions of supremacy which justified all their evil actions till date, were wrong.

What could be happening is what has happened in the past: delegitimize one figurehead to legitimize the other.

Happened with Vajpayee and Advani. Happening with Modi and Shah. Will happen in the future as well."
520,Politics,"RSS says Tablighi Jamaat conduct not reflection on all Muslims, they’re aiding govt in fight",https://theprint.in/india/rss-says-tablighi-jamaat-conduct-not-reflection-on-all-muslims-theyre-aiding-govt-in-fight/396166/,," We're in the endgame now Did Covid-19 also opened a portal to alternate dimension? I welcome this mature decision taken by RSS. This is normal expected behaviour but given their past, we must be appreciative of this cooperative stance taken by them Wait, what? [removed] This is a RSS classic. The footmen on the ground, the Godi Media, everyone unnamed will run narrative after narrative demonizing a target.

RSS head comes out and puts out a statement saying the most rational left leaning statement.

*world: pikachu_surprised.jpg*

Narrative goes one like nothing happened. RSS needs Tablighi , Tabligi needs RSS, both are theological based tribalism and each feed the other feeding suspicion and fear slowly poisoning society and creating theological base for them to feed on.

Fuck them both. Well said, RSS, credit where credit's due. They said these things too

Baad mai chhupe rehna, chhupana, jo jaanch kaarane ke liye aa rahein hai unki sewa ke liye unse behooda vyvahar karna, ye toh kuch vikruti ka hee darshan hai (to hide afterwards, to misbehave with those examining them, reflects some form of perverseness),” he said. 

“The way they are spitting is against the parampara (tradition) of India. Agar galti se kisi ko paer lagta hai toh hum namaskar karte hai (even if our feet accidentally touches someone, we apologise),” he added, stating, however, that the Tablighi members’ conduct was not a reflection on the entire community.

This is incorrect. They were as stranded as anyone after the lockdown because they went to masjids to preach and didn't have accomodations. Some were scared of coming out as from the community to be tested because of the backlash from everywhere. 

Even a lot of them were wrongly accused of misbehavior which was exaggerated where true and made up in other cases just because the media jumped on the hate bandwagon.
Luckily many police Twitter accounts clarified and made fake news media delete their claims.

Unfortunately all this made it further difficult to track and isolate them quickly enough to avoid spread to others. 

All that was needed was simple cooperation which would've made everything easier. Of course the non cooperation by few could be punished. But by singularly making claims that ALL of jamaat members are non cooperative etc..they just scared the shit out of them.

Don't people run away from quarantine?
Is it always because they're bad?
I think even thousands jamaat members suffered because of behavior of hardly few. This might be just lip service service though. [deleted] All hail the Nazis for taking a 5 minute break from doing Nazi things and saying something resembling basic humanity. And of course, all sins are forgiven. Water under the fucking bridge. 

Some here are praising the RSS for this. Yes. The RSS. The Nazi-inspired Hindutva fascist organization that elects terrorists to power, controls all of India, is responsible for at least half of the country's miseries in the last few decades and which has now singlehandedly plunged the country into utter, seemingly inescapable darkness. *That* RSS is now worthy of 'admiration' in light of this statement. And it's not sarcasm. They mean it. 

THAT is how dangerously sentimental, shallow and schizophrenic this country is.

A hard-on for Nazis is just an 'uplifting' news report away. [removed] Good cop Bad cop. And let's not equate the two, one is a global group of Islamic purists (I would say similar to ISKON), while the other is an armed militia born out of Nazi inspiration whose ideology is rooted in jingoism, fascism, and Hindu-supremacy. Nice statement. Needs to be backed by action where Muslims are treated as equal citizens with full dignity and not be questioned about their loyalty every single time the nation is in crisis. What universe have I got teleported into?? My reaction after reading this....""Hain"". 🧐 I rubbed my eyes twice to see if this was real. [removed] Confused boner... What is this, the Upside Down? WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING BOYS? nah, psychological trick, playing cool letting social media do the work.

Now people will say ""RSS is so good but they still say bad things about them, \*cry \*sad, apan vote tho Modi ko hi"" I had to slap myself and read it again couple of times just to be sure I wasn't imagining things. First Arnab praising kerala government and now this. What is happening ya'll? PR.. Now they dont care.. infiltration has reached its summit. Our fascists are not like their fascists. Our fascists are kind. This is their standard strategy to rewrite history. If ever they are out of power and fingers pointed at them for promoting violence at Muslims they will happily reprint these statements similar to how they now say RSS don’t have hand in Gandhi murder and goes on to celebrate Gandhi. In 20-30 years I won’t be surprised if Gandhi named as a Sarsangchalak or whatever shit they call themselves. Bah gawd RSS with the face turn *uno reverse card*"

Lesser involvement of government in the personal choices and lives  of people. Corona I think it's become fashionable to beat congress, esp. the Gandhis for everything that happens. While I too feel that many of their actions are unexplainable but perhaps there is something that we are missing. Surely they can't be that dumb that they cannot see what the entire social media experts are seeing. In this case, if their choice was picking a side between folks that won them the state vs a person who couldn't even win his own seat, would it be wrong if they picked the former?

The irony is that I’ll flair this post as “Politics”."," Good for you if you can actually stay indifferent but I'm almost certain it will eventually find its way back if you remain sane. It's toxic and everytime I read about politicians spewing bullshit, police complicity in violence, someone treated unjustly for looking different or has certain kind of name, or of citizens arrested for speaking up against the government, it makes my blood boil. I know I'm helpless and and that my rantings are futile but I can't force myself to not care. It seems I've internalised the issues and thus let the problems outside and beyond me hurt me more than they should. With PM Shah, PM Bisht and PM Surya just rearing to lead our society to newer and newer heights of idiocy over the next half century, it's gonna be the longest bloodiest comedy series ever in the history of mankind.

But on a +ve note, few expected 5-6 months ago to see so many students protesting, chanting preamble, and irritating the beardos no end. Fewer still expected foreign govts to criticize the govt so scathingly. For now, nothing stops each of us from trying to find ways to help potential victims. So, it is a dark comedy series but with unexpected flashes of optimism once in a while. Ah I see you're a man/woman of culture as well. We have to understand India has Multi-Party Political System with 1.4 Billion People. The Biggest Democracy on Earth. Unlike USA which has only two Political parties with two ideologies. In China there is only One Communist Party with No Election at all. There are at least 50 major regional Political Parties in India. All Parties have different Ideologies like Communism, Socialism, Nationalism, etc. Hence there is lot of noise in India. People don't know what to follow. Every Party wants to win election.

I'm talking about 2014 LS elections. I used to share memes and all online, they saw it but the difference of opinion never affected our friendship. But last month since Jamia incident, it reached my saturation point and I'm just posting against the govt and all without any self censorship or considering about their feelings, posting photos and videos from protests I'm participating in and they've started losing their shit. I've lost so many friendships since then. I didn't care and have no regrets until recently, a really good friend of mine,a school friend, uploads demonstration he's participated in support of CAA. I would've blocked if it were any other person but I gave him benifit of doubt. Talked to him. We were having a productive discussion until the point he started justifying the actions taken by UP police and Delhi Police. UP police raiding homes was ""teaching them a lesson"" and ""maintain law and order"". I got so rattled with such a response. He never was like this. We have such wonderful school memories together. He's never been this venomous. I'm in a dilemma and don't know what to do next."," I have. I've ditched almost all my friends from school-time. To be honest, current political issues are much more than regular 'politics'. In this political climate, some people are showing disturbing shades of personalities. It is much more than just a difference in political opinions. It is about humanity. If a person shows something negative in this regard, try to fix it. If cannot be done...sayonara. [deleted] Circumstances like these are when people show their true colors. Use this as an opportunity to weed out shitty people from your life. Good riddance. Aisa kachra life mein na ho to behtar hai. Deleted a close friend from my friend list because of the constant propaganda he was sharing on my timeline. So much hatred for Muslims even though he himself was in a relationship with a Muslim girl I lost 3 friends, one being my throughout school friend. I think I still have no regrets standing for what’s correct :) This is the biggest crime that Modi & Shah are guilty of: destroying the social fabric of the country through the use of classic propaganda and brainwashing techniques, but using social media. No other politician has achieved this on such a scale.

The only people who escaped the spell of these two rogues are a small minority who are naturally sceptical about everything. Looks like your friend didn't escape the spell.

It is no coincidence that the growing opposition to ShahModi now is coming from young people, who have a better understanding of how media manipulation works and who possess a natural scepticism about things that their parents' generation blindly believes in. I haven't lost friends but I'm seriously reconsidering breaking up some friendships. A lot of people aren't really having a lot in their lives to talk about and it's easy to talk about politics. 
I have always been a centrist in my political views and it seems as few want me to join their ""team"". It's a dirty game, but you don't have to play it. I can be your friend OP :) Sad, but I went through this just the other day. I knew he was a bhakt, but not such a violent one with such low regard for human life. Long story short, it wasn't even a discussion, he outright started abusing me because I shared a post on my feed about keeping personal information safe, etc. Minutes later, a friendship of 13 odd years just disappeared. It's better to cut these kinds of people out, the sooner the better. They: don't lose friendship over politics, yaar


Me: Can't lose friendship over humanity, yaar. Goodbye. Why do you want to be friends with such a bigot? Welcome to my world buddy. You are in the same boat as I. My best friend has turned into a soft bhakt and justifies every action of the govt one way or the other. He is one of the kindest man I know and about 80% of his friends are Muslims and yet the cognitive dissonance persists. The only difference between our situations is we do not post memes and articles in our common group. We both know where the other stands politically and I call out on his bullshit if he open his mouth regarding the CAA or NRC debacle but we keep it respectful.

We don't name call each other. We have a mature conversation and usually never come to an agreement. The only thing I ever said that was harsh was that hope he doesn't stand on the pavement while his muslim friends are being hauled into an uncertainty and shouting that they should get into the vans because the govt said so. He kept quiet and never spoke about the CAA issue with me ever again. We meet now and talk about life in general. Keep politics minimal. There is a tacit understanding that we value the friendship more than our political differences. I remember a quote from a game which aptly describes your dilemma , it goes like this '' Friends, who want to remain friends, don't discuss religion or politics''.

But, we need to draw a line somewhere, if your friend starts justifying premeditated  violence on innocent citizens, then it's time to start evaluating your friendship. Kanhaiya Kumar actually raised this point in his recent speech at JNU. Modi is dividing families and friends. *First they ignore you, then they laugh at you,* ***then they fight you***, *then you win* Distance yourself from these venomous snakes. Indian people don't know about the term ""opinion"". They are stupid and have a mentality of if your opinion is not same as mine, fuck you! I was just saying today how this moment in time has brought out the true colours of so many people we know. On one hand it's shocking to see the hate and utter stupidity but on the other it's heartening to see the good. 

You need to decide whether you're okay being friends with these people. They aren't just people who have a difference in political opinions. They're straight up hate-mongering, blood-thirsty, bigoted pieces of filth. Recently I have lost my good friend too. He doesn't used to be like that, but he is acting differently. He started saying that most of the muslim doesn't know what actually CAA and started the crap. Then he said after explaining these thing to muslim dominated  community in bangalore everyone changed their mind and they are in support of CAA. A convenient story to dismiss ones view, I am sure he is using the WhatsApp forward messages. Then I argued with him that CAA itself is unconstitutional as you are discriminating on the basis of religion. Then he started saying this is very emotional matter to him, started crying about Hindus in other country. I said u could take the persecuted in your country regardless of religion or country. Then he said we cant take everyone as we have enough population so discarding few of them. I had enough explaining him about this but he is not listening and asking me to change my mind. If this is the case then they weren't WORTHY friends to begin with

I assume liberal Germans lost a lot of friends to Nazi politics

U know they stayed silent and what happened then?

SS killed all Liberal activists. U r speaking up and not submitting to authority that's why Modi is silent else he wud have impose 144 everywhere. Jab tum mehgayi berozgari or Mandi ki baat karoge to main tumhe Hindu muslim me uljha dunga

ache din aagaye Mitrooooooooooooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnnnn >they saw it but the difference of opinion never affected our friendship.

that's because you're a privileged ""moderate"" who prefers negative peace to positive justice. politics always affects people you were just privileged enough to not care. See if he your true and old  friend, then you should not care about his political views at all, like seriosuly just don't discuss politics with everyone or scrutinize everyone's social media post. It is not worth it family and friends are made not of similarity of political views but on relations and experiences. .


Please don't consider doing a weeding out or something like that of friends over political views or stuff, it would just leave you friendless in an echo chamber of ""new friends"" with only common thing being politics. There is much more to life than modi or politics, just discuss that...there is like a 1000 issues to discuss which you guys might see exactly same, why fight over one thing you guys differ ????? People who support murderers and criminals are accomplices

I don't want to be friends with criminal accomplices Welcome to the boat! I am also trying to reason out with friends as much as I can. 

One question I got asked is ""Look at the situation of West Bengal, these immigrants are creating violence and chant anti national slogans. Why should we tolerate them?""  


I am not too aware of the realities in West Bengal though. Is it that only immigrant Muslims cause trouble there? Can someone please enlighten me about the above point. I feel like Social Media has a huge part in this. 10 years ago, no one would talk about politics in person with the kind of intensity we use on social media. How old are you? 


I had to cut off ties and leave my the WhatsApp groups for the same reason during the first week of strikes. It was appalling to see people who I have known for years to defend the violence/BJP. 

I’m at an age where I don’t want myself to be surrounded by enablers. Everything was “changa si” with labels and stuff but if one comes around and defends/justifies the kind of violence which happened on 15/12 and 05/01, then piss off, mate. This happens when we grow balls to talk about something we are invested or excited in. But honestly, given your description, it's just a difference of opinions. Maybe go to their place, spend time with them, but don't bring up this topic. Remember JNU came now, these are your old friends. Are you really open for discussion? No, because when you post something ""without censorship"" others should be OK but when someone else has contrary view to you start with a judgement (you mention you gave him benefit of doubt) that they are somehow wrong or misguided and you are not. Then you mention you talk to them (rather convince them to switch sides) and when they too present their uncensored opinion, you get rattled.

Is it not hypocritical? [removed]"

As it turns out, there is United Nations genocide convention that defines the term, and what happened to the Sikhs, while likely a crime against humanity, does not meet that definition, says Frank Chalk, a Concordia University history professor and past president of the International Association of Genocide Scholars.
While the  victims were clearly targeted because of their religion, the killings were not part of a “long-term, sustained and systematic” effort, perpetrated by government, to wipe out the Sikhs, which is how genocide is described in the UN convention, he said. No one cares about Jagmeet In Canada. He is a Sikh version of Rahul Gandhi"

It is obviously nothing more than a thought experiment.

But Prakash Javadekar's statement about BJP losing Delhi because of Congress's failure made me think about it. May it is true that BJP will not be able to survive without the Congress as its opponent. They've been unable to fight any regional party on home turf quite consistently. If we had more regional parties would it be so difficult to imagine an India without BJP or Congress? 

How would national coalitions be made? North vs South? Hindi vs non Hindi? I have no idea. But the possibility excites me. What do you think? 


Taking a side step, splitting Andhra resulted in Congress losing the state and two regional parties talking over. Maybe splitting the larger states could accelerate this process? Spitting MP said did not have the same effect, so I know it is not a reliable way to do it. Just thinking out loud here."," I believe this is how it should work. People must vote for the party who they believe will work best in their constituency, not for the party who they want to see in power at the Centre. So many things would change.

Right on the money, Hindi-Belt needs to be thoroughly fragmented into equivalent political units to  kill the Hindutva Majoritarian sentiments and also to promote more competitive federalism.

531,Politics,My fears about how the current political situation would affect the Republic Day celebrations turned out to be true.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eu36ic/my_fears_about_how_the_current_political/,"I've been attending the flag hoisting at our colony's association building for years now. Our colony has always been a lot diverse in terms of religion. Everything was normal after the flag hoisting ceremony, members of the association gave speeches about our constitutional rights, fundamental rights and duties as well as secularism but it soon went downhill from that.

Another man from the colony started his speech about how our constitution and laws need amendments time after time and we should support them, and then he yelled that no matter what we believe we are must respect the national flag and national anthem and those who didn't do that or didn't return the cheer of ""Bharat Mata Ki Jai"" are of no use to this colony or nation. An odd 4-5 people clapped at his statement after which he proceeded to yell ""Bharat Mata ki Jai"" and specifically pointed out this Old Muslim Man who wore a skull cap and came with his grandchildren of about 6-7 years of age that he wasn't cheering the same and he shouldn't stay here. When the old man started to leave, all the 10-12 association members and the president consoled him to stay while he was pulling away, his grandchildren started crying and the 20-25 odd schoolchildren who were there looked perplexed.

The old man decided to stay albeit being a lot sadder and angrier, yelling that he's been here longer than he has and is more patriotic than he ever will be. This incident was followed by the Association President's message that ""No person was supposed to force his beliefs and practices. Everyone has the right to cheer or not cheer for whatever they want"". He proceeded to apologise to the man for the speaker's words and invited him specifically to the function after this. The members of the association then proceeded to apologise and console him. 

Meanwhile, the man who gave the statement was being confronted by a single person for his words and was also being supported by one other man. He shook his hand and praised him for his words.

Ironically, the man who supported his words had stuck his paper flag on his heart turned upside down. 

This incident had me fuming but I calmed down after reminding myself that it was one guy (and the 4-5 odd people who clapped for him) against the 10-12 members and elders of the association who consoled the old man.

[Image from the incident](http://imgur.com/a/a4JA2Qb)

The man in the blue shirt and the red circle was the one who gave the speech, the man in the brown shirt and the blue circle was the man who supported him. The other man in white confronted him and counselled him for his words. I could add a voice record that I recorded out of fear and anticipation that something of this sort would happen.

TL;DR : Muslim man was told to leave the flag hoisting event by a person for not cheering ""Bharat Mata Ki Jai"" infront of  association members and children from the colony. Association apologizes and condemns his words."," What a shit-show. Hope the grandchildren remember the other members of the society who stood for their grandfather and not the bokachoda who thought it was appropriate to single out people and display his bigotry. Fucking morons everywhere. Fascist uncles always existed, the only difference now is that they're no longer afraid to speak or even feel obliged to make their racists views known in the name of ""nationalism"". As sad as this sounds, the beautiful thing is that people stood up for the Muslim man. In many cases that would not have happened. The current protests are clear evidence of the pushback and I'm glad it's finally happening. Hopefully it gets better. The muslim answer to such behavior is usually to settle in ""muslim areas"". hindus who can't stand non vegetarian muslims also create their own colonies.

Mist of mumbai is like this. Ghettoism starts this way. Hardly places where multi communities stay.Then theres a lot you'll hear from hindu communities about muslims and vice versa usually bad things and children believe them since they have never lived together with each other.

They'll probably go to different schools and meet each other during college but by that time be so stuck to their ideology that they'll completely ignore each other or be part of a radical group against each others communities.

Each group will have offenses by members of the other group to demean each other I don't know why some people associate chanting ""bharat mata ki jai"" with patriotism. Muslims never refused to sing National Anthem and ""Jai Hind"" and patriotism is not something which we can summed into a single slogan.Muslims do not chant ""bharat mata ki jai "" because it is conflicting with their religion they considered Allah the greatest of all ,that is why a muslim chanting "" bharat mata ki jai"" conflicting the greatness of their Allah.

It is the same way Hindus can not say ""Allahu Akbar(Allah is the Greatest)"" because saying it would be   putting Allah above other Hindus deities.
There are alot of miss understanding in our country regarding Muslims and Madarsas and Islam .Sacchar committee broke those myths but sadly government never took the report seriously.

India Is a Secular country ,and it was Secular before the 42nd amendment in which secular word added in the preamble.

Secularism is one the basic feature of the Constitution and Secularism can not be scrapped unless you scrap the Constitution. You should do a stand up at these things Same. My family decided not to go for this exact reason. Instead we went to family brunch. 

Drama isn't really worth it.

All minority members individually decided to go to separate family events. This brings back memories of my own colony. Good memories. We had people from all over India peacefully living side by side. That's why we can't give up idea of secular India. Rather than chanting bharat mata ki jai people should keep the country clean and become better people. When he originally yelled ""Bharat mata ki Jai"" everyone should have shouted ""Jai Bhim"". Why people organise Republic Day/Independence day , in colonies where illiterates live ? Sad. By the way what is the reason for Muslims to not say Bharat mata ki jai? This is just one of the many examples of how society has sadly been divided on religion. Nobody is saying that there were no issues before, but the way they have multiplied through fake, biased news and WhatsApp is sad. Society is being polarized and people are being brainwashed"

Bigots atleast are self-empowered in their expression of hateful ideologies and most start by wanting to fit in with their families.

If those who disagree dont grow some spine to oppose loved ones,youre not really going to make a dent in those you dont love. Youll just do what youve been taught to do by family members,at best. Run away."," We need to teach critical thinking and formulating proper arguments. And then begin asking questions to teachers and parents, who mostly don't like their authority to be questioned. Things follow from there. lol, gave me a chuckle. My uber-serious Indian girlfriend broke up with me because she couldn’t stand up to her Dad’s emotional brainwashing.
We were almost engaged 😅 Indian family structure is oppressive inherently. Schools, media, family, everything is geared at teaching a concept of respect that makes it difficult for Indians to counteract against families. Those who do are rubbished throughout the extended families as black sheep.

What needs to happen is a change in our system of education as well as the current generation being better parents to their children, enabling them an opportunity to be critical thinkers. Exactly! Though I believe that this had it's roots in our culture as well as the education system. From childhood itself, the idea of unquestioned adherence to our parents and teachers is instilled quite deeply, and the same people lose the ability to question any kind of authority and grow up to become obedient peons of the society. They have no idea that what is taught to them is not always the right thing, and that there's always a different perspective to look at things. As long as this doesn't change, no amount protests is going to make a difference. Also, Indians need to learn to stand up to those bully teachers in school.

Also, Indians need to learn to stand up to those bully managers in work places.

Also, Indians need to learn to stand up to those bully relatives in their families.

Also, Indians need to learn to stand up to those bully bigoted unkills spreading vitriol in whatsapp groups.

Also, Indians need to learn to stand up to the truth and accept it, and not be crying like a whining b*tch.

Also, Indians need to learn to call a piece of shit a piece of shit, a scumbag a scumbag, an arsonist an arsonist, a rapist a rapist and so on. I could not agree with you more. This is primarily one of the reasons why Indians are so docile and meek when it comes to defending their own ideas. It is primarily because since childhood, they are covered under the shroud of ""culture"" and ""riwaz"" and adults are these infallible and unerring beings who you should always listen to and never ever question their authority, even in a polite and civil fashion.  Not to mention that if you do veer off against the ideology of your parents, sometimes the consequences can be dire as you can be abused physically, mentally or be outright abandoned. 

This is the reason why we hesitate so much to speak out against corrupt politicians, abusive policemen or local netas; it is because the idea of blind respect is forcefully drilled into our brains from a very young age. Unlike western countries, we don't have child protection agencies who look out for the welfare of kids and parents can pretty much get away with anything they do to their children in the name of ""discipline"".

I wholeheartedly believe that if Indian parents did a proper job of raising kids, we'd have a better society overall which would question people in leadership, would be more confident and assertive, and would possess the ability to comprehend what is right and wrong on a larger level.  Unfortunately when you raise kids in the environment of fear, jealousy and hate, you have the contemporary India that we can all see. Dont give up guys. I have changed my parents outlook to somewhat extent. Hope you will also after trying. Indians do need to stand up to their parents whenever it is necessary, especially for life changing situations such as further education, marriage, life and so on. 
But, the problem is Indian kids are so fearful, that they hide even their basic relations with boyfriends/girlfriends for fear of being disowned. Indian kids depend on money from parents, at times upto even 25 years or even 30 years. Parents use these tools to control kids in their later life. 

Heck, in my family, my own sister who's a ""strong independent woman"" can't convince her boyfriend to elope because that dude is a complete mama's boy which makes me want to tell my sister to leave him because he's such a coward. The dude has a Master's degree and yet has never even heard of the Special Marriages Act. That's the society today, literate yet illiterate; educated yet fools; brazen yet cowards. My mother uses kundalis and religious teachings generously to keep us controlled, usually backfiring tremendously at the expense of the entire family. Almost always there is an unhealthy dose of arguments.

Why are there more than 2 lakh engineering students unemployed in India today? Why is there a lack of lawyers in India? Why is there a lack of legit thinkers in India? Why is dissent being shunned? All because elders are ""always right, and anyone below the age of 40 is a child, and children know nothing""! 

I believe in being rebellious all the time... This is to get answers to questions no one is ready to answer. Have a good day! :) A friend of mine told me how he stood up to his bigoted af uncle. When he started on his usual hate-filled rant about how Muslims are ruining this country, my friend started recording. The point was simple - if he has the conviction, and feel what he is saying is the truth, then he shouldn't be scared to air his views. Needless to say, he couldn't.


Edit : A word Ran away from my shit-hole of a home last year and moved to a brand new city thousands of kilometers down south. And I've never been back. Fuck Indian Parents and the toxic society that acts as an enabler to them.

Also, /r/AntiNatalism. We follow a feudal structure in India, along with strong patriarchy.

Even Hinduism is feudal in nature with its caste system.

Everything needs to broken to be remade.

*Sigh*
If only it were possible in our lifetime. Yeah when you don't rebel a bit, they never change. And a lot of people think they'll be disowned for the smallest of arguments. Remember they need you more than you need them after a few years.

I showed mine graphic videos of lynching and they finally disapproved what was happening. Agreed. Indian parents want the youth to emulate Bhagat Singh, only not their own spawn. saar, mummy khaana nahi pakayegi toh mar jaungaa Yesterday I had a heated argument with my dad, conservative, over the CAB and its protests. I can't believe an Engineer like him can be so illogical and blind to balance. Like, you're either supporting CAB because of emotional, irrational bias to BJP (Which is wtf, has the party sucked your cock off or what. Why the blind faith? Bhagwan thodi hai?) Or because of apathetic majoritarian mindset.

Either make me embarassed and disgusted at my father. Called him stupid and emotional for supporting the bill. F*ck this so called culture/traditions. Be free! be independent! But first move out of your parent's basement! the phrase ""mai baap sarkaar"" exists for a reason. Instead of the government serving the people, the default assumption in India seems to be that the government is doing you a favor  by ruling and telling you what to do (witness demonetization, upcoming NRC etc). Bhai this is so true... Yesterday I was out shopping with my mom and the shop had a TV telecasting this... The keeper and my mom started slurring about them, ""aur karo protest"" and smirking. I felt so guilty. I did that today. My father understood. But jokingly called me a communist. I did, multiple times. Got beaten up too, multiple times. What a shot, what a shot! Totally agree. Hahaha truer words have never been spoken... Most of my friends are still shocked by how chill my parents are and always when i give advice of talking to parents for their opinion i often get ridiculed about it. 

Folks are just afraid of their parents even after being 25 plus. Haha

\*cries in cowardice and dependence on them\* Bhai kya bola hai.. tere muh me ghee shakkar. I agree with most of what you say but here is the thing. Its not your parents faults. Simple as that. If we think we are better than them in terms of our 'forward' and 'open minded' thinking then we also need to realize that our parents were born and brought up in a completely different era. We have no idea what they have been through. Those times were rotten with fear and depression.

Take for example my grandparents who lived during the fearful war days around 1940's and almost escaped a burning train during the India Pakistan division. My mom and her family lived in fear and oppression her entire life. She wanted to get herself educated from an English medium school but my grand parents could not afford her education. These were the days. Truly dark times.

Disagree as much as you want with your loved ones. Try to change their thinking but don't force your opinions on anyone for that matter. Try to put yourself in their shoes and just try to understand the world that they have come from

We are moving in a forward direction. The only direction in future is forward. If you don't believe that then you need to open your mind and see where we have come in the last 20 years with the rise of internet and just being able to openly voice our opinions on public forums and social media.

We will change. We will get better. Its going to take time. Probably another 100 years or more but we will get there. Just relax and do your best without hating or offending your loved ones by realizing that they didn't have the same privilege as we do today. They didn't get the opportunities to shine like we have today. So instead of trying to fight them, work with them and try to instill positivity in whatever you do in life. This world is not perfect. No human is perfect and nothing in this world will ever be perfect. Learn to appreciate what you have

Peace and love Maybe it's because I was born in the States, but I leaned in college to just tell me parents what they wanted to hear and then do whatever I wanted anyway. It did not work right away, and led to many fights, but eventually they realized it was my life and I needed to be in control of that. I still solicited them for advice and help, but the final decision is always mine. I don't think it really worked until a decade later when I proved I could make good money without having to be a doctor though. Since then I've advised Indian friends to do the same, but it's had mixed results. I guess it depends on your situation. I agree that it is important to stand up to your family for the things that you believe in. But I don't think any reason why we can't do the both at the same time. Changing people's attitudes is a process and it takes time, especially when you're dealing with your parents. Most of the time they dismiss you as being childish and suffering from the 'idealism of the youth,' and they can do that because they're your parents. 

But I do agree with you, we have to start the process at our home and extend it to wider society. Man, all these stories are making me so grateful for my parents. I'm gonna go now and hug my mom. [deleted] Sorry guys, but misinformed people are a greater threat to this country than any bad politician(Tadipaar and/or Jumlebaaz) Wow that hit right in the sanskar Reminds me of the Russell peters sketch, you have 15 minutes to call the police...tbh your problem is not a problem just in India, it's in other countries If you don't stand for anything you will fall for anything Sometimes standing up to the government is way easier than standing up to parents. It’s natural. Our parents have raised us, and our future is intertwined with them. Very often we are financially dependent on them till we are adults. The level of emotional blackmail possible is very high. Unless we are willing to be cut out of wills and ruin the relationships our children will have with our parents, standing up to parents will always be more difficult than protesting on the street. I would argue the former often needs more courage. Summed up exactlymy feelings..!Change starts from your home. This is so true. I am glad to know many people are thinking about this. hope is kinda lost for this generation's parents, hopefully it would be better from the Millenials onwards. Respect elders and respect teachers mentality needs to go, if I ever have childrens, I will teach them respect only the one's they deem it worthy of it Gold worthy Be financially independent then you can take your own decisions. First young Indians need to smash that bigoted uncle who keeps coming around your house spewing nonsense about poor people and other religious minorities. I’m sure you guys know who I’m talking about. Yaar, I've been standing up to my parents for years now. Pehle it was still better, they did listen. But modia has taken the better of them. It's so much worse now, they speak the modia speak, any evidence, any counter and any argument is fake news to them. It ends up in serious yelling matches no matter how we start it. Earlier there was doubt and suppressed belief that Muslims are bad, now it's a loud and proud truth for them that they want to oppress minorities. Talking politics has become a pain and a constant frustration in the family. My understanding is that Indian boomers lack any empathy, are submissive to the system, fear backlash and have only succumbed to capitalist consumerist materialistic lifestyles. Good luck with that. I gave up trying to reason with my mother. Being the only atheist in a family is difficult. My mother trying to convince me and me trying to convince her. It's a dead end. Not gonna work. I stood up to my parents when I was in my teenage years and they have given me space every since which has made me more confident. 

I was also very anti-establishment when I was younger but it has been clear for some time that both sides are shit including the JNU students, BJP, RSS, Congress and even those protesters in Assam. 

This subreddit is a great example of people not doing much research and going with anything anti-establishment. 

Twitter/Whatsapp is a great example of people not doing any research and going with anything supporting BJP/RSS.

It was much easier to fight British because you at least had a clear enemy. You don't even have that now . [removed]"

Explanation in comments.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g0g58p/offbeat_hindi_eli5_about_inclusion_as_the_worst/,"When people talk about inclusion, there is a strongly held assumption of a *Centre* where margins are/can be ""included"" and we have seen time and again that inclusions creates more exclusions, like there will be always something left outside of inclusion. This continuity and impossibility generates an illusion of political progress whereas it is only appropriation and manipulation of the same. When someone asks to dismantle the Centre, they are asking not to do this identity based inclusion as a political goal but attack the very system (Capitalism) that is facilitating it. 

If the above stated doesn't seem to make much sense, find the Hindi **ELI5** in the comments."," Imagine kar hum ek ***Gang*** bana rahe hain.

Ab tereko bolunga apne ko punter log chahiye. Aur tu bolega inclusive rakhte hain ki jyada se jyada punter log apne gang mein aaye aur hum sabse bade gang ban jayein.

Ab main bolega uska kya fayada?

Tu bolega bhai Democracy ka khel khelna hai to sabse bada gang hi jeetega.

Ab apun bolega theek hai. Recruit karte hain punter log.

Ab yahan pe issue hai.

Hum chahte hain ***Mahila*** punter bhi aaye aur ***bahujan dalit aadivasi*** sabhi punter join karein.

Ab iske liye hume kucch criteria to banana padega. Nahi to society aur apne gang mein kya farq rahega?

Ab uss criteria ko hum Center bol lete hain, jaise upar ke English paragraph mein bataya hai.

To agar hum sirf identity inclusion bhi chahte hain to humare gang mein waisi Mahila punter hi aa sakti hai jisko gang mein dalit punter ke hone se koi dikkat naa ho, aur waise dalit hi aa sakte hain jinhe aadivasi punter ke hone se koi dikkat naa ho.

Nahi to aapas mein hi larne lagenge gang wale.

Ye line jo hai, ki all punters must love each other, ye humara **Center** hai. According to the upar wala english paragraph.

Mahila punter, aadivasi punter, etc, ye humare *margins* hain.

Ab kya hai na, society BSDK Chutiya hai. Aur apne punter log isi ke product hain.

Aur bacha Capitalism, wo ek competitive system hai, jo punter logon ke aapas ke jhagde ko badhawa bhi deta hai aur exploit bhi karta hai. (ye mat poochna kaise, nahi to uske liye alag kahani likhni padegi, abhi ke liye maan lo aisa hota hai)

Ab ye saare margin ke punter log Center line of loving each other accept kar nahin payenge, aur jo humara inclusive gang banane ka plan tha, wo humare *gaand mein ghus jayega*.....

BJP has enough money to buy MLAs in Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh etc., but they want common people to contribute to this PM Cares fund.  


They (Modi Govt. / BJP) have money for running their IT cell, and for supporting massive PR campaigns for Modi, but they don't have money for investing in basic healthcare infrastructure in the country. They want (taxpaying) people to donate to pay for the sins of the govrnment. I would rather help my neighbours and my community than donate to these morons. Let all the Bhakts contribute now."," For the same reason they build that statue. PUBLICITY. Don't forget new parliament and central vista redevelopment project. To build more statues.

So you can die happily by seeing big statues. Because ""PM Cares"" /s I wonder why government has no money. 
Oh wait..what did Shashikant Das ,the new RBI governor do  1st thing he joined the office.? Oh yeah..empty the RBI Treasury saved for national emergency. The government doesn't care about serving the people, all they care about is staying in power for that they are ready to spend millions on statues Also, this PMcares is a new trust setup outside the ambit of the CAG right? The funds cannot be audited for how they were used I assume? They are essentially setting up a fund without parliamentary oversight if that is true, correct?

Arrgh, I have too many questions and I just cant seem to trust this government.

EDIT #1: It looks like others are asking the same question online. Also, it seems contributions to this fund are only 50% eligible for tax rebate whereas the PM relief fund (the older fund) is 100% tax rebate eligible. This is mysterious. Why the fuck would you want to contribute to the fund when you dont even get 100% tax rebate for what you donated? Also Bhakts are going on a rampage against those asking a valid question on twitter.

more discussion and *bhakt randi rona*: https://twitter.com/sardesairajdeep/status/1244573608015429638

EDIT #2: This is getting mukier. As of now, I hear public sector bank employees are being asked to give up two days of salary **MANDATORILY VOLUNTARILY** for this fund. Someone needs to dig into this to understand how this can be imposed on people mandatorily and that too for a shady trust fund that probably has no oversight. We must not forget that everything and everyone is used only for PR by this regime.once one understands that, other pieces automatically fall into place. Bro you don't understand it's another masterstroke... You know how Nehru is the source of all things evil? Well guess who introduced the PM's Relief Fund??

How the hell do you expect Nehru money to be good?? So our great great prime minister started the PMCARES because he cares about us!! Our great great modiji has been planning all along.... Not just to help covid19 patients but to flush out blek mon

Now watch helplessly in the next campaign when PMCARES fund is shoved down everyones throat as being the savior of the pandemic crisis and you know what the bhakts are gonna fap to it.... Trust me they already are probably thinking ""dusre leaders ne aisa kyu nai kiya ab tak"" People are emotional and govt milking it....btw he promised 15 lakhs in every account lol...and we giving more to him. Better give money to some NGO or to some poor personally. [deleted] Thats why I never donated to them. I will help whoever I can directly or through reputed NGOs 'PM-CARES' Oh the Irony. We should also ask that where is the massive amounts of money collected from DeMo, GST etc.? Meanwhile akshay kumar donating the same money donated to him by mudi Buying MLAs...  Thats what i have been rooting for ever since this whole fund was announced , bhakts trending hashtags like (virat kholi donate , akshay kumar donate etc) , i mean these people already pay 100s of crores in taxes , where the hell is that money going ? Why the taxpayers need to pay for their own well being ? That account isn't gov. Account they aren't obligated to show where money is spent. It will be used to buy mla in rajasthan. I get this is an anti BJP post, but I'd be happy if it were a post CRITICISING THE INCUMBENTS. 

We live in a country whose very Constitution has a Directive Principle relating to the development of scientific temper among people and the policymakers. 

But it is sad to see that as time passed, governments gave into divisive politics using the right wing ideology extensively along with hate sentiments. The educated cut themselves off from the democratic exercise and the uneducated started to elect policymakers. Hence, all we get is freebies and people pleasing stunts and nothing else. No structural reforms. And, to our dismay, people who really wished to work for the greater good, were never allowed to do so by their very own people. 

I have no problem with people hating a political party. But, it would've been pleasurable to see educated, technologically forward people critiquing the incumbents and not letting their hate for a said group get the better of them.

I say this holding in regard the very principle of a democratic set up which dictates that there are only legislators in the parliament, and no political parties. Sadly, our very own 'modern' and 'contemprary' leaders have lost sight of this axiom.

And let us not forget the times of the great statesman Mr. Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ji and Mr. Nehru, who truly displayed what a democratic country looks like, by their joint discussions about law and policy. And, not dragging their differences into the public domain and ripping each other to shreds, which is very, very common in this 21st Century India. To buy MLAs or to make more Statutes ? beggers in our own country. any idea how much the bjp has donated? They're asking for donations because they spent it all on statues. This was a tweet by him and there was no response, I guess.

[Twitter](https://twitter.com/ShashiTharoor/status/1243046184295346179?s=19) Why did they start a different fund called ""PM CARES"" instead of using the PM Relief Fund? How does one go about RTI-ing the PMNRF? The government and its brain dead supporters have no shame A forward went like “ Statues built by Modi are shut till 14th April, the hospitals built by Nehru are open 24/7”. They've given all the money to they crony capitalists. Those poor cronies need more money. please dont donate on pm care fund instead give money to nurses and doctors who will provide direct care, pm care fund will be corrupted by corrupt politicians in system Building statues makes up for tourism, but they aren’t really spending their funds on coronavirus for some reason. Even millionaires are donating but the government falls short. Sad, truly So modiji can come one night and boast how ppl have United blah blah blah...u know his speeches and garner praises. They denied the donations that were offered by the UAE government during the Kerala Floods and said that we are not a country that takes donations anymore, but one that gives donations.

544,Politics,Did Delhi just show us a new Election Template to effectively counter 'Hate' Politics?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f2kru3/did_delhi_just_show_us_a_new_election_template_to/,"Yesterday, as the counting started, I was glued to my TV, wondering about the fate of our democracy and questioning if people would still remain blindfolded. But not much to my surprise, voters of Delhi gave this huge mandate against the decisive policies and stood up with a progressive approach.

Now as the analysis were going on, experts on TV pointed out some really interesting traits of Kejriwal's Election campaign, which were basically some core reasons behind this victory:

>Not getting into communal vs secular scenario

>Made arguments on work profile.

>Assumed a soft hindutva position. Rejected an Idea that is Hindutva but not a belief that is Hinduism.

>Redefined 'Nationalism'. Rejected Bhajapa's version of the same thing.

>Avoided any direct, serious 'Dig' at NaMo

>Avoided Shaheen bagh

There maybe more than these. 

My question here is, are we seeing a new template here, one that other aspiring states can follow as well?"," Exit polls already predicted AAP's victory. I don't know why you're writing this post as if it's the 2007 T20 WC finals. The most important point you missed, that to counter 'Jai Shri Ram', they came with 'Jai Bajrang Bali'.

Now sangis are confused that how can we make the Ram's biggest devotee a muslaman. The reason AAP's election strategy worked well is because they had really solid and jumlaproof work to showcase. This particular strategy will not work in any other state because as of now they have no development to show. There is no fixed templates. Things do catch up with people. A strategy that worked 5 years ago may no longer work again. There are voters who are fixed voters no matter what. Or once they switch a party they will continue to vote for it .
 Then there are swing voters, these voters too may have made up their mind before the campaign even began.
Campaigns do have an effect on voters no doubt, BJP constantly tried to malign AAP using several traps like trying to move the discourse towards their strength. AAP never moved the battlefield there and instead stuck to their strengths no matter what their thoughts  were about issues BJP wanted to raise. 
BJP tried to expose conspiracies against AAP, using stray shooters allegiance to AAP, arresting Sisodias secretary etc etc. Ultimately those things didn't stop swing voters. This template may have worked for Delhi, but Bihar is a different election and the dynamics there are different. Same applies to WB. 
The best thing they can do is to try to kickstart campaigns and reach out programs early. Choose worthy candidates. Other than that there are poll strategeists for other things. >Avoided Shaheen bagh

Understandable. I think it's a pretty good move. Tables were turned once upon a time during the Emergency when Congress was in charge.

It's better AAP doesn't stand with Congress because without them they have more to gain than lose. This is Congress' moment of Tethics and AAP isn't going to comply. As an AAP supporter, I admire what Kejriwal is doing in Delhi and he is running a very focused campaign and not trying to get himself mixed up in all this but I also feel Kejriwal should take a bit more stand on this issue, skipping a meet called by Cong is one thing but not visiting students and standing with them is dissappointing but I hope post elections he will be much more vocal in his support. Good move, no need to mingle with congress. Good for them Excellent. Also about time that we stopped treating the INC as the primary opposition to the BJP. This just plays into the Modi-Pappu playbook. One of the reasons these protests have been so hard for these thugs to deal with is that the whole “this is RaGa running the show” trick hasn’t worked. the three stooges. maya, mamta and kejri AAP fans and admirers on this sub, how would you justify this!

I think it was a commencement address given at a college in Bombay. Here is my favourite story regarding Sam Bahadur: 

A young officer was on his round when one of the riflemen did not notice him and missed saluting him.
The youngster got cheesed off and summoned the Gorkha and asked him the reason for not saluting him. The Gorkha innocently gave out the reason that he did not see “Lieutenant Huzoor”.
The youngster not convinced, punished the Gorkha to a thousand salutes. The soldier immediately started saluting…
Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw who was passing by and asked the youngster as to what was happening. The youngster said, “Sir, this soldier had the audacity of not saluting me. So I have punished him with 1000 salutes.”
Sam replied, “Bloody good punishment young man, but ensure that you return each of his salutes.”
For the next two hours the unit was treated to a scene of a Gorkha saluting and the young officer returning each of his salutes. Surgeon treating him for machine gun wound: what happened to you?

Manekshaw: got kicked by a mule sir! Any idea where I can get a factual yet entertaining book to know more about the Bangladesh liberation war? “I’m always ready, Sweety”

Sam M. to Indra gandhi when asked to go to war edit: Manekshaw Don't change the name of towns to their old names. Rename the airports/Hospitals to our heroes. Always loved [this](https://youtu.be/L-tgRl_VK_Q) interview of his. Pure class. Without a doubt, he was a legend.  Super Bawa. Great to see and hear about him after so long.

Great man true legend and a true soldier he treated the pakistani soldiers as soldiers provided provisions and copys of quran and allowed them to celebrate festivals. after the victory in indo-pak war. and most importantly the true human. we salute you sam bahadur! An absolute legend. Legendary! I'm American. Are there a bunch of movies about him like there are about generals/soldiers here in the US? RIP.

Why is a legend though? I went through the wiki and it seems that he just happened to be the in charge during a tumultuous period in the subcontinent. He was a Parsi who spoke fluent Punjabi... God is Great!! One important aspect of this gentleman's conduct: He spoke out against the sexual violence that was a heartbreakingly massive part of the Indo-Pakistani War. He told his soldiers that rape was not acceptable and to not harrass women - regardless of background/religion/etc. Most military leaders of the time considered the issue irrelevant and sometimes - particularly on the Pakistani side (sorry, but it's true) - sexual violence was encouraged, organized, and weaponized. The myth?
What myth? Praise be Also probably the most famous Sherwoodian along with Amitabh Bachchan.

The **Jallianwala Bagh massacre**, also known as the **Amritsar massacre**, took place on 13 April 1919, when Acting Brigadier-General Reginald Dyer ordered troops of the British Indian Army to fire their rifles into a crowd of unarmed Indian civilians in Jallianwala Bagh, Amritsar, Punjab, killing at least 400 people including men and women. Over 1,000 people were injured.

Some facts about the Jallianwala Bagh massacre:

1. The precursor to the Massacre was the Rowlatt Act. This act was passed in February 1919.
2. The Rowlatt Act gave the British Government the authority to arrest anyone on grounds of mere suspicion.
3. The Rowlatt Act was basically designed for controlling activities of Indian Revolutionaries.
4. Protesting against the act, the Indians observed a hartal on March 30th and April 6th of 1919.
5. On April 10, 1919, two famous leaders, Dr. Kitchlew and Dr. Satyapal were arrested on the basis of the Rowlatt Act.
6. Two days later on the 12th of April, 1919, General Dyer took command of troops. He issued a proclamation banning all public gatherings
7. Though the proclamation was issued, no efforts were made to ensure that the general public came to know about it.
8. The gathering had no political intent at all. It was meant for celebrating Baisakhi – the Sikh festival.
9. Anywhere between 6,000 and 10,000 people gathered at Jallianwala Bagh on the evening of that day.
10. The gathering included even children and women since it was all about celebrating Baisakhi.
11. Though the festival was a Sikh festival, many Hindus and Muslims also came to celebrate the same. All of them were there for commemorating the day when Khalsa Panth was founded by Guru Gobind Singh.
12. Apart from the main entrance, there was no way for the crowd to escape the garden as the area was surrounded by buildings. This is a major reason for the high number of casualties.
13. Apart from Gurkha and  Baluchi soldiers using Scinde rifles, there were also two armored cars with machine guns that were used in the shooting.
14. According to records, the people gathered were not warned or asked to disperse before Colonel Dyer ordered the firing.
15. The firings stopped only when the soldiers ran out of ammunition.
16. The shooting was followed by the proclamation of [martial law](https://www.britannica.com/topic/martial-law) in the Punjab that included public floggings and other humiliations
17. Indian outrage grew as news of the shooting and subsequent British actions spread throughout the subcontinent. The Bengali poet and Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore renounced the knighthood that he had received in 1915.
18. Gandhi was initially hesitant to act, but he soon began organizing his first large-scale and sustained nonviolent protest ([*satyagraha*](https://www.britannica.com/topic/satyagraha-philosophy)) campaign, the [noncooperation movement](https://www.britannica.com/event/noncooperation-movement) (1920–22), which thrust him to prominence in the Indian nationalist struggle.
19. Dyer was initially lauded for his actions in Britain and became a hero among many who were directly benefiting from the [British Raj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj) such as members of the [House of Lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords). He was, however, widely criticised in the [House of Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons), whose July 1920 committee of investigation censured him.
20. The government of India ordered an investigation of the incident (the Hunter Commission), which in 1920 [censured](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/censured) Dyer for his actions and ordered him to resign from the military.
21. The last known survivor of the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre, Shingara Singh, died in Amritsar on June 29, 2009, at the age of 113.
22. The British Government tried to suppress information of the massacre, but news spread in India and widespread outrage ensued; details of the massacre did not become known in Britain until December 1919.
23. This event caused many moderate Indians to abandon their loyalty to the  British and become nationalists distrustful of the British
24. Colonel Dyer reported to his superiors that he had been ""confronted by a  revolutionary army"", to which Major General William Beynon replied:  ""Your action correct and Lieutenant Governor approves
25. Both [Secretary of State for War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_War) [Winston Churchill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill) and former Prime Minister [H. H. Asquith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._H._Asquith),  however, openly condemned the attack, Churchill referring to it as  ""unutterably monstrous"", while Asquith called it ""one of the worst, most dreadful, outrages in the whole of our history"".
26. Winston Churchill, in the House of Commons debate of 8 July 1920, said,  ""The crowd was unarmed, except with bludgeons. It was not attacking anybody or anything… When the fire had been opened upon it to disperse it,  it tried to run away. Pinned up in a narrow place considerably smaller than Trafalgar Square, with hardly any exits, and packed together so that one bullet would drive through three or four bodies, the people ran madly this way and the other. When the fire was directed upon the centre, they ran to the sides. The fire was then directed to the sides.  Many threw themselves down on the ground, the fire was then directed down on the ground. This was continued to 8 to 10 minutes, and it  stopped only when the ammunition had reached the point of exhaustion.""
27. After Churchill's speech in the House of Commons debate, MPs voted 247 to 37 against Dyer and in support of the Government.
28. The General Dyer-led massacre at Amritsar’s Jalianwalla Bagh, in 1919,  left an indelible dent on the psyche of millions of Indians.
29. Colonel Michael O'Dwyer was shot dead on 13 March, 1940, by a man named Udham Singh, a member of the revolutionist Ghadar party who was on a mission of revenge for the  Jallianwala Bagh Massacre.
30. The casualty number estimated by the Indian National Congress was more than 1,500 injured, with approximately 1,000 dead.
31. Indian nationalist [Swami Shraddhanand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swami_Shraddhanand) wrote to Gandhi of 1500 deaths in the incident.

1. **Shaheed Udham Singh** (26 December 1899 – 31 July 1940), was a  revolutionary belonging to the Ghadar Party best known for his  assassination in London of Michael O'Dwyer, the former lieutenant governor of Punjab in India, on 13 March 1940
2.  While in custody, he used the name **Ram Mohammad Singh Azad**, which represents the three major religions of Punjab and his anti-colonial sentiment 
3. Shaheed Uddham Singh waited 21 years for revenge by killing the man he held responsible for the atrocity: the then lieutenant governor of Punjab Province, General  Michael O'Dyer.
4. While awaiting his trial, Singh went on a 42-day hunger strike and was force-fed. On 4 June 1940
5. When asked about his motivation, Singh explained:

>I did it because I had a grudge against him. He deserved  it. He was the real culprit. He wanted to crush the spirit of my  people, so I have crushed him. For full 21 years, I have been trying to  seek vengeance. I am happy that I have done the job. I am not scared of  death. I am dying for my country.  I have seen my people starving in  India under the British rule. I have protested against this, it was my  duty. What greater honour could be bestowed on me than death for the  sake of my motherland?

Singh was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. On 31 July 1940, Singh was hanged at [Pentonville Prison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentonville_Prison).

# Following his conviction, he made a speech

which the judge directed should not be released to the press.\[9\] However, political activists who had set up the Shaheed Udham Singh Trust and working with the Indian Workers Association (GB), ran a campaign to have the court record of his statement published along with other material

He started the speech with a denunciation of British Imperialism:

>""I say down with British Imperialism. You say India do not have peace. We have only slavery Generations of so-called civilization has brought us everything filthy and degenerating. known to the human race.  All you have to do is read your own history. If you have any human decency about you, you should die with shame. The brutality and bloodthirsty way in which the so-called intellectuals who call themselves  rulers of civilization in the world are bastard blood . . .""  
>  
>At this point, he was interrupted by the judge, but after some discussion, he continued:  
>  
>""I do not care about the sentence of death. It means nothing at all.  I do not care about dying or anything. I do not worry about it at all. I  am dying for a purpose.’ Thumping the rail of the dock, he exclaimed,  ‘We are suffering from the British Empire.’ Udham Singh continued more quietly. ‘I am not afraid to die. I am proud to die, to have to free my native land and I hope that when I am gone, I hope that in my place will come thousands of my countrymen to drive you dirty dogs out; to free my country.  
>  
>""I am standing before an English jury. I am in an English court.  You people go to India and when you come back you are given a prize and put in the House of Commons. We come to England and we are sentenced to  death.’  
>  
>""I never meant anything, but I will take it. I do not care anything about it, but when you dirty dogs come to India there comes a  time when you will be cleaned out of India. All your British Imperialism  will be smashed.’ ""Machine guns on the streets of India mow down thousands of poor  women and children wherever your so-called flag of democracy and  Christianity flies.’  
>  
>""Your conduct, your conduct – I am talking about the British government. I have nothing against the English people at all. I have more English friends living in England than I have in India. I have great sympathy with the workers of England. I am against the Imperialist  Government.’  
>  
>""You people are suffering – workers. Everyone are suffering through these dirty dogs; these mad beasts. India is only slavery.  Killing, mutilating and destroying – British Imperialism. People do not read about it in the papers. We know what is going on in India.""  
>  
>At this point, the judge refused to hear any more, but Singh continued:  
>  
>""You ask me what I have to say. I am saying it. Because you people are dirty. You do not want to hear from us what you are doing in  India.  
>  
>He then thrust his glasses back into his pocket, and exclaimed three words in Hindustani and then shouted:  
>  
>'Down with British Imperialism! Down with British dirty dogs!""  
>  
>He turned to leave the dock, spitting across the solicitor’s table.

His remains are preserved at the Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar, Punjab.  On every 31 July, marches are held in Sunam by various organizations and every statue of Singh in the city is paid tribute with flower garlands.

8. [Better India](https://www.thebetterindia.com/95695/udham-singh-punjab-jallianwala-bagh-massacre/)"," That was highly informative. Thanks for this post! I'd just like to add one thing- The carnage left behind by Dyer was witnessed by a young Bhagat Singh which eventually lead him to become disillusioned with Gandhi's ideals of non-violence. 

Given the quality and frequency of your posts, I presumed you were one of the Mods. Random fact. General Reginal Dyer's father Edward Abraham Dyer set up a brewery in Kasauli, Himachal Pradesh to cater to the British requirement for cheap beer. This brewery changed hands and became a distillery by the name of Mohan Meakin Pvt. Ltd. Which is popularly known as **OLD MONK** TIL the gathering had no political intent. I always thought there was an element of protest too, against the detention of Saifuddin Kitchlew and Lala Lajpat Rai (I think). Thanks for the info!     29. Colonel Reginald Dyer was shot dead on 13 March, 1940, by a man named Udham Singh

I believe you've mistakenly mixed Michael O'Dwyer name with Colonel Reginald Dyer. Lovely. Please make a compilation of the Anti Sikh riots of 1984 as well if possible.. wow the movies only say about the Dyer running back to UK and never returning back to India.  
I did not know that he was assassinated until I read your post. Thanks for telling me something new. Have an upvote OP! :) Almost 80 years after Shaheed Udham Singh was executed, we still swim nose deep in imperialism and millions of children die every year because of imperialist exploitation.

They say, ""There are no guns anymore"", but that only means death is slower and more painful.  Nice Read more about it and the general surrounding conditions and the apparent British thinking behind it read Jallianwala Bagh: An Empire Of Fear And The Making Of The Amritsar Massacre. `Though the festival was a Sikh festival, many Hindus and Muslims also came to celebrate the same. All of them were there for commemorating the day when Khalsa Panth was founded by Guru Gobind Singh.` 

This. That Hindu-Muslim-Sikh-Isae bhai bhai feeling :)

Mera aaj ka TIL hogaya re. *Dhanyawaad Prabhu!* Bhai only 4 points are required karke teacher ne bola tha itna kyun likha YSK: General Dyer, the main guy responsible for the massacre returned to England and died of old age. The Dyer that udham Singh assassinated was also involved but was a totally different person I mean the point about Gandhi isn't really a surprise. He was "" hesitant"" to do anything against the British. A man who's entire life's work is based on the concept of non violence, recruiting 2 million Indians to fight for the allies to show the British government Indians don't mean any "" animosity"" towards them. Either you lot are crazy for thinking he's the father of the nation or I'm crazy for thinking that if anything, that guy just slowed down the independence process. He used to call himself Ram Mohammad Singh Azad. Off Topic: I visited the Jallianwala Bagh in November last year but sadly it was under renovation and very poorly maintained. I hope it is in a much better now. I was surprised to see how close it is to the Golden Temple. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuYgICoMer8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuYgICoMer8) There's just one thing that people gloss over whenever discussing the Jallianwala Baugh massacre. Dyer's motivations. What could make a person act in such a manner? Well, history has answers for that.

>Especially in Punjab, the situation was deteriorating rapidly, with disruptions of rail, telegraph, and communication systems. The movement was at its peak before the end of the first week of April, with some recording that ""practically the whole of Lahore was on the streets, the immense crowd that passed through Anarkali was estimated to be around 20,000"".[31] Many officers in the Indian army believed revolt was possible, and they prepared for the worst. The British Lieutenant-Governor of Punjab, Michael O'Dwyer, is said to have believed that these were the early and ill-concealed signs of a conspiracy for a coordinated revolt planned around May, on the lines of the 1857 revolt, at a time when British troops would have withdrawn to the hills for the summer.

>The Amritsar massacre and other events at about the same time, have been described by some historians as the end result of a concerted plan by the Punjab administration to suppress such a conspiracy.[32] James Houssemayne Du Boulay is said to have ascribed a direct relationship between the fear of a Ghadarite uprising in the midst of an increasingly tense situation in Punjab, and the British response that ended in the massacre.[33]

>On 10 April 1919, there was a protest at the residence of Miles Irving, the Deputy Commissioner of Amritsar. The demonstration was to demand the release of two popular leaders of the Indian Independence Movement, Satya Pal and Saifuddin Kitchlew, who had been earlier arrested by the government and moved to a secret location. Both were proponents of the Satyagraha movement led by Gandhi. A military picket shot at the crowd, killing several protesters and setting off a series of violent events. Riotous crowds carried out arson attacks on British banks, killed several British people and assaulted two British females.[34]

>**On 11 April, Marcella Sherwood, an English missionary, fearing for the safety of her pupils, was on her way to shut the schools and send the roughly 600 Indian children home.[9][35] While cycling through a narrow street called the Kucha Kurrichhan, she was caught by a mob, pulled to the ground by her hair, stripped naked, beaten, kicked, and left for dead. She was rescued by some local Indians, including the father of one of her pupils, who hid her from the mob and then smuggled her to the safety of Gobindgarh Fort.[35][36] After visiting Sherwood on 19 April, the Raj's local commander, Colonel Dyer, issued an order requiring every Indian man using that street to crawl its length on his hands and knees.[9][37] Colonel Dyer later explained to a British inspector: ""Some Indians crawl face downwards in front of their gods. I wanted them to know that a British woman is as sacred as a Hindu god and therefore they have to crawl in front of her, too.""** [38] He also authorised the indiscriminate, public whipping of locals who came within lathi length of British policemen. Marcella Sherwood later defended Colonel Dyer, describing him ""as the saviour of the Punjab"".[37]

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jallianwala_Bagh_massacre

The JB Massacre took place shortly thereafter. This event cemented in Dyer's heart a hatred for Indians. Was he right in doing what he did? No. Hell no. He's just as bad as the mob that did what it did to the innocent missionary woman. But I understand what he did. I am truly disgusted by his actions, but I understand why he behaved like he did. I also understand why the mob behaved the way it did, but I am equally disgusted by their actions."

Situation has turned extremely ugly. Government isn't doing anything to stop the violence. They aren't even trying. All this happening during Trump's visit seems to indicate that Modi and his ilk may have lost control of the narrative. >Al Hind Hospital-

>Mobs of right wing goons have surrounded the hospital and are not letting ambulances, doctors and medical aid reach the hospital. 

>Injured are in critical condition and need immediate help.  >DelhiBurning#DelhiRiots

https://twitter.com/ThePeopleOfIN/status/1232357339715387393?s=19 Once again, I don't understand the reason for this entire thing. Political rumor mills were clear that BJP was going to tone down the NRC thing before Bihar at the behest of Nitish Kumar. Hence Amit Shah's statements of regret at the communal turn in Delhi elections.

Next, all eyes were on New Delhi because of Trump. Consequently, these riots are front page stores in NYT. At any other time, it might have been on the 'World' page or heck, not covered at all.

So the timing of this is very off. 

Internal factions fighting for control within BJP? Or has BJP lost control over its rogue elements? TimesNow and Republic are saying that this riots is because of social activists spreading fake news on Twitter. Again from Gujarat playbook. Modi kept blaming the media for inciting the riots when his own party leaders were involved. #BREAKING

 1. Premkant saved lives of six muslims neighbours when crowd put their home on fire. One old lady was still stuck, he got burnt while saving her. His situation is critical after 70% burn, but Prem is happy that he saved mom of his friend.

2. This muslims family risked their lives to save their Hindu neighbors and became a wall between them and rioters . From Mustafabad.

Anyone who needs a place to stay in Northeast Delhi or any family who needs any help, please feel free to contact me. Our houses are ALWAYS open. Forward it to anyone looking for a place.

https://twitter.com/kawalpreetdu/status/1231993832138395649?s=19 A friend of mine from Miranda House just told me that there is a presence of a mob with guns rallying around University Campus. Can't confirm yet though. Some people in my area are calling ""Kattar hindus"" for meeting in temple , they are the reason why riots are happening in my area , hopefully now the police forces has arrived here Just imagine if BJP had won delhi..... I was co-ordinating with a doctor at Al Hind Hosp for medicines yesterday. By the time I called back and said medicines arranged but will take some time, he said- “par mera bhai to mar gaya” (But my brother is dead) and broke down on the phone with me, a stranger.

https://twitter.com/atti_cus/status/1232490621031464962?s=19 Just so you know, the Solicitor General of India is spending your taxes to fight against the filing of FIRs for hate speech in the Delhi High Court. The SC has washed its hands of the matter. Stop looking to the Courts to save you. They are already compromised. I am having a hard time figuring out what's true and what is not anymore.

I feel lost. .@DelhiPolice destroying CCTV Cameras near Khureji Khas Protest site.

https://twitter.com/ethicalsid/status/1232619319810502656?s=19 >No one, be it any party, should be spared if they are responsible for inciting violence. Even if he is a part of my cabinet, he should be punished. If anyone from AAP is found guilty, they should get double the punishment.

- Arvind Kejriwal In one part of Delhi, a gurdwara opens its doors to Muslims and anyone who needs shelter.
In Seelampur, Dalits blocked the roads against mobs, sheltered their Muslim neighbours.

Police and politicians have forgotten their duty; but the people have courage and heart.

 https://twitter.com/nilanjanaroy/status/1232303148766617601?s=19 Why in the world I stand with kapil mishra hashtag getting popular , these it cells and bhakts are just making situation worse So when they said Gujarat model they essentially meant the Gujarat 2002 model.

so true History repeats itself. From the Sikh Massacre of 1984 in Delhi to Gujrat, and so on. The silver lining here being that many people are connected via the net and social media. Until things are resolved, everything MUST be documented and archived. The government and Delhi police must be held accountable for continuously allowing mob rule and, yet again, failing to protect it's citizens. Over 200 million Muslims call India home. Widespread anti-Muslim mob violence has killed at least 27 and injured many more. Trump responds by saying, ""That's up to India."" This is a failure of leadership on human rights.

https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1232763321163579395?s=19 How did @DelhiPolice grant Kapil Mishra the permission for a ""peace march"" y'day after everything that has happened? Or was the march taken out without permission?

RTI to @DCPNewDelhi who seems eager to give permission to Kapil Mishra but was prompt in rejecting my request. 

https://twitter.com/SaketGokhale/status/1233320428464037888?s=19 >CM @ArvindKejriwal - if u r done with Hanuman Chalisa & Sundar Kaand, can u wake up, go to the LG’s residence, & not leave until there’s answers given by Delhi Police? 

>The trope of “police isn’t under me” is old now. U sat at the LG’s residence earlier. 

>What’s stopping u now?

https://twitter.com/SaketGokhale/status/1231968726657818624?s=19 Man, when we said we wanted to relive the 90s, we meant Swat Kats and Jungle Book, not riots I don't understand the wisdom of Kapil Mishra's threats on the eve of Trump's visit. BJP top brass would have known that any violence right now will taint all the positive international press Modi would have received. 

All this signals is that Modi isn't a strong enough leader to keep the city that's hosting the most powerful man in the world peaceful

Surely BJP wouldn't sabotage themselves like this? Elections are over. Amit Shah even made reconciliatory noises after Delhi elections. 

So why now? My uncle's car and bikes were burnt right outside his house in Yamuna Vihar. A rabid, violent mob was going to burn his house also. The BJP councilor living next door has friendly relations with him. He requested the mob to let the family leave. They barely managed to escape.

...and this is a privileged muslim, imagine the plight of the poor without any relations with terrorists of BJP https://twitter.com/BDUTT/status/1232274028045332486?s=19

With all respect to the police constable who lost his life & a few good men doing their job, please look at this video from yesterday. The police not just do nothing to stop the mob from pelting stones, it  appears to charge with the mob as they race to attack #DelhiViolence Situation getting bad in nearby areas of shaheen bagh. Mobs are mobilizing. Police deployment increased.

 There are only 3 Indian CM's who have successfully stopped full blown riots in their State  

1) Jyoti Basu (1984 & 1992)   

2) Lalu Prasad Yadav (1990 - Arrested Advani & stopped his Rath yatra)  

3) Pinarayi Vijayan (2018 - Arrested more than 3500 Sanghis during Sabarimala Protest) Seven people, including a head constable, were killed and several others injured as violence spiralled over the amended citizenship law in northeast Delhi. Section 144 has been imposed in northeast Delhi for one month while home minister Amit Shah has called a meeting with Delhi CM, LG and other leaders.

Sexual violence against women confirmed. Many mobs entered houses.

(12:15AM // 26.02.2020)

https://twitter.com/NrcProtest/status/1232389094325379072?s=19 Hindus were not under any khatra in 2014 (at that time, it was sabka vikas). 

But they are in khatra in 2020

So 6 years of Modi government put Hindus in khatra. Really makes you think Today one of my co-worker, a die-hard BJP supporter, despite knowing I am from Shaheen Bagh said to my face that he wished someone took tractor and ran over the protestors in Shaheen Bagh. It just sent chills down my spine. 
Not even once I have heard in office openly support anti-NRC protest, but I get to hear blood curdling hateful things about protest, some people say it loud enough to make me hear it on purpose. 
People have become so heartless, I definitely fear for my life and my future in this nation. I have fear of speaking up and can not imagine being in position where I might be lynched. It is so scary. I don't go to Shaheen Bagh, I don't talk about any politics in office and just shut my mouth. I hope this is not the future. I cant be expected to just shut up forever if I want to live in my own country, I hope someday people are thinking twice before saying hateful things 
I want out. Didn't ask for this. Take your country, make it great or do whatever the fuck you want to do with it, just don't fucking lynch me. Twitter is such a cesspit right now. They keep blaming anti-caa protestors and trying to use it to instigate more violence against minorities. I honestly just really want to cry. I don't have anywhere to rant, so I am just gonna go ahead here. What the fuck has happened to Delhi? What the fuck is wrong with people? Out of nowhere this shit starts happening?! Isn't our capital supposed to be safe any more? Why doesn't the police just arrest these elements and put them in jail? I am so sick of the country burning over this thing for so long now. It is tarnishing the image of the country and is also creating disharmony among it's citizens. I am just so annoyed and angry. With social media this is worse than any part. at least that one whole India did not witness and only heard about it later. This one is a live show and whole India is watching it take place in front of their own eyes. Only the strong hearted will be able to sleep peacefully in this turmoil. 

Bless the poor soul. Hopefully they will learn religion will never come to their rescue and hope this diminishes some of the faith in religion Hear Danish explain what happened exact at Ashok Nagar on 25 February.

I am saddened but this is going to benefit him even further. How could the national capital go down to this level.

I'm just sad that people are more concerned about members of their own community,party etc getting killed  but not bothered when people from other community,party etc are killed.This sort of selective outrage is quite concerning.End of the day everyone is going to face the consequences from the violence and riots.

DelhiRiots I don't think they planned it that way, but I suspect the cops are now going to use the right wing violence that they deliberately failed to control as a post facto justification for why the blocked many roads around protest sites like shaheen bagh. It'll be a big fat lie, but the supreme court being what it is, it might actually buy it, rather than punishing the cops who failed to control the mob that was threatening violence for weeks.

All the areas which have witnessed targeted communal violence—Maujpur, Chand Bagh, Karawal Nagar, Bhajanpura, Babarpur, among others—come the under Karawal Nagar, Ghonda, Rohtas Nagar, and Ganghi Nagar assembly constituencies which the saffron party won in the February 2020 polls. In addition, these four assembly seats come under the North East Delhi Lok Sabha constituency which is represented by Manoj Tiwari, the BJP's Delhi chief. All of these areas have a sizeable Muslim population, enough to polarise the localities.](https://caravanmagazine.in/religion/delhi-violence-north-east-maujpur-jaffrabad-babarpur-muslims-hindu) Authoritarian plutocracy is here to stay guys.

Obviously today's economics too wants you to know nothing about inequality. Always remember, it's these bloody cronies who bankroll these fascists , coz your blood = their profits.

I went Shivpuri, Bhajanpura, Mustafabad today and if there is ANY journalist who says both sides have been targeted, they are lying pure and simple.

Just writing this because I feel helpless and this somehow helps a little. Hang in there buddy, hope things stay ok for you. As a Muslim, I knew people had negative views against us but I never imagined it would be on such a level. I've never felt any form of animosity whenever I'm around regular Hindus.   



I'm thankful to have many Hindu friends who actually know that this is wrong and actively condemn it.  I'm the only Muslim person in the group and they have been supportive.


From the circle of people i interact with/used to interact, I've only encountered one person who is a proper bhakt and spits poison.


Now it's not just anti-CAA, the right wing are enjoying this chaos or feel that the violence is justified because we 'jihadi' people are protesting against a law.


It gives them an immense satisfaction to kill or beat a Muslim. 







And a significant portion of the mass wants this.



A significant number of Indians want a hindu rashtra.



Many will take a neutral stand  and allow this to continue.




I just  want to fucking leave this country. 






Anywhere.



All I want in life anymore is just enough to get by and   a place where people don't want to harm me for my existence.



If such an assault can be conducted in our country's capital city , where even the police are providing assistance to them and the perpetrators do not have to face any repercussions, then no place is safe in India.









Even if you're privileged and have a lot of money, you cannot escape the hatred.



Now I'm  contemplating to drop out my course and seek education elsewhere just so I can leave this miserable place.  This is risky.


I didn't take this option earlier because our financial situation is extremely unstable. 




Don't have any arrangements for funds and we struggle a lot to get by our expenses but I'm willing to take student loans just so I can get out.




I'm still young(20) so I'm extremely lucky to have time on my hands.




Am I thinking straight?



This would make the last 2 years seem like a complete waste.



Does this sound rational or am I making a hasty decision because my brain is exhausted. To those who say the transfer of the judge was predecided, I say that this government's odd working hours are pretty impressive.

From swearing in a CM in the wee hours of the morning to signing transfer papers at midnight, they're all really superb owls. When a Hindu kills a Muslim, it’s “communal violence,” but when a Muslim fights back in self defense, it’s “Islamic terrorism.”

soon enough we'll have no investments in this country, who wants to invest in a war torn shithole? economy,environment,social fabric they have fucked everything A lot of thoughts

1. By this time, everyone knows this was an organised crime. Both parties at fault. But delhi police, which is supposed to serve and protect the citizens is seen on record helping the mob to instigate more violence, and is caught live on video destroying CCTVs that's when you lose hope. Having said that, both parties should be held responsible. 

2. Alot of unrest in common man, frankly everyone everywhere is scared. And like or not, what's unfortunate id that there are a ton of ppl filled with bloodlust and hatred for the other party.

3. The media played a big part in the narrative. Nearly all Indians believe what they see on TV and when your fav news channel is biased towards one side and tries to narrate the whole situation in a certain angle, you're just fueling more hatred into the common people. And the only one who benefits from it is the media itself.

4. The sudden transfer of judge just proves that the government is trying to bend the law, it's a statement that they can do anything and get away it while slapping the whole truth on your face.


5. Economic slowdown is real, and with the added unfortunate events of past few days, expect alot of prices to go up sooner or later, it's gonna take a long to heal.


6. Finally, a question to all Redditors. How do you think the whole situation should've been handled? And what measures should the people and the govt/higher ups should take in the future. And what laws/changes should be created if needed any? https://twitter.com/JamiaMehfil/status/1232032574119112705?s=20 [Someone's report from north-east delhi](https://imgur.com/a/0hwvZLi) >UPDATE : Shoot at sight orders at Jaffrabad remain.

There are only 3 Indian CM's who have successfully stopped full blown riots in their State

1) Jyoti Basu (1984 & 1992) 

2) Lalu Prasad Yadav (1990 - Arrested Advani & stopped his Rath yatra)

3) Pinarayi Vijayan (2018 - Arrested more than 3500 Sanghis during Sabarimala Protest)

Press Release
26.02.2020 | 11:40 am

At about 12:30 am in the night a call was given for gherao of the CM’s house to demand that effective measures be taken to control the violence being unleashed on the muslims of north-east delhi. At about 3:30 am water cannons were used to disperse the protestors. However, the protestors held their ground. Police then beat up the protestors and detained them at Civil lines Police station at about 4 am. Around 8am police took the 41 detained protestors to Aruna Asif Ali hospital under the pretext of giving them medical aid and subsequently releasing them. However, they have been forced to undergo MLC’s amidst heavy police presence. Lawyers are not being allowed to talk with them. Police has confirmed that they will be taken back to civil lines police station post the MLC procedure. 
Doctors at Aruna Asif Ali hospital are being pressurised to give a ‘normal’ report in the MLC’s. 
President and Treasurer of AAJMI, Shafa ur Rehman and Adv. Areeb Hassan, are among the detained protestors, along with members of the Jamia Coordination Committee and other advocates. 
Peaceful protestors are being treated like criminals. There phones have been confiscated. 
We demand that the protestors be immediately released. There are serious concerns about the health and safety of the detained protestors. So, this *shoot at sight* order, does this apply to shaheen bagh and similar sit-ins? Can we have a thread to collect all the verified videos and photos of the riots? It's the least our keyboard warriors can do for the victims of the riots... 
One Twitter thread is doing this already:

Translation for non hindi folks. 1984 all over again Just a gentle reminder that the Delhi govt doesn't have powers on Law and order or Police though both the subjects fall under state lists and since Delhi is a  UT, it comes under the center's Responsibility. First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—
     Because I was not a socialist.

Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out—
     Because I was not a trade unionist.

Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—
     Because I was not a Jew.

Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.

Do not relay cheap narratives peddled by seed accounts of the IT cell. Tell the stories of all the victims. How are there so many people abusing and bashing muslims and seculars on twitter. Where do they come from, they just keep coming at you with hate and threats, non-stop.. I voted for BJP, mostly because we had no option. Never in my wildest dreams, I imagined that they would act like this in their 2nd term. (They did some shitty stuff in their first term too but at least there were no riots).

I feel ashamed that I voted for BJP. 35 dead till now... 80+ injured ... Shit is bad... :( This is a genocide in the making >Please let’s stop calling them pro CAA. Let’s call them what they are - Anti Muslim. They don’t give a damn about CAA.. they just hate the fact that Muslims have the same rights as them.

At least those middle east countries  the Americans fuel it without bothering their own countrymen but here in India we are replicating it within our own countrymen and think this will not have any consequences to the society's psyche. Today its them tomorrow it will be within your own.

Trump was installed in USA as he simply cannot change the way the society lives there. He can only trouble China - Iran and the foreign nations. Within USA they live under law and order and even powerful guy like Harvey who engages with the best of the best politically /socially has to follow the law and spend time in jail.

Modi is a dumb arse  and seems to be doing the foreign bidding in destabilizing India itself. Sometime i feel he is a Chinese bot as  to why would he himself destroy his own country. I mean you have 200million Muslims in your country where the fuck will they go. if push  comes to shove natural instinct is to fight back. Right now you don't even know about the rapes. This horror only comes out once the riots are over and if the victims survive. [Goons dressed police tries to break in houses.](https://twitter.com/fraughtiana/status/1232183080221323266?s=20) it feels like these riots are like 1 % version of 2002 riots... communal clashes. muslims vs hindu..  and the head of the state keeping quite.

*That's the difference.

Compare and contrast. Gurudwaras helped everyone regardless of their religion. Many other Hindus and Muslims did too.

But the BJP terrorist who started the riots is so shameless in his sectarianism Reports coming of shops of Hindus in Maujpur being burnt. In Kardampuri all shops are being looted and burnt no matter who owns it. Delhi burning! #DelhiViolence  #DelhiBurning

If it's true, then things have escalated to worse than I had ever imagined. I am tired of seeing these Hindu-Muslim clashes.

I think what the government could have done regarding CAA was to just properly define ""religious persecution"" in the act instead of deciding and specifying which religions face persecution, and then there wouldn't have been so many protests by people misunderstanding the goal of CAA.

Ex-Muslims too face persecution in Pakistan and Bangladesh, and they might not have converted to any of the religions specified in the act.

Edit: u/9rj below has provided some links to organizations that people can support via donations and exposure. And it's important to spread the news on social media, share the horror of the riots (videos, etc) which is devastating, and pressure local governments to levy sanctions against India until action is taken.

1. The women who chanted ""Pak zind****"" 
2. Kapil Mishra hate mongering speech to incite the crowd. 
3. What happened today when they brought pro-caa goons with them and police decided to choose which side they are on. Not a hard guess at all,  they love seeing Muslims getting there ass kicked. 
4. Coming soon. Modi's famed Gujarat Model right here.

2020's 2002 all over again. The RW intelligentsia including ORF chairman Chikarmane, Ranganathan, Yashwant Deshmukh are all spinning this as a violence incited because of the instigation and the mob having no respect for Democracy in the country and making it about Modi.

Pathetic state of affairs from the leadership of the country Where is Priyanka Gandhi now? 0 seats meant no empathy fr ppl of Delhi. Is delhi police allowing this to happen or what..?

They need enforce a curfew or something right now and stop the rioters regardless of which side they are on. We cannot allow our national capital to go in chaos like this. In this video from the violence in northeast Delhi’s Chand Bagh, a Muslim saint shrine appears to have been torched by locals.

Locals are carrying petrol bombs, shouting pro-Hindu slogans while setting the shrine on fire.

Or how bad can it get in other parts of the country. 

It's just terrifying. We've all heard of Jesus's second coming. We now need Gandhi's second coming. I've seen multiple videos where these terrorists are threatening to attack Shaheen Bagh on the 5th.


What is being done about this (by the protestors)?


Are the protestors taking precaution?



There's  only one thing I expect from the police so let's not go there. Hello @ArvindKejriwal, have you heard of the person who died after being beaten-up by police? Kindly announce the compensation of 1 crore for all those who have been killed in the riots. Unless, of course selectivity and populism is your mantra now.

But when people from the ruling class and majority are breaking all kinds of laws, engaging in acts of terror and acting against the interests of the public and the state, why are we not doing the same. The media, the Celebrities and other influencers are all responsible for widening the communal divisions by endorsing the actions of the majority party. The divide is so large that there is no rational line of thought, people are made to believe what the leaders want them to believe..all reporting is biased and people widely share it and believe it, without giving a thought it could have been doctored. The misinformation is the biggest enemy of the people and it is burning our nation. Ankit Sharma was reportedly stabbed 400 times. That is peak brutality. We want justice for Ankit Sharma and every innocent killed in the riots.

Children are crying but the delivery process is really slow because police isn't helping. 
Violence is not happening in most but violence is still happening in  some areas especially shiv Vihar. It hasn't stopped. Even going with a police personnel is unsafe there. We were assessing an area near shiv Vihar today and saw Muslim man being attacked. Mob was checking his penis to know his religion. (Military was carrying out a flag March two lanes away) We don't know whether they left him or killed him. They had a spear pointed at him. . When we were passing through that area we were scared for our life. People were staring at us and talking shit.

> Delhi death toll reaches 23. Three probable theories on why we are seeing violence,

* Force the Muslims to abandon their very successful anti  CAA/NRC campaign that makes great use of potent national symbols like the flag and the constitution. Muslims especially women marching with students, doing peaceful sit-ins with flags and the constitution makes for great visuals. The way to disrupt this is to further reinforce Muslim helplessness by acts of police brutality, mob violence, judicial indifference, telling them that even attention from the world's most powerful country will not help them, scaring away their young allies with draconian laws. Create enough distrust to move muslims and hindus away from openly hindu but not against muslim parties like aap.

* Some one is trying to embarrass modi by showing how inept and helpless he is in front of the international media. 

* This a natural outcome of all the hate mongering and this is how things escalate when you try and tamper with things as basic as citizenship of a country. Why aren't people making dolls of modi/shah and burning them? The most recent list of the dead. 38 counted.

Edit: I had pm'ed him too. He just replied. He is ok ! No violence today right? Hope peace comes back to the capital from today It is highly imperative to amend laws to make the department ensuring law and order an independent body just like the Judiciary. We have come across a myriad number of instances of loss of life and property due to the inaction of police. Within a span of 3 days, the riots have injured more than 200 people and killed close to 27 people. The leaders still seem to be playing the political blame game. I think it's high time for everybody to understand that some situations are beyond politics. Surely CAA is going to get scrapped. Right?


Are they willing to riot and kill thousands if that's what it takes to  not remove CAA? UPDATE : Bhirampuri

the timing of all this doesn't look like a coincidence, it started happening exactly when trump is in india?

now doing all this while trump is in india doesn't benefit BJP? because it will get more international media attention ? so who is actually doing it? Step 1: Burn down houses and businesses of Muslims, so they lose documents. 

Step 2: Accuse them of being illegal immigrants, demand documents 

Step 3: throw them in detention camps, where they will ultimately die. 

Step 4: Ram Rajya! 

Step 5: on the way to heaven, stop to rescue a dog and refuse to enter without it. 

Step 6: Heaven requests documents. >VIDEO : #Chandbagh

Before this Shah got Davinder Singh arrested (Doval's man)

All  this because Shah wants to be next PM. Also notice how Modi who loves  limelight has had less of it in this term than the previous one. Just a dumb question, Is most of the violence being in the BJP constituencies won from the recent election or is it like the whole city? I've got some of my family in South Delhi.

I mean common people would never take pistol in their hands...right? 
man.. the state of politics in India is so fucked right now, very sad. We should use the slogan "" Desh ke gaddaro ko goli maro salo ko"", with more intensity than it is being used by the bhakts because in reality those rioters and brainwashed idiots are the real gaddar. Use their tactics on them. **Ground recon**

Shiv vihar - muslim household - completely burnt - gali 6 to 22 - RAF at crossroads - suspicions of violence between brijpuri road and shiv vihar Muslim households - people not allowed to go around - from shamshan ghat to chaman park - Hindus in adjacent regions are mostly fine - mosques are burnt down - all the individuals fled to chaman park, chand bagh, etc living in various places adjacent to Shiv Vihar Muslim household Haven't there been violence from both sides so why is there condemnation of one side ? I am just asking for an explanation please don't bang my head against the floor .

Stones being unloaded by group of people holding saffron flags. So glad I left this shitty country :) It's not Hindus or Muslims, the people of Delhi are horrible and have a fucked up mentality and this is based off my experience in that city of cunts. Delhi as a whole is easily the worst place to live on the planet. I always supported india. Preferred india over separation or Pakistan. Wanted to contribute to the nation. But 5th August and what followed changed me so much as a person that now i just type Delhi after a day or 2 , read the headlines and move on. I am not affected even in the slightest.

A vast majority of arm chair Modi bhakts from their living room will finally see what Modi's route is doing to India whatever little of it was built in the last 50 odd years. This will stop the blood cry as there is going to be a huge cost for the nation and one which will surely take India 30-40 years behind within a short span. This will make the religious bigots realize  Hindu Rashtra will have to go via the fire route and its not easy to trample over 200mil and just their defense mechanism /survival instinct  in fighting back itself will lead to destruction of the nation.

""

I think Gandhis have some sort of sword hanging over their head and it seems they have a choice between jail time or just lurk around purposely to prevent any alternative leadership. Modi-Shah have done all this to Mulayam / Akhilesh / mayawati and many oolder but corrupt leaders. Only lalu did not bend hence is in jail. 

Hold  fair election without replacing EVM box - result will be astonishing as India is always a fair nation and never entertains extremist ideas.

Congress has always been there middling choice and they have rejected alternative govt of  Morarji / Janta part within  3 years. Next one VP singh got a short term too . But Rajiv gandhi got assassinated so Congress never recovered properly but still kept pace via manmohan singh. My biggest surprise was in 2004  when people rejected even Vajpayee and Advani for a stint which wasn't too bad by any standard and even then  brought back Sonia/ Manmohan.

Hence Modi coming back to power in 2019 after 5 years of disaster 2014-2019  is something i cannot digest could never imagine even with  Pulwama which was by all means a inside job. The mood of the nation as shown in state election in 2018 dec/jan in MP / Rajasthan / Chattisgarh and Punjab was very clear and without rigging they won.

Why do people  doubt elections are a scam now. if they can control Police / Judiciary / Supreme Court and even the armed forces to an extent what makes you think EC is some holy cow ??? who the fuck heads Election Commission - a simple IAS ?  I believe there was no EVM hacking but mass scale replacement of EVM boxes. Thats why the time between each phases of election to manipulate.

Coming to your question Priyanka Gandhi is the leader  India needs in terms of charisma Education / Thinking and attitude.

I understand that you guys hate Modi but atleast don’t go so far beyond that you lose touch with reality. I have family and friends living in Maujpur and nearby areas and their accounts are absolutely chilling.

Dainik Jagran poll| was violence in dehli premeditated to oppose CAA? [deleted] [deleted] It's easy to blame the police when you are not on the ground risking your lives. In situations like this when keyboard warriors are threatening each other in the comfort of another city or country. 
Think of the understaffed and ungeared policemen who wear helmets to protect themselves.

We as a society encourage violence by same policemen when it suits us as the viral video of people being beaten when they boarded the wrong coaches. We still live in a society which legally seeks death for a person. Everyone seems to have ignored and is laughing at the rapist who is trying self harm in a desperate attempt to save his life.

Context of an action is equally important, remember your perspective is designed by the person who is taking the video and it's chronology and the usual yada yada. Imagine you are being shot at or being pelted with murderous projectiles and you happen to catch the person. 

I am not justifying the unprofessional attitude of many policemen but they also come from our society and we need to be better to expect better from them. 

Most importantly stop spreading hysteria which may stop someone from genuinely seeking help and judging a profession from an incomplete understanding. It's clear who's causing the violence now. 

BJP clearly doesn't want any violence with POTUS doing a state visit. 
It's either the opposition or violent Muslim mobs. 

Stop spreading misinformation. The police are doing everything they can to control the violence.

I want to start building a customer base in India first because I have worked with a lot of Indian children here in Australia and I always have a very positive relationship with them and their families. I also feel that our countries have a good friendship!

&#x200B;

Anyway, my product is digital and subscription based and I'm trying to work out the best way to promote it to parents and schools in India. I'll keep it as vague as possible so it doesn't come across like a promotion here, but I haven't been able to find reliable answers to some questions in my research:  


1. Is 400 Rs per month a reasonable price for an online subscription? I want to make it affordable for as many families as possible.
2. What are the most effective forms of advertising to reach parents? I'm on a limited budget and putting a lot of my time into my products, so I want to make sure I'm choosing the right advertising channels.

Thank you all so much for reading my post and any insight you can offer :)"," It really depends on who your target audience is. Generally, the ones who prefer online education are tech-savvy, urban people and they should be able to shell out 400 rupees a month. But they'll probably form a minority, compared to the total number of students in India. Most of Indian students are in mid-sized to small towns, where 400 rupees is a big amount and parents would think twice before spending. [To give you an anecdote about spending, Spotify gives student memberships at 60 rupees a month, and all my urban friends think it's a really good deal, while a lot of my small town friends still prefer to pirate it for free.]


But at the same time if the product is worth it, Indian parents are a sucker for anything education related. But you'll have to work hard to establish that trust.  You can have a look at BYJU's - they do a lot of teaching online and they've gotten loads of funding.

Edit: I worked for a couple of years, volunteering and teaching kids mathematics and English. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask. [deleted] Ask the parents of the children in Australia.

Much more profitable. What specifically your subscription offers? Sounds interesting!

I would like to get involved. Could trade in some awareness and skill for involvement. Sounds good?"

563,Business/Finance,I can't get over Shaktikanta Das being appointed as RBI Governor,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a5ewag/i_cant_get_over_shaktikanta_das_being_appointed/,"I flaired this as Business/Finance. I guess it should be Politics and Non Politics as well.

IAS officers generally have no technical knowledge of the area they lead. Now from RR, we have gone down to the level of this guy who raped us with his demo execution.

Now, does this guy have any formal education in finance and economics? I couldn't find out. Or are we just following 'hard work > Harvard' bull shit.

What really worries me is that common people, or even educated people, or even the randia crowd don't seem to realize how serious and fucked up this could be. We just don't have daily interaction with the RBI, so most don't know or care. RBI policies and actions affect everything. And I mean everything! As if demo isn't a good example of that."," It's very simple.

The only reason Urjit Patel, who offered no resistance to the government's draconian demonetisation move, flipped out when the government asked the RBI to loosen its reserves is even he realises how dangerous a move this is.

Jaitley is out there behaving like an ignorant child saying the RBI has 3 lakh crores of ""surplus"" when in actuality, it's ""reserves"". No one knows when the economy will go haywire.

The world's best economists didn't see the 2008 disaster coming. So these reserves are just that. Reserves!

And since Urjit didn't bend, the government kicked him out. You think this was a resignation? No, it was a firing that was timed to perfection.

The replacement was announced on election result day so it gets burried in the election news.

Mr. Das with his master's in history will offer nothing but support to the government's ideas.

Modi wants the reserves to come out, creating a temporary surge in growth. He will also announce a lot of people friendly schemes in run up the the 2019 Elections.

If these things happen, he truly will have fucked up the economy. I'm buying lube and preparing my anus. Demo 2.0 is right around the corner They got Das for one simple reason. For the ~~1 lakh~~ 3 lakh crore that Jaitley and gang are eyeing. 

The request for that money to be given from RBI reserve, will come in a week or two. 

In a month, there’ll be more loans being dolled out by banks, more mudi kaka posters, more photo ops, more statues of mudi kaka himself if possible and Ofcourse, for ram mandir. 

These people will leave the country in ashes.  I have one request from all of you(people who understand beyond Mandir-Masjid, BJP-Cong). Start educating people on our parliamentary system about MLAs MPs start with your friends, your domestic help tell them how it is done, counsel them(not on which party to vote for but how it affects them). 

Let's start something from our side to save whatever we have left! [deleted] >What really worries me is that common people, or even educated people, or even the randia crowd don't seem to realize how serious and fucked up this could be. 

I hope the opposition takes to the social media and tells us what these people are up to. Most of us have a bare minimum education in matters of economics.  [removed] He's got a history degree and has no idea about the economics. He's a government yes man,a puppet.

The government wants to take a huge risk and damage the countries financial stability,in return for short term gains.

The movement of wealth from cash to bonds shows that this is just too risky Dude is MA History.  All his predecessors have been PhD in Economics and Banking.  He is just a Jately lapdog.   [deleted] A reminder to everyone.  RBI asked PayTM to remove the CEO of Paytm payment bank because she did not have any banking experience. And now Jately ji has brought in a no banking experience/no economist(MA History) to head RBI. They think we are retarded. 

And to reply to another comment, these sarkari training certificates have no weight what so ever. I did an MBA from one of these Indian Institute tags and we train many a sarkari afsars usually IAS,IRS and IFS. They just have to attend a few sessions and they get the certificate. Getting a PhD from Yale or Harvard or MIT involves original research work. 

And on top of everything this dude implemented demonetisation.  No economist worth their salt would have let this happen.  I'm not worried if some person without some academic background gets appointed as the Governor of RBI as long as his actions are carefully considered and sane. Also, as other commenter pointed out, it's the board members who make the decisions collectively and we have experts from different fields of study in the board.

With all that said, it's still a very bad decision made by the government. I mean, it's not unexpected that they chose someone who supported the DeMon to the core despite its serious flaws. Also, his politically conservative attitude which he fearlessly displayed in the past is something that's troubling regarding his appointment. I'm supportive of people with very little or no academic background but with sufficient experience working in different related fields of relevance making it into key positions in apex level organizations but this man is clearly chosen with a different motive in mind.

As for the boards and its members being key decisions makers in the organization, I won't be surprised if they're to replaced with other like minded experts as our newly appointed governor if the present members show any kind of disappointment in the decision taking. No organization is devoid of factions but what we've seen till now is that these apex organizations were given a significant freedom to operate on those level of factions that were divided on academic grounds which is undeniably a healthy division. But the recent divisions that developed within the organization are toxic to this organization and thereby to the country as a whole because the core ideology is that of political, rather than being an economic or social one.

This appointment is very much like the appointment of Betsy DeVos as US secretary of education or Kavanaugh's appointment to the US Supreme Court. Abuse of power and unhealthy political involvement in matters that are unrelated. Let's see how this will unfold in times to come.  To me, it matters less what his academic or research credentials are. A lot of people with less formal credentials can do good jobs. What matters more is that he is a Government stooge. Totally agree with you. Mr Das has corruption allegations against him as well.  Pre 2014 RBI was eyeing implementation of basel norms, and now RBI itself is getting its ""pillars"" stripped 😑 He was mouthpiece of government during demo. It's election time and government will try everything possible to remain in power.

RBI reserves will be used as election funds. Loan wievers, ect . Will there be any announcements or news once he hands over a part of the reserve to Mudi Kaka and Blog minister?  I dunno but I get the hunch that even this guy will not be able to tolerate the PM and his gang's nonsense and he will also leave.. Generally (historically) how much time the previous governments taken to decide on the next governer? Daru will help to get over someone 😂 Nothing surprising saar. Inmates running the asylum is trademark of bjp Guys, he's an alumnus of IPE and has a masters in finance from there it seems. Just saying, not stating he's the guy for the job at all, cause he's not. ITT posters citing Wikipedia as source for Shaktikanta Das's qualifications. SMH vigorously.  tax payers are fcuked Why do you bring the rape analogy here! \>   Or are we just following 'hard work > Harvard' bull shit. 

I definitely do not agree with this. The Harvard passouts I have personally met so far have been bitter disappointments. Mostly because expectations from such people are high but also they are usually not experts in their fields or really intend to be. I dont have enough knowledge to say whether this is a good thing or not, But atleast his wikipedia page seem to indicate that he has done schooling in Finance in IIMB and National Institute of Banking Management. He also had held posts in various government revenue organizations.  Not sure, if these are good enough but i dont think they just appointed a guy with just MA History degree as RBI governor. He seems to have some relevant qualification and experience. He has experience in economics related field. PhD in economics doesn't means that you should be selected. Even Raghuram  pursued IIT and later did MBA. Did he had an economic background from the start? No.

This guy might not be the best option but let the guy even work. I know he is a puppet of the government but give some time at least. Turns out he does have a background in finance and management education as suggested by his Wikipedia page To be fair, RBI is supposed to serve the government. If urjit wasn't doing what the government was asking then they have the right to replace him. Because we will blame the government for poor economic policies and vote them out, not the RBI. "
564,Business/Finance,"“India is not, as people keep calling it, an underdeveloped country, but rather, in the context of its history and cultural heritage, a highly developed one in an advanced state of decay.”",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d931fb/india_is_not_as_people_keep_calling_it_an/,"*At the outset, I would like to state that this is not an essay that is critical of India or its people in any way. I am merely stating what I have observed and what I have concluded based on these observations. For this is the unvarnished truth. And India cannot palate the truth.*

My personal example on the reluctance to work hard: it is not just that, we lack ethics and morals too.

I know I am going to ruffle a few feathers as there are a lot of people from the US here. I am a grad student in the US(working towards my Ph.D), and most of friends here in the US are working in IT related jobs. What is worrying is that most of he these people got the jobs through consultants, who fake everything thing - from fake resumes to even fake phone interviews. I mean these are 22-23 YO with an experience of 8 years. I agree that the companies don't care much about contracts jobs, but the people who work should have a sense of responsibility. 80% of my undergrad friends are working in this manner. Their defence is that 'we spend so much money on education, it is only fair to earn and this is the easiest way we can earn good money.""

I never intrude into others' personal decisions, but this is really bothering me. We buy the newest Japanese and Germany cars in a flash, yet pirate songs and movies. We bitch about the state of politics, yet we behave the same way.. even worse in some cases that public servants.

We lack even the basic of ethics, we litter everywhere, drive like lunatics(we can't even give way to ambulances) and are pretty inconsiderate of others overall. More than my disdain for politics, I am pretty annoyed by the behavior normal people.

I am not saying that I am a perfect person, at least I am being honest to myself and even though I am being paid peanuts and under a lot of pressure from my parents, I am enjoying my student life. I am just sad that many people don't have and share good values. 

The Indian brain, is a phrase I have been hearing since I was a kid. Having been a PhD candidate, and seeing how India's best and brightest compared to the world's was an eye-opener for me. Sure my fellow Indians too won best paper awards and fellowships, but the average of originality & creativity was far higher in some of our Western counterparts.

The difference becomes even more stark, when one compares the contributions and achievements of Ashkenazi Jews (American or Israeli) to those of Indians. A persecuted minority of a few millions have contributed many orders more when compared to India's privileged academic contributors- say Tamil Brahmins. Of course it is worse when compared to Indians as a whole. What is striking is that the difference holds true even when comparing in a different field like business/ finance and contrasting with Gujrati/ Marwaris.

I am not exactly a self-hating Indian, and am moderately proud of Indian achievement when compared to some of our neighbors. But that is where it unfortunately ends.

I recently moved southwards in the Bay Area- from Palo Alto/ Mountain View to Santa Clara/ San Jose. I dropped out of my PhD and now run a moderately successful startup with some burn rate, and wanted to save some dough as we are in the process of raising money. And my new residence[1] almost wants me to start hating Indians. The Indian food is far better here, but most Indians seem to be of the variety you describe- consultancy or menial tech jobs. They are clannish, semi-dumb and almost seem to be proud of their mediocrity. FML & I can't wait to move to SF.

[1] for those who are not aware, these areas are far more Indian populated. Though I have seen seen something similar when I visited a friend in New Jersey.


Socrates, the father of Western thought, often spoke of a concept called Thumos. Thumos was very much a Greek concept. An abstract concept that held many meanings and translations. However, this concept has been lost to humanity and no literal translation exists in English. The essence of ‘Thumos’ can probably be summed up by the saying – “When making a decision, a man is faced with two choices. An easy path and a tough path. The easy path leads to barbarism. The tough to civilization"". And it is this tough road that every society must traverse to reach a peak. Taking the tougher road is an informed decision, for the natural impulse of every man is to take the easy path. He has to consciously take the tougher path, and avoid the easy. However, a man might unknowingly go down the easy path and end up where he did not want to be. Retracing your steps back to the tougher path is often a thankless and sometimes nigh on impossible task. Most men do not make it. India too, is at this cross roads today. And we might not make it.

It is indeed, ironic then, that I started this essay about the decline of ‘Indian civilization’ with a concept borrowed from the West. This is not to show that Indian philosophy has not reached the high levels of thought to have such a concept, but to merely show how far we have strayed from it. Make no such mistake. For the Vedas, the ultimate repository of Indian philosophy, were written long, long before Socrates’ ancestors even took up the plough and decided to grow the weeds they had observed in the wild and gave them nourishment. We had reached unimaginable highs and fallen from those highs, long before Socrates even had his first coherent thought. All Socrates did then, was re-discover what we had already known. We were superior in all respects. And it is in this very attitude, that lies the seed of our destruction. How many times have you heard your elders say – “Indian culture is the best. Anything associated with the West is bad!”. I hear it all the time. It is a constant din in our ears. Anything associated with the West is decadent and immoral and inferior. And Indian culture is superior to every other culture, past, present and future. Well then, superior in exactly what manner?? Few, if any, gave a concrete answer to this question. If they gave an answer at all.

The most common response to my question was anger and a rebuke for asking too many questions. How then are we superior? IF we are superior at all? Let us look around the world today and ask ourselves, “How many of the concepts, ideas, and objects that I use in my daily life on a day-to-day basis emerged from purely indigenous sources?” I asked myself this question many times, over and over again. The conclusion was the same everytime. None. To further clarify this point, let us look at the last invention of consequence which had a purely Oriental origin. Gunpowder. And this too was taken up and advanced by the West. If the Chinese invented Gunpowder, it was the West that developed the cannons that used them. Indeed, there is nothing that we can call truly our own except the past. And as all of us have seen, we revere the past. It is drummed into us in our schools, in our universities, in our families and at the dinner table. Indian culture always was and is, miles ahead of the decadent and corrupt influences of the West. It is not. This assertion is nothing but an inferiority complex. And an aversion to the truth.

It is important to realize that I am not saying that India or Indian culture is inferior or all that we developed as a civilization is a fabrication. It is not a fabrication. We were indeed a highly advanced civilization, and a highly cultured one at that. But we were, and not are. What we are now is a mish mash of cultures that does not know where it is headed.

How did we then fall so low? How did we, we who had reached highs that even now are only dreamt of, fall to the very depths from where these highs are unimaginable? It is tempting to blame the West, colonialism, British rule and all that. But the problem lies much deeper than that.

Every empire is built on one strength. One strength that sets it apart from the neighbours and allows it to grow while others around it stagnate. The Roman empire was built on the discipline of its Legions. Most armies of that time were little more than unruly mobs and this proverbial discipline of the Roman Legion made it a formidable attacking force. The British Empire was built on the strength of the trade links between Britain, a small insignificant island, and its vast territorial holdings in every corner of this planet. The dominant empire today is the USA. This empire is a little different. For its strength stems from its culture. Right from Hollywood, to sitcoms, our thought processes and ideas, to even what we eat and wear, it is the cultural power of the USA in full show. Every empire in history has had its one strength. And India too had a cultural empire similar to what the USA has today. A thousand years ago, students flocked from all over the world to study at Nalanda and Taxila. Just as they flock to the USA today. Great ideas were born in this crucible of free thought. Religions, philosophies and sciences were established by enlightened souls. Just as they are being established in the USA today. However, all empires must fall. The Roman empire fell when the discipline of its legions eroded. The British empire fell when its trade links could no longer be kept captive to serve them alone. The cultural empire of the USA is ripe to fall even as I write this. And the Indian empire has already fallen. A thousand years ago India was the USA of the age. Not any more. Today this cultural empire has eroded until all we have left is a kind of cultural hubris. And hubris, as we all know, is a fine quality. Often found in those who perish from it.

The strength of Indian civilization was always in its openness to new ideas. And a willingness to put in the hard work to further those ideas. Today however, we have neither the openness to new ideas, nor the will to work hard. Take for example the resistance to ‘Westernization’. Does it not speak of a reluctance to embrace new ideas and concepts? This hardening of opinions and closing of minds is prevalent not only in resisting outside influences and ‘preserving Indian culture’, but also in every detail of our lives. A teacher in India does not like it if his student questions him. For in that question, lies the seed of a new idea. And in that seed, lies the implication that the teacher may be wrong. And that is why we Indians do not like someone who asks too many questions, as I found out to my cost when I questioned India’s supposed cultural superiority.

**A far more dangerous symptom however, is our instinctive reluctance to work hard for what we want. Our instinctive impulse to take a shortcut. Our instinctive reflex to take the easy road. Here I come back to the opening statement of this essay. “The easy path leads to barbarism. The tough to civilization”. The tough road is often a tedious path. And in India, this road is often avoided in favour of the easy. Jugaad. It is nothing but a shortcut. And we as a nation, nay, as a civilization have become addicted to shortcuts. And hence we have fallen. Everything in India can be resolved by a shortcut. If you stand in a queue, there is always a tout who will be happy to help you jump the line for a fee. Instead of paying your taxes, it is far easier to just hide your income under your bed. Why wait for the light to change from red to green when there is no one crossing your path? Why be orderly when you can be disorderly and get away with it? Why work hard when you can steal from someone? Why be polite when you do not have to be? Why throw the garbage into the dustbin when someone is there to collect it from any spot in the city? I could go on and on. Everything in India has a shortcut. And this culture of taking shortcuts has struck root in the very mindset of our society. Every single thing is now a shortcut. Jugaad. Why take the tougher road to civilization? Why apply our minds when someone else can do it? It is easier to run away to the West than stay back and make this country worth living in. Why perform original research in India where you have to build your own apparatus, when you can just hop across the pond and perform that same research in the West, where that same apparatus can be bought off the shelf? Why? Why indeed? Because, it is the short cut. It is the easy path. And it shall lead us to barbarism. It is not an individual failing on the part of Indians. I will not blame any one person for this. It is a failing of our society. Indeed, it is a historical inevitability.**

Historical inevitability? Yes, our decline was inevitable. Every great civilization has declined when its culture of openness is replaced by closed minds and an aversion to questions. Look at Islam a thousand year ago and today. If at all anyone dares to interpret the quoran any way other than the accepted dogma, he is immediately met with a fatwa calling for his beheading. Western civilization has flourished and prospered precisely because it has cast off the yoke that is the Catholic church and allowed free thought. This freedom of thought does remain in India, but only in vestiges. And as we have already seen, it is being gradually eroded. It is historical inevitability. The point is further clarified by a study of entropy. Entropy, in layman’s terms, is a measure of the disorderliness in a system. In any spontaneous process, Entropy always increases. So if we consider human history to be a spontaneous process, interspersed by periods where Man has consciously tried to improve himself, it is not difficult to see how every rise is followed by a fall. As I have already stated, taking the tougher road is an informed decision, while the easy path comes spontaneously. Every civilization at some point, will abandon the long tough road, to take the short cut. And when a society starts taking shortcuts, it begins to decline. Every civilization has declined and so shall we.

And so we have declined. Our fall has only begun. And we shall keep falling, for a long, long time. Is there nothing that can be done? I do not know. The only thing that can be done is the administration of a shock treatment. A shock treatment that so drastically affects us that we will be forced to change for the better. The Black Death in the 14th century jolted Europe and gave rise to the Renaissance, which laid the foundation for the current dominance of Western civilization. Kemal Mustafa Ataturk’s radical measures of Westernization and his suppression of anything connected with the decadence of the Ottoman empire, gave rise to Modern Turkey. A nation that is a beacon of hope for the Muslim world. What kind of shock treatment can reverse the tide of India’s decline? I do not know. But the least we can do, is acknowledge that we have a problem. And when you see the problem and the scale of it, it will give you the shock treatment.

**TL;DR - We are in decline because our culture has lost its ability to question and innovate. We also prefer shortcuts. It is a historical inevitability and there is nothing we can do about it.**",

568,Business/Finance,"Delhi has not been given a single paisa from the ₹17,000 crore allocated to states. Here's why",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fv9ifd/delhi_has_not_been_given_a_single_paisa_from_the/,"Hi there!

As is being reported by the news, approximately ₹17,000 crore has been allocated by the Centre to the States. Here is a representative news report: [""Centre grants Rs 17,000cr to states to tackle coronavirus crisis"", Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/centre-grants-rs-17000cr-to-states-to-tackle-coronavirus-crisis/articleshow/74975956.cms)

Of this ₹17,000 crore, ₹11,092 crore is the Union's contribution to the ""State Disaster Response Mitigation Funds (SDRMFs)"" and the rest is as a ""Revenue Deficit Grant"".

**Tl;dr:** The short answer on why Delhi didn't see a single paisa of this money is because the Fifteenth Finance Commission (XV-FC) has not included Delhi in its recommendations. This is because Delhi is not a state. The Finance Commission, a constitutional body, deals with financial relations between the Union Government and State Governments.

**Deep Dive:**

The XV-FC recommended creation of a new “disaster mitigation and response fund” 💰 at Union (NDRMF) and State levels (SDRMFs).

These new funds are distinct from the O.G. 😎 'National Disaster Response Fund' (NDRF) and SDRFs under the Disaster Management Act, 2005. The NDRF and SRDFs are for ""*meeting expenses for emergency response, relief, and rehabilitation due to any threatening disaster situation or disaster.*”

The NDRMF and SDRMF are for *""local level and community-based interventions which reduce risks and promote environmentally-friendly settlements and livelihood practices.*"" Large scale mitigation will continue to be addressed by broad developmental programs and policies of the Union and State Governments.

*Note 1*: The difference here lies in the words **response** (NDRF/SDRF) and **mitigation** (NDRMF/SDRMF). Mitigation is pre-disaster. Mitigation actions reduce or eliminate the loss of life and property by lessening the impact of disasters.

*Note 2*: The NDRMF/SDRMF are statutory (legal) funds under the Disaster Management act, 2005 📝. Just like the NDRF and SDRFs.

*Note 3*: the Supreme Court 👨‍⚖ , in 2016, in an act of judicial activism (🙄) directed the creation of a National Disaster Mitigation Fund (NDMF) and state SDMFs. This was criticized a lot cause the court’s got no business in the executive 💼 working. This direction was not followed by most governments in India, and has remained a non-starter 🚫

Similarly, the approximately ₹6000 crore of Revenue-Deficit Grants are only for state governments.

**Edit and Update:** It seems that an inherent fact is being overlooked by people in the comments. The Union’s devolution under the XV-FC’s recommendations is a *constitutional obligation* and was meant to happen regardless of the Coronavirus epidemic. It also seems that people are (rightly so) peeved at red-tape because effectively the Government of Delhi does not get funds to combat this crisis. Some possible financing mechanisms that I’ve elaborated in the comments section are:

* Further Union contributions to Delhi’s SDRF (most effective)
* Making funds available from the Union Home Affairs Ministry (improbable given constrained budgets)
* Ways and Means Advances from RBI (30 day credit limit)
* Union spending through New Delhi Municipal Corporation (limited geographical spread)
* Municipal Bonds (underdeveloped and tight credit)
* Allocations from PMNRF and PM-CARES
* Donation drives from citizens and civil society"," I would especially like to emphasize page 99 onwards where the methodology for calculating state share of SDRMF is given. Some people were complaining that why Kerala has been allocated so less amount compared to Maharashtra. There were several speculations and baseless theories (eg- north-south discrimination) but none of the critical comments, in my knowledge, mentioned about the finance commission recommendations, which is the actual reason. None of them bothered to critique the recommendations.

I think this post provides a good chance to the people to critique the methodology adopted by XV-FC in allocation of state share of SDRMF funds. People critical of distribution of funds to various states can read page 99 onwards. This will help them base their criticism on actual facts, rather than their imagination. You can give all the justification and 'due process' you want. We all know the *real* reason why Delhi got 0. >The short answer on why Delhi didn't see a single paisa of this money is  because the Fifteenth Finance Commission (XV-FC) has not included Delhi  in its recommendations. This is because Delhi is not a state.

Yes so Delhi must get money then directly from centres funds right? like NDRF or the PM relief fund. I'm sure we have lots of funds for unforseen circumstances which have funds but can be used for this emergency especially with Delhi becoming an epicentre after the tablighi fiasco Leave all technicalities. Can someone tell me how is Delhi supposed to operate without this fund? Basically the question is why were these alternate mechanisms not used? Great post u/ringtring. Kejriwal has been moaning about not receiving funding to combat the crisis and this is a great post explaining why Delhi was not allocated funds.

Either Kejriwal does not know the reason (mentioned in the post) or is willingly not mentioning it to create a sense of bias against AAP by the centre. Either way, he needs to get his facts right. Nice research with Finance commission recommendations.

But the recommendations of the FC is ADVISORY and hence NOT BINDING on the govt. . So nothing like constitutional obligations. 

Also PM Cares has a lot of fund now so it can be used straight away ... so I feel the ball is in Central govt. court now to get funds for Delhi and put the end to this issue and not politicise by playing around. I think Kejriwal is all in his rights to ask for funds.

http://www.arthapedia.in/index.php?title=Finance_commission This just sounds like bullshit based on limited understanding on so many levels. Let me tell you a few reasons why this simply cannot be true:

1) Let's say the disaster was limited to Delhi. Would they still give money to everyone - all states but Delhi? Of course not, they would have given money only to Delhi in that case. It's truly absurd to think that the centre is restricted from handing out funds to Delhi government in case of an emergency.

2) The money may not come out of SDMF but could come out of any number of places including but definitely not limited to the PMNRF or PM CARES fund. If you are saying that it is simply not possible for centre to hand out money to Delhi government to deal with COVID-19, that's simply absurd.

3) Delhi is going to get money sooner or later of this doesn't get better. It's only a matter of time. And the question would be why were they not given the money sooner, like the other states. 

4) At the end of the day what matters is that money that comes to the Delhi government, not the  route that it follows. It's a job of the centre to figure out the route and they are definitely not ""helpless"" in not giving money to Delhi. If they wanted to, Delhi would have had the money by now. What nonsense. Let me get the timeline straight.

BJP 2014: Elect us Delhi, we will give you statehood.

BJP 2015: Elect us Delhi, we will give you statehood.

AAP 2015-2019: Give us statehood.

BJP: No.

AAP 2020: Give us money for tackling a pandemic like every other state.

BJP: Sorry, you are not a state.

Fuck off! We are going through a freaking pandemic right now....To hell with all the bureaucracy and politics about delhi not being a state..we all know the real reason why delhi didnt receive aid. Thanks for research. So it is more like. We will make sure everyone suffers as we did not win the election? Your accusation of judicial activism is severely misplaced.

> It also seems that people are (rightly so) peeved at red-tape because effectively the Government of Delhi does not get funds to combat this crisis

I wonder why the SC saw issues with how it has been setup.

The job of SC is to make sure than every citizen of the union gets treated equally. It is also to reign in on power excesses. The executive branch is already the most powerful branch of the three and we need SC to balance the structure. Do we know how much of that money did they allocate to each state?"
569,Business/Finance,ITS LOCK ON for Indian Real Estate,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fxmvof/its_lock_on_for_indian_real_estate/,"  

***LOCK – ON means 'Disambiguation' which refers to the removal of ambiguity by making something clear.***

We never would’ve imagined a day when 1/3rd of world’s population would be in a lockdown. While the wrath of the lockdown has totally changed our lives, putting our work and finances in a jeopardy, our future will depend largely on how we utilize the time available today. The lockdown gives us ample of time to ponder upon key decisions taken and to be taken, explore avenues for reviving the finances, make mindful investments and rectify the unpreparedness with which we are facing today’s situation. Make a choice now, whether you want to repent over what went wrong or make lemonade out of the lemons life (or the virus) has thrown upon us. If you choose the latter, then this article is for you to read ahead. 

This pandemic has rightly taught us that **uncertainties come unexpectedly.** How prepared are we to face an adverse situation again?

Businesses are adversely hit and job security has gone for a toss, leaving us in a catch 20 situation. Talking about investments, the FDs, Stocks, shares that we invested in are witnessing negative returns. Our priced possessions like jewelry and gold are locked up in banks and not helping us get through the situation. Fancy cars are stationed in parking lots, unused. The alternate investment options like SIPs, Mutual Funds too aren’t performing. 

Remarkably, **one thing that has stood between us and the disaster is HOME**. A sense of safety and security that a home brings for a family is irreplaceable. It is a physical as well as an emotional comfort zone where one heals and recuperates through tough times. Man, right from the stone age has been wandering in search of a home (caves), to protect himself, establish a family, dwell in and flourish. 

A critical question arising out of the Covid19 scenario is **what will be the fate of home buying and Real Estate post the lockdown?**

Studies and reports suggest that the real estate sector will decline; witnessing the worst hit till date and survival will be a challenge. However, as said by Benjamin Franklin, “Out of Adversity comes Opportunity”. The sector also flashes rays of positivity and you would be intrigued to know about the potential to INVEST in Real Estate, against all the current odds. 

Real Estate will be the most reliable investment option, considering the conditions of banks, share market crash and capital depreciation or any other option that may appear to be safe initially.

**Why will the Indian Real Estate sector grow faster than that of the world?**

1. The world economy will go into recession this year with a predicted loss of trillions of dollars of global income due to the coronavirus pandemic, spelling serious trouble for developing countries, with the likely exception of India and China, according to a latest UN trade report.

2. The virus pushes U.S.-Chinese relationship towards fracture; the fallout from the global pandemic threatens the recent U.S.-Chinese trade deal and could undermine future global stability. This rift will lead India to gain interests of global investors and companies. These investments open doors for better infrastructure, leading to the opening of multiple employment opportunities. These factors directly balm the upward movement of real estate in India.

3. China lost its goodwill and trust from investors and the corporate world, owing to the   
 (rumored) conspiracies in the way the country handled the spread of COVID 19 to the world. After China, India is the only country with the capacity to handle the magnitude of the Global scale, in terms of manpower, resources, transport systems, etc.

4. India so far, has augmented trust in handling corona and has bravely fought pandemics in the past too. Indian Real Estate gains appreciation form world economists for its perception as a Nation full of values and ethics, leading India with great avenues to become a Global Superpower.

5. NRI investment in real estate is bound to improve amidst Rupee fall.

While the above conditions make India a lucrative hotspot of real estate investments, below are few points to consider towards real estate buying: 

 **Emotional Investment**: In India, owning a home is a matter of pride and esteem. The sentiment runs around passing the home possession as a heritage from parents to the future generations. Interestingly, after our first name, ‘Home’ is second most used Word in the world every day. Ultimately, whatever be the circumstances people across the World will not stop investing in a home or buying real estate. 

**Statistics:** The Indian Real estate growth trajectory, since the past few years was likely to emerge stronger and is projected to be USD 650 Bn by 2025 and USD 1,000 Bn by 2030. Residential, commercial and Retail are the three key asset classes, which have primarily been contributing to the sector’s growth. Real estate contributed nearly 6% to India’s GDP in 2017. As per the projected growth trends, the sector’s contribution is likely to rise to 13% of India’s GDP by 2025.

· **Real Estate – Largest Employment Generator:** After agriculture, Real estate is the largest employment generator in the country, creating tremendous opportunities for the skilled and unskilled workforce. **India’s Real Estate employee base is estimated to be 67 Mn by 2022.**

· **High Tangible Asset Value:** Real estate is not paper money, this is the asset you can hold tangibly which again increases its reliability and return on investment.

· **Competitive Risk- Adjustment Returns :** Based on July 2018 data from National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries **(NCREIF),** private market **Commercial Real Estate returned** an **average of 9.85% over the past five years.** This credible performance was achieved, together with low volatility relative to equities and bonds, for highly competitive risk-adjustment returns. 

· **Attractive and Stable Income Return (Specially in Commercial space):** The **rental yield from real estate is much higher than returns on any traditional sources of investment**. Commercial investment can yield upto 12% ROI and lowest to 5% ROI (with capital appreciation) depending upon the construction stage and lease terms of the property.

· **Inflation Hedging:** The inflation hedging capability of real estate stems from the positive relationship between GDP growth and demand for real estate. As economies expand, the demand for real estate derives rents higher and this, in turn, translates into higher capital values.

· **Long Term “Assured” Wealth Building Asset with “Predictable “ Returns and least Risk** :- Real Estate helps you build wealth in long term due to dual advantage of Regular **“Predictable” Returns (yield is higher than Dividend Returns) and an “Assured” Capital Appreciation in long term**, don’t be scared of Corporate Scams, while they can affect the company’s stock price or your bank’s health, but it cannot junk out the value of real estate you own 

· **“Helps you Raise Money Quickly”** \- **Hard Asset is the most preferred collateral for a Bank**, to raise capital through a loan (LAP/LRD) your property is the best asset you could own!

· **The Ever Rising FSI Benefit** \- **“Wine and Real Estate improve with Age”** \- While as per accounting standards real estate is not a depreciating asset, in practical life too an older development can reap benefits of redevelopment wherein due to ever increasing FSI norms of MMR the incoming developer would not only offer rent for transit accommodation and corpus as hardship allowance, but also offer at least 25% to 30% enhanced Area (which is of great value as remember, 1 sq.ft of Real Estate in Central Mumbai is valued more than 10 gram of gold) !!

· **Work from Home Culture:** We are in the middle of the largest test of home-working in history and corporates are adopting, refining and testing policies, processes and infrastructure to make it work. We expect quarantine protocols to encourage work-from-home initiatives and for these practices to be adopted in new geographies as the contagion spreads. Large multinationals who recently, and publicly, announced the scaling back of home-working practices now indicate a desire to embrace widespread use of this practice until the outbreak passes. So commercial demands and co-working space or bigger house may increase.

· **Student Housing:** An unusual market development that is gradually emerging is student housing in India. Real estate consultancy firm, Anarock Property Consultants says that of the 37 million students pursuing higher education in India, more than 75% live away from home. Existing hostel facilities can accommodate only 18%-20% of this migrant student population. Developers in Mumbai & Pune have already ventured into this space that offers 7% returns.

· **Co-living market** size across India’s top 30 cities is expected to grow more than double by 2025 to $13.92 billion from current $ 6.67 billion. The demand for co-living in terms of beds is slated to grow to 5.7 million from 4.19 million, while the share of private beds is likely to rise from 15% to 30% of total demand in the co-living segment, showed a Cushman & Wakefield India report.

· **REITs are a great investment avenue** not only for institutional investors but also for retail investors, who find it difficult to invest in the commercial real estate, which has a better rent yielding than residential properties. Unlike other equity investments, REITs provide assured returns to the investors through a compulsory dividend distribution policy. REITs are mandated to distribute 90% of their net distributable income as dividend. There is also a further upside potential for the investors from periodic property valuations. India's first listed REIT, has gained 50% since listing in March 2019 as against a 10% gain in the Nifty Realty Index and 5% return of the benchmark Nifty 50.

· India’s improved rank on **Ease of Doing Business** and the courage to implement reforms such as DeMo, RERA, and IBC are indeed creditworthy. These are expected to yield fruitful results in the future and help establish Indian real estate as a preferred destination for global investors, occupiers, and homebuyers.

**WHY REAL ESTATE DURING LOCKDOWN?**

Probably most of the people interested in buying real estate would be holding their decision till the lock down opens due to speculations in the market or risk pertaining to economic conditions. Yet for any **clever investor who is observing the current market will testify buying of real estate during lock down to be the smartest move. Here is why –**

1. **Reduction in Home loan rates:** On 27 March 2020, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reduced the repo rate by 75 basis points (bps). The reduction saw the repo rate reduce from 5.15% to 4.40%. New home loan rates start at 8% from 1 March 2020. So indeed this is good time to buy your home if the decision was just hiding behind the corner for some better rates or good units.

2. **Low Demand – Value for Money:** Real estate is facing deficit demand in the market which leads to generation of various attractive offers by Developers. To maintain the good books, builders are currently offering very low rates, lucrative payment plans and additional offers resulting in lowering the cost of property. End-user can expect to buy a property as low as the launch price during this lock down.

3. **Reduction in Stamp Duty:** The Maharashtra government on March 6 announced that it is reducing stamp duty on properties by 1% for Mumbai, MMRDA Region and Pune for a period of two years.

4. **Passive Income:** Various small investment options are being introduced in the market starting as low as 5 lacs in real estate that too with a rental income. This is again an opportunity to create a separate asset class in your portfolio and start a source of passive income.

5. **Demand- Supply breakthrough:** Due to low demand, discounted rates on good inventories are available. But once the economic condition will start settling, the bargain will reduce and demand will also start floating upwards. The rates will not be as low as they are now during lock down.

6. **Segment Shift** : Earlier Lower middle class people used to buy 10 to 12 Lakh property. Now middle class will buy those as an investor and rent it out to lower middle income group. Similarly shift will take place on affordable segment likewise. Middle income group will emerge as new investor community.

7. **Strike the Iron when it is Hot:** We all must have heard this at least once. But it’s time to implement the strategy to gain extensive returns on the investment. Not only the rates are strikingly low, the return on investment that are being offered by some Developers is as high as 15-18%.

**Final Thoughts:** 

**Your Money is SAFE IN Indian Real Estate**

\- Regulator like MahaRERA leading the cause of timely justice, 

\- High Court Judiciary being extremely proactive and pro-consumer / investor, 

\- NCLT giving prompt hearings and orders favoring customer and financial institution and lastly 

\- The Supreme Court judgment re-affirms the rights of the homebuyers as financial creditors under the bankruptcy code.... 

Simply put, it means that homebuyers share equal rights of recovery in the developer's assets which are liquidated as part of the bankruptcy process

**The Bottom Line**

**Real Estate cannot be lost or stolen, nor can it be carried away, purchased with common sense, paid in full, and managed with reasonable care , IT IS ABOUT THE SAFEST INVESTMENT IN THE WORLD.**

Real estate is a distinct asset class that is simple to understand and can enhance the risk and return profile of an investor’s portfolio. On its own, real estate offers competitive risk-adjusted returns, with less principal-agent conflict and attractive income streams. Though ill-liquidity can be a concern for some investors, there are ways to gain exposure to real estate yet reduce ill-liquidity and even bring it on-par with that of traditional asset classes. Real Estate investing even on a small scale, remains a tried and true means of building an individual’s cash flow and wealth.

**“BUY Real Estate in areas where the Path EXISTS , AND Buy MORE Real Estate where there is no PATH, but YOU can Create Your OWN. Don’t WAIT to BUY Real Estate , BUY Real Estate and WAIT.**

Anarock Report March 2020, Varsha Rathore, Zricks.com, Pic Credits: Google stories and newspapers"," Okay. Cigarettes are 45 a piece here. Can't afford groceries if the lockdown goes on for another month. Sure, suggest us to buy cheap properties. Fucking real estate assholes. To a hammer,every problem looks like it can be fixed by a nail. Fact of the matter is real estate is a bad investment in India. You may buy a house if you wish to live in it. However as an investment vehicle with pitiful rental yields of 2-3% due to over supply in most cities, it is a renter's market.

Buying land on the outskirts where the city will grow into is a much better investment compared to buying built real estate. REAL ESTATE SHOULE BE THE LAST THING one should be investing in , in the next 12-15 months.

1. Rental yields from a rented home would barely be enough to cover the EMI of a housing loan ( let alone act as a secondary source of income ) 
I'm




2. Houses are highly illiquid investments. With the kind of job losses predicted over the next 12-15 months , one needs or have a solid savings pool to be easily accessible. If there are no takers for your house , you will have virtually no  liquidity on hand to provide for emergency expenditures ( mom and dad falling ill, deferred jobs for your sons and daughters , layoffs for you etc ) 



3. Post corona,  the reverse migration that has happened will not see most migrants returning any time soon. Most villages are self sufficient and labor migrates for better opportunities to cities. There will be  scant opportunities  post corona recovery and labour shortages will not be accompanied by commensurate wage increase as real estate firms will not be able to afford higher project outflows for labour. 

So expect massive delays on projects that are under construction . 


A large number of real estate firms will wind up. Quite a few will be stuck in litigation . You money may be stuck and you may never even see an asset. 


We are going through a highly irregular time. This is not a good time for such stupid investment decisions 

PSA : Stay away from this wall of text put up by OP !!!!! 

Real estate is the last thing a smart man should be looking at for the next 15-24 months. 

Park your savings in easily liquifiable and safe investments for the time being. ( FDs and savings accounts and maybe a few blue chip stocks ) 


PLEASE DO NOT INVEST IN REAL ESTATE. OP SEEMS TO BE SOME DOUCHE TRYING TO SELL SNAKE OIL BEHIND A WALL OF TEXT!!"
570,Business/Finance,Here's my side of the story as a small businessman,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fw7gcl/heres_my_side_of_the_story_as_a_small_businessman/,"This is going to be long. I would really appreciate it if you can read this fully. Thank you for your attention in advance. 

I'm not sure what to flair this post as. I'm on a throwaway account that I may or may not continue using and I just want to share my side of the story while I sit here in loneliness watching random videos on Youtube just to get my mind off of things. And with no sign of sleep at all.

>About me & my partners

I'm a late 20s guy who quit his job two years ago and went ahead and jumped into the Indian startup ecosystem to start my business. I'm also a college dropout by choice so I don't have a graduate degree but I really loved the business WE were running. Me along with two of the bestest friends were my partners and I feel responsible for them. One of them quit his safe cushy job when I messaged him at 2am in the morning with my idea and the other one trusted me enough to fund this whole machine. I'm extremely lucky to have these people in my life and I acknowledge that.

>Our Business - What we do

Our business isn't one of those apps or tech related business. We're more into the supply chain and making product sourcing and fulfillment for people in the ecommerce sphere easy. Think of it in a way that I'm sourcing and exporting products that my clients sell on their ecom sites. I loved this because this is something that solved a problem for my own hobby turning it into a full-fledged business and it was also helping me create a legit machine with a brand name that also helped me capture clients.

>How has the lockdown affected my business?

Being a new business we were ALMOST breakeven. Most of the money we were losing was because of bad decisions and mistakes but everyday we were losing less. Also had a bunch of profitable days and weeks which helped us not invest more from our own pockets into the business. We had created a cycle where the money that came in helped us with all the costs.

Me along with the partner who had invested money into the business were not taking out salaries (reason why I said almost breakeven) and I was making sure that the third partner got paid because he left his good job and to assure his family members - remember, we're all in our late 20s. We had also hired some help to help us in the office and with the vendors that we were dealing with. Basically the plan was to spend only when absolutely necessary and while doing it this way we also made sure that we had a life outside of work.

This worked smoothly with some hitches of course.

In January when I read about the first covid-19 case in India, I was scared. Things got bad real soon around the world. With every passing day I was worried more and more about what I was going to do in case our country went into a complete lockdown. I checked and tried to do some analysis in order to see if we can still work it if we do go into the lockdown.

But the fact of the matter is that my business heavily depends on vendors and shipping providers and the latter is out of my control and reach. The main part of this whole thing was shipping which I had taken so much pain to setup.

One thing I learned while doing all this is that there's a reason why India with such manpower and about mediocre infra in our industry isn't able to fulfill even a fraction of the demand. It's because the vendors are lazy. Even if you promise to pay them above the market rate, make payments on time and even help them financially to source the raw materials, they are not willing to work for it. And I'm not talking about overtime or anything.. Just their normal work cycle. They are not serious about it at all.

I had multiple vendors but only one of them worked properly and listened to me when there was an urgency in the order we were giving them. We had this second vendor who just wasn't serious about the work and we were giving them loads of work. Within a month I was their biggest client and they did work properly for the first two months but after that it all went to shit. I couldn't change my vendor because that's a long process of renegotiating and setting everything up which I couldn't do in my volumes which were high.

I wrote all this because when my city got the first few Covid-19 cases, I started urging them to get my work done as soon as possible. We were given assurances, promises, we paid in advance but it all went to shit because now I have an inventory of products that is ready to go but I cannot send them due to the state borders being closed. My shipping company is not able to function and all these need to be sent out of India.

I'm now in a sea of uncertainty where I have to pay my bills, pay my office rent, pay salaries with whatever I have in the business account right now.

>The finances

I'm not even worried about the money, I'm worried about the inventory I have, I'm worried about the payment disputes I need to deal with because these are all orders to be sent outside India. For every payment dispute I lose, I lose $15 extra. The money for the customer acquisition cost is already paid for. The money for the raw materials are to be paid and I'm refunding customers everyday. Losing that customer acquisition amount along with any margin that I might have earned.

>What do I mean exactly? 

Now, I'm all for Life>Money but as a small businessman who has been thinking, living, breathing his business all the time for months and years, I'm going insane. I'm having panic attacks, I don't know what I will do next. I used to have a plan for everything, now I don't. I'm not able to let this go and this pain is almost physical now. My head hurts all the time, I sleep for a few hours and when I wake up my eyes are still red and they feel as if they're burning.

I'm also sure that there are businesses out there that are into deeper shit than I am but that in my own opinion shouldn't be a comfort for me. I'm not sadistic.

I have no savings, my company is running out of money, there are people who need to be paid, employees to pay and a partner who invested with trust and is now seeing the money disappear into thin air daily - he's a kind soul and hasn't said a single word for it yet.

But I feel responsible and I'm not able to calm down. Anxiety is on its peak for me right now and I have no plans to save us from this.

I come to this sub daily and I actively participate in discussions and disses but I haven't seen anything about small business people here and just wanted to tell my side of the story.

I'm scared guys, I'm not even religious and can just hope that the govt. probably is thinking of exporters in this scenario to maybe help us in this situation.

I'm wishing you all good health and please stay inside.

I'm going to try and sleep now. Thank you for reading this."," i do hope you have a force majure clause in your fulfillment policy. this would protect you from any fall out as things aren't in your control. this is a unique situation where no one has control over anything, whether they are an employer or employee. also,  working with indian clients can be a pain in the arse as like you said, they don't pay enough attention to work; inefficiencies are high, there are leaks within the workflow process. the system is far from decent, let alone perfect. i feel it is a cultural thing more than anything else.

from one small bujiness man to another, let the dust settle. you cannot do anything now since nothing is in your control. talk to your vendors and customers. make sure there are sufficient open communication channels to ensure that they know your position and you know theirs. this would immensely help you to get back on your feet quicker once you're aware of the issues you'll have to deal with once things open up.

you also have a lot of free time since there's no activity. work on yourself and your company now. look inwards. take assessment of your processes, see where you can improve workflow, focus on efficiency. with not much happening in the world, this is an excellent time to introspect since we wouldn't get time otherwise when things are busy (without disrupting operations).

I would also use this time to contact vendors who are of the same wavelength as you. you're only as good as your team. if you're taking the extra step with your vendor to ensure your operations aren't affected, you're more likely helping him and not yourself. it isn't your job to make sure he does his so that you get what you're paying for.  use this free time to search and assess vendors who take their commitments seriously as much as you do. make some phone calls, talk to people and get a feel of their product orservices. you can also use this time to negotiate and do some ground level work. this would iron out all the problems you're facing with your current vendors once the lock down is over.

feel free to DM. i love to talk to fellow businessmen :) I don't have any advice that would help you. I just wanna say, be strong. This too shall pass! Stay in there buddy, you're young and that fire will bring you out. Whatever happens, don't quit, Difficult times bro! Stay Strong! A few questions:

1. Is your inventory perishable?
2. Can't it be sold domestically?
3. Not sure if this question is even correct - is it possible to go into a hibernation mode and then restart the business when things are better?
4. Are your customers in a position to wait for things to improve and accept delayed deliveries? You sound like a survivor, dude! You'll Noah this one out, pukka! Bro code says, you and your friends will be fine!"
571,Business/Finance,Actuarial student looking for some career advice.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fzsng3/actuarial_student_looking_for_some_career_advice/,"Hey there internet people!

I posted this in r/Indian_Academia but didn't get any responses. Posting here for better visibility. 

Sorry for a long post but I would really appreciate some career guidance.

I'm gonna give you a brief background of my situation. I graduated in 2016 with a BSc in Statistics, Mathematics and Economics (from Christ University Bangalore if it matters). During second year of college I really got into skateboarding and was desperately trying to make it work as a career option. I worked with Holystoked collective (they are the pioneers of skateboarding scene in India), built a skatepark in Bangalore with them and life was amazing. But towards the end of my undergrad I injured my knee pretty bad and things went downhill from there. One injury led to another and before I could realize, I had a knee issue, back pain, hip pain and what not. I was in poor health and it eventually took toll on my mental health. Long story short I pretty much wasted a little over one year. In 2017 I got my shit together and wrote the entrance test for writing actuarial exams. I started writing actuarial exams in 2018 and cleared 4 Core Technical exams by the end of 2019. I was going to write two more exams this April but our exams got cancelled due to COVID 19 pandemic.

Now, I've been looking for an actuarial job for some time now and realized that its really really hard to get a job without contacts or college placements. I have also been learning data sciece and machine learning with python, as I already have a solid maths and statistics foundation, so as to get a data science or data analyst job and then perhaps switch to actuarial eventually. But now with an almost inevitable economic recession looming over our heads, I'm a little worried about my career.

Could someone please guide me? Where do I go from here? Should I keep looking for jobs? Even if I do find a job I don't expect it to be more than 5LPA. Or should I go for higher education? Would an MBA in Finance or Business Analytics make sense?"," I said you, Do not test waters again and again specially at the time of your career start. I did this and almost wasted my 2 years and still don't know where to go forward to, I did my MBA in 2017 in marketing and IT field then I was doing job as a Business Development Executive for around 6 month, I don't know what but after that I fight for SSC for hard 2 years but I just appeared for once in that exam as the other one got postponed back in 2018.

Now, I totally dropped that Idea but meanwhile SSC prepration I do some freelance marketing pipeline models for businesses and small firms. I did Advertisement assesment job in between on contract. 

I was also a CA IPCC dropped out as I can still do Articleship but I didn't want to go to that domain now. 

Now, I planned to do Data Analyst and Data Science role as I've pretty good amount of Business, Commerce & Finance, Mathematics knowledge with Keen intrest on Technology and I'm pretty good in IT also with DBMS. 

So, Now I wanted to learn Python then Data Science or Analyst with some ML and AI on hand but luckily Covid 19 hits and all my savings for 6 months is going out slowly. In 2020 I'm going to be a Programmer of python for sure. 

Long para short, It's better to stick to one thing for long, yep sometimes it's hard to figure out which is going to be good but I learner that it's not good to be a perfectionist in each case. If the salary starts at 5L, I'll go for it. Money is not a concern in life. It should be the skills you have in hand and the knowledge & experience you have throughout your journey.

573,Business/Finance,Oil slump? India will rather play dumb by raising prices,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fiolca/oil_slump_india_will_rather_play_dumb_by_raising/,"https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/government-raises-excise-duty-on-petrol-diesel-by-rs-3-per-litre-2194742?pfrom=home-topstories

The taxes on Petrol and Diesel have grown by over 100% in the tenure of Modi government. While the other big economies are trying to ensure that they do not go in economic slump by easing their monetary policy, India is busy dampening consumer confidence.

This news closely follows another one where the Modi government fired Urjit PATEL for not financing 1.56L crores worth of government expenditure.

The markets are reeling heavily downwards under pressure due to C scare, and it is very likely that the investors will pull out their investments from higher risk based emerging economies. In a looming recession, the growth can flee and the institutional investors may pull out in hoards.

The Indian banks are failing and the modi government is further dampening the consumer confidence by raising taxes on staple like Petrol. The recent drop in oil prices was perfect opportunity for the government to announce a reduction. 

In the times needing economic rescue via freer monetary measures , the government has chosen to play out a decision lacking economic prudence."," They did the same thing in 2018, when crude oil prices fell, they increased taxes on petrol and diesel.

https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/policy/excise-duty-on-petrol-diesel-to-give-big-boost-to-centres-revenue-kitty/article22723716.ece

It worked out really well for them, centre got a big boost in revenue, and no one seemed to have noticed or cared (going by the resounding victory in the 2019 general election). Since the strategy worked so well before, of course they will try it again. Chutiye hain, they are only trying to help out their financiers, corporate donors. The corporate tax cut was the worst decision in the last 6 months IMHO. 

Modi's legacy will be filled with pakoda logic when people study history. He has the same place in history as Tuglak. [deleted] Bhai aur to koi income hai nahi, petrol se hi kuch kama lene do central aur state govt ko yes but you are antinational and no one listens to people like you because hindu khatre main I always support higher taxes and prices on oil. we need to reduce our dependence on that shit. in addition, i want that extra money to be  put into alternative energy like solar and electric vehicles and in fighting the impact of climate change"

Because of the increasing workload, I am looking to hire two or three freelance writers. Basically, you will be writing:

- News pieces

- Blogs

- Articles

- Social media posts

- Newsletters, etc


Currently, I am hiring writers for cryptocurrency, finance, business (B2B and B2C) and marketing niche. If you are a skilled wordsmith, but don't know how to craft compelling B2B articles, worry not, I will give you basic training. But for cryptocurrency-related projects, it's quintessential to have knowledge about the general crypto market, tokens, and blockchain technology. I prefer someone experienced, but it's not necessary if you know how to use words and grammar properly. If you know someone who fits these requirements, please let him/her pm me. 

Pay varies between Rs. 250 - 700 per article, depending on the niche and the length of the article. The rate will further go higher for long-form content.

No upper limit to how many posts you write. Payments made on a monthly basis.

Please fill [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf3KVC1pGt5iopHo1luUDX9EkgguYX8Qn3iqU7R-WhLj29jNg/viewform?usp=sf_link) to apply.

Thanks"," Hey buddy, just want to point out that freelance content writers are getting paid more than that for 2-4k word articles about simple things that can be learnt by reading the first paragraph on wiki. You'll probably need to increase the pay if you're looking to hire people with specialized knowledge and niches. Your rates are way too low. I charge somewhere around 2-3 cents (US) per word for content, excluding images. Rs. 700/- per article (say 500 words) is laughably low, including research. I can earn that faster working for MNREGA!

So my question is how good is ISBF, Delhi? Apparently, it's affiliated with University of London, with ""academic direction"" from London School of Economics. I'm not too sure about this as this is literally the first time I'm hearing about this institution (pardon my ignorance). I couldn't find much about it on other websites, either. I'm looking at a BBA (or a BSc in Business & Management in ISBF's case) from either Symbiosis, Pune or NMIMS, Mumbai. 

I have the option to go abroad, but I honestly doubt if it's worth spending 80L+ when I could get a similar degree in about 10L. Of course, the knowledge and exposure I'd get would be tremendous and I'd get a better pay as a fresher, but I doubt it's worth the extra $$$.

What do you guys feel? Thanks :D"," >ISBF delhi 

Lel apne moolchand vala college. This place is small but I have heard many people go there. They sent you in your final year to London which is quite good although many other universities have this program too. 

>symbiosis pune

Get ready to smoke weed everyday. You name the type of weed you want. Like Bhasin or a little kerela gold and they got you covered. If you are planning to live in a hostel get ready to get high. Peer pressure is unbelieveable 

Tip - share munchies, jaldi dost bnege. Academics sucks there. 

>mims mumbai

Lund college hai, ek Chota sa 7th floor hai bas. No fucking campus 

And fees is retardedly high. Students ki gaand maarte hai college mein. It's a strict school. Placements are quite good here though.  NMIMS would be the way to go in my opinion.  If you can go abroad, give it a try. 

Only, beware of the fact that one year master's programme from UK won't be recognised if you return to India.  Unless you are loaded don't go abroad for undergrad. Just not worth it. Study in India and go for Master's later. What's your current age? Acha ji. Well tbh I did my college around ten years ago, things have clearly changed since then.

The Ministry of Labour released an advisory asking businesses to keep paying salaries in full. How are the MSME owners of r/india coping? How many months of cash reserves do you have? Do you have any plan for managing your finances?"," We're a small engineering services provider of about 50 engineers. We have enough money to pay salary for 1 month. Maybe if we cut salaries by 50%, we can extend our cash to cover for 2 months, but this decision has not yet been taken as we're waiting for the government to say something. If this situation extends beyond 2 months, we may have to shut down our business and lay off our employees. Really hoping it doesn't come to that. Regardless, we may have to lay off few of our middle managers and low performers as the revenue forecast for FY21 is bleak.

On a different note, the government asking us to keep paying salaries is stupid. Money doesn't magically appear out of thin air. Maybe the big companies can do that, but certainly not us. This is supposed to be good time for business, I just burned through savings to prepare for this season. Having to pay lease and daily wage workers with out any work, screams a lot of production loss. I will be drowning in emi in starting of next month. Business is in good shape as I had just started to pay of business debt, now facing cash crunch never like before. Hoping for some help from finance minister. Screwed. Two shoots canceled for March and don't see any happening in the near future (3-6) months. Thankfully, I work with freelancers on project basis, but have already started getting calls from them and equipment vendors about the lack of work. 

Happy let go of my office a few months back, else would have been paying rent for nothing right now. They will be royally fucked without government help."
578,Business/Finance,Lives & livelihoods in India,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fzfkko/lives_livelihoods_in_india/,"Lives and livelihoods

Context:

The Prime Minister, while announcing the lockdown had to decide between saving lives and ensuring livelihoods. He rightly privileged the former over the latter then. As India nears the end of the lockdown period, the serious damage to the economy and livelihoods is beginning to make itself apparent. The editorial talks about various measures to manage the unprecedented crisis on the economic front.  

Issues:

There is tremendous pressure from industry bodies to opt for a nuanced policy that will help economic activity to restart.
They fear a collapse if activity is stopped for another fortnight.
Lives could be lost to hunger and livelihoods sacrificed in the lockdown.
Way ahead:

One way to sidestep this existential dilemma is by bringing on a second round of an economic relief package that goes well beyond the first both in terms of the financial commitment and the spread. 
The ₹1.7-lakh crore package announced by Finance Minister was a good start but barely accounted for 1% of GDP. India should spend at least 5% of GDP for now — about ₹10-lakh crore. 
The cash transfers to the poor should be hiked to at least ₹3,000 a month for the next three months. This should be in addition to free rations and cooking gas, as was announced earlier.
Out-of-the-box ideas for delivering support and also for raising the required funds might be required. 
The government should let go off fiscal conservatism and go all out to spend and support the economy. Economists are unanimous that there is little option now but to print money and spend (what the developed countries are doing).
In the harvest season, farmers need logistical support for moving their produce to markets.
Lenders, including NBFCs, should be granted freedom to reschedule their loan accounts so that borrowers are not under pressure to repay for fear of turning delinquent. 
A credit guarantee fund that will support non-delinquent borrowers for the next six months will be a good option. 
Such a fund can be financed through a domestic bond offering. 
The bankruptcy code should be suspended for the next six months, at least for MSMEs. 
A GST holiday for the next three months would be a good option.
The loss of revenue will be ₹3-lakh crore at worst, but in reality will be much lower than that because economic activity is at a standstill now. 
Such a move will ease cash flows for business and also obviate the need for statutory compliances at a time when the focus will have to be on getting businesses back on track. 


Conclusion:

The crisis now is without precedent and the solutions must not be conservative. Generous support from the government, and quickly delivered, is the need of the hour.", The gov want to restart the economy. I have no issue with that. But to start this stage of the virus where cases have just started to come out that's risky. Instead of stopping it this measure may accelerate the spread. Imo wait a month. Start restarting d economy from next month.

Since COVID­19 is believed to be a disease of the respiratory tract, usually only oral swabs are used for diagnosis, and discharge is based on the oral swabs testing negative. The anal positives suggested, they argued, shedding through the oral ­fecal route, and therefore transmission is possible as well. The researchers also showed that a serology test (testing blood for antibodies) can improve detection positive rate, and thus should be used in the future.
* As part of the research, samples ­ including oral swabs, anal swabs and blood were collected by Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital. Two investigations were performed the paper describes ­ In the first investigation, samples were taken from 39 patients, 7 of whom were in a ‘severe condition’. In the second investigation, samples were lifted from 139 patients, whose clinical records were not available.
* When counting all swab positives together, we found most of the positives came from oral swab (8/10, 80%) on day 0. However, this trend appears to change on day 5. We found more (6/8, 75%) anal swab positive than oral swab positive (4/8, 50%)
* The data suggested a shift from more oral positives during the early period to more anal positives during the later period
* The current strategy for the detection of viral RNA in oral swabs used for 2019­nCoV diagnosis is not perfect. The virus may be present in anal swabs or blood of patients when oral swabs detection negative
* This observation implies that a patient cannot be discharged purely based on oral swabs testing negative, and the researchers go on to make a recommendation to do serological tests to confirm the status

#### About Coronaviruses

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.

#### What is COVID-19?

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

#### About SARS

The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. SARS is more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003.

* The 2020 G20 Presidency will focus discussions, forums, working groups and Ministerial Meetings under the theme of “Realizing Opportunities of the 21st Century for All”.

#### Key Points

* Global Economy:
   * The global economic growth remains slow and downside risks due to the geopolitical and remaining trade tensions, and policy uncertainty.
   * Though the economic growth is expected to increase in 2020 and 2021 due to loose monetary policy and an easing of trade tensions.

   * It projects a “V-shaped, rapid recovery” for the global economy, but it warns about the uncertainty around the spread of the coronavirus (COVID 19).
   * The IMF also warned about other risks including rising debt levels in some countries as well as climate change.
* Demand for Global Taxation System:
   * It discussed ways to achieve consensus on a global taxation system for the digital era by the end of 2020.
   * It aims to allow governments to tax digital companies where they do business, rather than where they are registered for tax purposes.
   * India has also demanded closer collaboration between international revenue agencies to investigate the tax affairs of offenders who cross borders for escaping tax investigation.

#### G-20

* About
   * The G20 is an informal group of 19 countries and the European Union, with representatives of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
   * The G20 membership comprises a mix of the world’s largest advanced and emerging economies, representing about two-thirds of the world’s population, 85% of global gross domestic product, 80% of global investment and over 75% of global trade.
* Headquarter
   * The G20 operates as a forum and not as an organization. Therefore, it does not have any permanent secretariat or management and administrative structure.
* Origin
   * 1997-1999 Asian Financial Crisis: This was a ministerial-level forum that emerged after G7 invited both developed and developing economies. The finance ministers and central bank governors began meeting in 1999.
   * Amid the 2008 Financial Crisis, the world saw the need for a new consensus-building at the highest political level. It was decided that the G20 leaders would begin meeting once annually.
* Members
   * The members of the G20 are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union.
   * One nation holds the Chair every year, known as the 'G20 Presidency'. Argentina chaired the G20 summit of 2018 and Japan for 2019.
* V-Shaped Recovery
   * A V-shaped recovery is characterized by a sharp economic decline followed by a quick and sustained recovery.
   * The recession of 1953 is an example of a V-shaped recovery.
   * A V-shaped recovery is different from an L-shaped recovery, in which the economy stays in a slump for a prolonged period.

   * To provide efficient & time-bound citizen-centric service delivery.
   * To develop, install & implement decision support systems in courts.
   * To automate the processes to provide transparency of Information access to its stakeholders.
   * To enhance judicial productivity both qualitatively & quantitatively, to make the justice delivery system affordable, accessible, cost-effective & transparent.
* The e-Courts National portal (ecourts.gov.in) was launched in 2013. This provides Case Status, daily Case-list, Cases Filed and Cases Registered through the Case information System (CIS) Software.
* The National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) is a part of the e-Courts Integrated Mission Mode Project. It was launched in 2015. The aim is to track judicial performance across different courts in the country.
   * The NJDG is working as a National data warehouse for case data including the orders/judgments for Courts across the country.
   * NJDG works as a monitoring tool to identify, manage & reduce pendency of cases.
   * It also helps to provide timely inputs for making policy decisions to reduce delay and arrears in the system, facilitate better monitoring of court performance and systemic bottlenecks, and, thus, facilitate better resource management.
   * NJDG has specifically helped India improve its ranking in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Report.

### 6) Joint Commands

Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) office is working on a tentative timeline for the establishment of joint commands among the three defense services Army, Navy and Air Force beginning with an Air Defence Command.

#### Joint Commands

* It is a unified command in which the resources of all the services are unified under a single commander looking at a geographical theatre.
* Meaning, a single military commander, as per the requirements, will have the resources of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force to manage a security threat.
* Functions of joint command:
   * The commander of a joint command will have the freedom to train and equip his command.
   * He will have the logistics of all the services at his beckoning.
   * However, the three services will retain their independent identities as well.
* Joint command at present:
   * There are two tri-services commands at the moment.
   * The joint command at the moment, the Andaman and Nicobar Command (ANC), is a theatre command, which is headed by the chiefs of the three services in rotation. It was created in 2001 after a Group of Ministers had given a report on national security following the Kargil War.
   * The Strategic Forces Command was established in 2006 and is a functional tri-services command.
* What is the structure right now?
   * There are 17 commands, divided among the three services.
   * The Army and the Air Force have seven commands each, while the Navy has three commands.
   * These commands report to their respective services and are headed by three-star officers.
   * Though these commands are in the same regions, they are no located together.
* Need for joint commands?
   * The leader of unified command has control over more varied resources, compared to the heads of the commands under the services now. And the officer commanding will have access to the Air Force’s fighter jets and can use them if needed. Through such integration and jointness, the three forces will be able to avoid duplication of resources. The resources available under each service will be available to other services too. The services will get to know one another better, strengthening cohesion in the defense establishment.
* Do the militaries of other countries have such commands?
   * Several major militaries are divided into integrated theatre commands. China’s People’s Liberation Army has five theatre commands: Eastern, Western, Northern, Southern and Central. Its Western Theatre Command is responsible for India. The US Armed Forces have 11 unified commands, of which seven are geographic and four functional commands. Its geographic commands are Africa, Central, European, Indo-Pacific, Northern, Southern, and Space. Cyber, Special Operations, Transportation and Strategic are its functional commands.

### 8) Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR)

* The State Government of Arunachal Pradesh intends to build a highway through the 862 sq km Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR) in East Kameng district.
* The Government had in the past built a highway through the Namdapha National Park.

#### Key Points

* The project is named the East-West Industrial Corridor which is a proposed elevated corridor at the tiger reserve, to be constructed at an estimated cost of Rs.2,550 crore.
* The highway aims to connect Bhairabhunda in West Kameng district and Myanmar in Changlang district along Arunachal Pradesh’s border with Assam.
* The argument over an elevated corridor at the PTR was that it can ensure the free movement of wild animals.
* The state government felt the project would enhance connectivity and develop the state’s foothill areas into economic and industrial zones.

#### Issue Area

* Trees may have to be felled and pillars erected from the ground. Petrol, diesel and other materials will be transported, leading to loss of natural habitat.
* This corridor will be a threat to the adjoining Nameri Tiger Reserve in Assam too.

#### What should the Govt. do?

* The Government, while building such a mega project, should consult renowned conservation organizations in the area and also bring all stakeholders who will be impacted by the project on to the negotiating table.

#### Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR)

* It lies in the foothills of the Eastern Himalaya in the East Kameng district of Arunachal Pradesh.
* It falls within the Eastern Himalaya Biodiversity Hotspot.
* Pakke is also the only Hornbill sanctuary in India.
* The vegetation is predominantly tropical semi-evergreen forest.
* What makes PTR special are the brilliant efforts of the Forest Department and local communities like that of the Nyishi Tribe who inhabit the area around the park to protect the wildlife here.

580,Business/Finance,What the fuck is modi doing ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fmob0d/what_the_fuck_is_modi_doing/,"What the fuck is modi doing ? He's unfit to be leader of this country. 

He always touts his horns when representing india by elevating it as world largest democracy. 

Now what ? World's largest democracy' economy is probably will be in ruins by the time this is all over. 

As far as I have gathered:- 

He's not really giving people any financial support. He only urged people to not leave the disadvantaged behind. I understand that. But dude, even people who will be paying them will have no income stream left. 

So what maybe you pay your employees. Will your landlord be generous enough to forget your monthly payments. Maybe he is, but now even he has to pay property tax without any income stream.

He's not providing tax cuts or financing salaries of people. 

Now when this shit storm is all over he doesn't even have any policies if place if he decides a full lockdown. Many business will become bankrupt. Many company will be dissolved. It will be a period of unstable financial turmoil. Many life's will be ruined and that fucker will still not be accountable for all his action ( like erection of 3000 crore statue ) or rather his inaction. 

This could very well lead to another event like Great Depression. Without support from government many people will be laid off and many will become bankrupt. Industrial activities will be delayed as demands will be greatly reduced due to depletion of people's cash reserves."," None of this is new. He has always been doing PR giri only. It is not so much modi as the voting public, and lack of competent opposition. Yatha praja, tatha raja. Public who voted for him knew this already. You can't counter idiots with logic. They will still support him. Yes no one is talking about it. But I've seen many documentaries about our economic condition (I'm no expert but I've heard what experts been saying). This bubble was building up by the time of Congress but Manmohan was very smart. True that loans were high in that time too. But when you are in economic boom you're supposed to give loans to companies and take calculated risk. But now the loans are about 5-6 time higher, unemployment is 45 years high, bad loans have gone 3 to 9%. The bubble have been burst. Experts say normally it takes a decade to come out of this condition. That's why it is called lost decade.
Now it was before corona. Lol. Get ready to go into stone age guys. What can he do best ? He can charm the people to stay home. Most of his tv appearances in recent times have been very intense. I guess people take his words. 
What hurts me the most is where are the Ambani’s the Adanis the Virat Kohli’s the Dhoni’s the salmans the shahrukhs.  And the countless other billionaires of india.   They should come forward and donate money towards this epic fight against  Covid 19. Ghanta bajaao"

Keeping up /u/pollguard legacy and /r/India tradition. I present to you Mark My Word Thread of 2019.

**Happy Diwali Guys**

In this thread, we write down our prediction of one thing to come until Diwali 2020.

You can make prediction about absolutely anything and you do not necessarily have to justify them. Obviously you have to keep them India-centric.

Some examples at the top of mind: escalation in war, a particular party coming to power in your state, some criminal getting acquitted/found guilty, a bollywood movie breaking records, Sensex levels, exchange rate

Take your pick and some redditor in the Diwali of 2020 will dig out this thread and see how well r/India did.

I'm serious this time. 

Remind me! November 13th, 2020 [deleted] A resurgence in ""hindsight is 20/20"" type jokes. India will win >5 golds in Tokyo. I'll attend in person. I Will get one match on Tinder I would have definitely mastered the art of driving by next year Diwali, at least I hope I do. My digital marketing firm would be bigger than what it is right now and I'd get to buy/rent an office space I'll lose atleast 10kgs of weight. I would lose 15 more kilos. Would prolly work at my own or some friend's startup. I will still have no girlfriend Oxeam3 will not lose his virginity - Mark my words till 2025. I will get a job and a girlfriend next year I predict there well be at least as many false prediction as last year.

(only me so surprised so less predictions was actually true ? xD) By next Diwali, 


I will get an Internship at a good product based company or startup.


I will become a badass bald guy with an upper body like Frank Medrano's and legs like Ronaldo's. Katega I will either switch job or start preparing for UPSC


Rohit Sharma will become Indian Cricket Team's captain


Tik tok users will surpass WhatsApp users TATA will be most affected company due to economic slowdown, might decide to shut down since segments of Tata Motors.      
       
Amazon/Flipkart will be under radar of govt. Thanks to Mota Bhai, bcoz Reliance will launch e-commerce platform.     
       
Saurav Ganguly will join BJP.      
      
NRC purview will increase to multiple states. ""AAP will win Delhi 2020 election""
But I'm a NOTA supporters I'll get 99+ %ile in CAT in the coming year. Mark my words. Mark my word for 2020 -

* ""India will be superpower in 2020"" as predicted by our lovely ex-president APJ Abdul Kalam Sir. We are successfully failed in it.
2. India will make good efforts to promote electric vehicles and in green energy field.
3. Jio will start exploiting users like Airtel and Vodafone.
4. Recession will hit hard.
5. Government will close down or create problems in major PSUs.
6. MS Dhoni will retire from Cricket. I will become the main subject of a conspiracy theory. Going to get a much needed surgery.  
  
I'm going to finally move out of my parents home and get a job that's better than any of my batchmates. I'll hit the gym from next month and gain 10 Kgs. I won’t see Diwali 2020. Just a feeling.... I will do sincere efforts to improve my life I will be same next year.. Big Fat Bald Loser.. Rupee will hit new low of 85 to 1$ Priyanka chopra and nick whoever breaking up next year India will lift the WT20 2020.

I will finally get a decent job with good pay for sure.

I will fulfill my family's dreams. I will kill myself finally * Digital rights go further down the toilet, with blatant abuse of laws to ban whatever the government doesn’t want us talking about. 

* An marked shift towards Russian/Chinese style of surveillance; an attack on the intelligentsia. The government will manufacture excuses to extract details of donors to organisations/think tanks that oppose the national dialogue

* The blur between advertorials and actual news becomes so fine that people are exposed to propaganda non stop and don’t know it. This leads to an increased level of background casual racism that becomes more and more accepted. 

* BJP goes after opposition via Tax Man and the opposition eats itself like the fox from the Antichrist film and there is nothing left to oppose Modi-Shah

* Modi’s star wanes while Shahs rises. There is no major power struggle, but the writing becomes clear on the wall. 

* Water scarcity problem becomes dire and erratic weather wreaks havoc state by state, month by month. People become desensitised to the madness and uninstall PhonePe when it suggests for the umpteenth time to donate to CM flood disaster fund. 

* Internationally, nations become stricter with their immigration processes and increasing competition makes economic migration near impossible. Brain drain decreases, but in a market where cow piss research has more funding from Centre than biotech research, they are unable to contribute in a meaningful manner. 

* Amitabh Bachan dies. 

* I come out of the closet to my family, but they assume something is wrong with me. 

* Everything must burn in order to rise from the ashes. I will become superfit and get an arm tattoo. Definitely! Reduction in use of plastic and reduction in pollution. I will have a girlfriend (hope she says yes mah dudes) 

I will finally stop procrastinating and start studying again and get back my form

I will overcome my illness 

I will finally stop highlighting every sentence of my book because I don’t get what I’m reading. (Most important of all) I'll be doing an internship in summer 2020 and will have a job by Diwali 2020.

Good enough situation for PS5 I will get a job offer.       
I will learn French, at least this year properly.      
Récession will hit and it will hit hard. Will finally get serious about UPSC,  would have forgotten about Priyanka (or back with her). By next Diwali, I will have figured out this adulting business. I'll also have made up my mind about which path to take: MS in US, In India via GATE, or work at a top product co. in India. BJP won't lose any election except maybe in Delhi. They'll just show some ""slightly poor"" performances to convince people the elections aren't rigged.  I will overcome my 13 year old addition (I am tired of it). I will be  getting six packs. I will change atleast one Indian's life. I will learn  3 new things! [deleted] I will get a partner by Diwali 2020 More banks will fail. Get abs and build my legs stronger... I want to travel abroad, probably to Japan. But before that, I need a better career and need to resist the 'get married"" pressure from the family. Agle saal bhi lagra hai Single hi rahunga. Have you made list of all the predictions which have come true this year? Will save enough to book tickets for the World Expo and be ready for the trip. Finance

584,Business/Finance,Help! How do I stop my dad from squandering away his savings?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dwnioc/help_how_do_i_stop_my_dad_from_squandering_away/,"**Background:**


My dad retired 2 years back from a government organization where he did not have a pension scheme. He has saved 25L or so over the years to sustain for himself. 

He has had thoughts for opening a playschool because he wanted to do something in education. Noble idea? Yes. But he does not have any background in education/teaching etc. and understanding how schools are run. More importantly, the problem is that my dad...unfortunately, lacks business acumen and is very trusting of people. 

He tried to have a franchise with one company, signed a contract, and lost 1L there that the company refused to return. This was done without much consultation with me (where I could have at least tried to look into this and prevent it) Next, he aligned with another school and took their franchise and has spent 8L till date, running at a significant loss. 

I also have 2 elder brothers but they are not very supportive in terms of finance or else. We all are living in different cities (they in Mumbai, I am in Delhi, parents are in UP) My sister-in-law did step in as school coordinator initially but found a teaching gig (right step imo) elsewhere soonafter. Year to date, there are only 5 children with 2 teachers who mostly sit whole day. My dad acts as school coordinator. 


**Current situation:**

Lately, he argues that he will open school in own home by using the part of the building that is being rented out. (School is being run in a rented out building) He also expects me to support him financially despite my multitude of warnings, ignoring number of suggestions I made etc. To put cherry on the cake, I came across a profile of an experienced School coordinator which I suggested to my dad so that she can lead this but he rejected it because she was Muslim. (which wasn't something I expected of my dad...but that's another story)

My concern stems from the fact that this is a deep hole my dad is sinking himself into in terms of expenses. This is worrying for me because I have started job just 2 years back and expect it'd be at least 3-4 years before I am in a position where I can help him out a bit. Additionally, the current tenant has has are pretty good + it offers a recurring cashflow in terms of his savings.

My take on this is that if he wants to focus on education, why not simply open a scholarship scheme or suppport some decent schools for underpriviliged kids? While there is no upside to this financially, the amount can be fixed and it is far better use of the money IMO. 


**TL:DR** Dad burning money in an educational venture. How do I stop this?"," Get a trusted relative or a close friend of him and ask them to explain all what you said to your father. I mean get someone who is true well-wisher of your dad and is someone who your father listens to. Your dad only reason for opening school is to gain social influence among his peers and community. 

I don't think he will stop this madness until he is starved of his savings .

If he was so concerned about kids , he would have funded underprivileged children education rather than starting a school. Just make sure he doesn't start contacting any European women while he's at it. I don't understand this! You dad wants to start a school? Or does he want to teach?

Each of them are very different adventures! * Have you tried to find out what is motivating him to start the school? 
* Show him some examples of the ""risk"" associated with running a play school. Especially the legal risk (that could be deterrent to some).
* Assume he doesn't have other fall-back options (financial) for his own care/ medical expenses, then highlight that too.
* Considering that your Father has had considerable expertise in some field in the Govt sector, why not redirect him to a start a consulting firm in his core area of expertise? There are still area where experience matters, especially in Govt sector.. Don't support him financially right now, because you'll just be enabling him. Besides when he goes broke, you'll be one who they turn to. Show him Mota Bhais photo To be honest it sounds like he won't listen to you. I would suggest:


1) try to talk to him using numbers, charts, as someone suggested

2) speak to your brothers, get them to understand the financial risk, and get them to commit to supporting your dad when he loses all his savings

3) when the above don't work, speak sternly to your dad. Tell him you'll limit the money you'll give him when he burns through his. Prepare for everyone to get pissed off at you.


Unfortunately it's your financial future at stake. Everyone is going to throw kulcha in your face. Be prepared for this to become a big stink, and for him to lose all his money and for you to have to support him for the rest of his life anyway. But at least you would have tried, and can tell him and your siblings you told them so when they ask you to give up 40% of your income looking after him. If your dad wants to open a professional school,take him to see how one functions.After govt job in UP,he may have very different expectations of how work happens.Seeing a functioning one would give him context and feel for the entire project,instead of stubbornly dithering in the dark.  
If your dad just wants prestige he thinks he deserves cause of govt job,but didnt get after retirement,and is trying to manufacture said by throwing money around,abandon ship. He has to come to terms with fact that the time to throw money around has passed. I can think of two things. Either convince your dad or reduce his liquidity.

Your mother tried to talk with him? What is her stand? Can she convince your father to put at least some money in her name in non flexible instruments like NSC, PPF or tax free bonds, gold, small peice of land?

Would it be helpful to visit to a financial counselor who can point out how little 15- 25 lakh is to spend retired life?

Would it be a good idea to convince him to be associated with an educational institute for a couple of years and learn tricks of the trade?

Would he be willing to be associated with a NGO that works in field of education?

Can you try to talk to engage him with other people who tried education business but failed?

If everything fails, I think you should make it very clear that you will not support him financially. Whether you do so or not is a choice that you can make in future. 

Tread carefully on this last one. It will surely break his heart. You also risk to loose inheritance. I am just hoping that this will give him a shock and may be he will consider what he is doing. Ask him to take up full time/part-time teaching job in some govt school. No risk, impart knowledge, earn some pocket change and keeps him occupied. Let him burn it and when he is dependable on you, ruin his life witb many ""I told you so's"".

On a serious note, play school is not a very good venture to put your money in currently and its gonna br very hard to push towards profit and needs a lot of effort. So slowly do some research and shift it in your dads house buy out a share and be a 50% partner, talk like a businessman and tell him now you would handle it.

Then hire that coordinator and just give your dad a share and tell him to relax.

But make sure someone your dad listens to passes on all this to him, your dad seems to be one of those people who never listen to their kids. This is a general issue with Indian parents. They raise children as investments and expect returns from them when the children become capable (else you get labelled as 'nalayak' or 'kamini aulaad' by the society). They don't care about saving for the future, or about how they'll get money when it runs out, since you're always going to be there when things get hard. It's one of the pitfalls of a closely-knit rather than individualistic culture (but that's the discussion for another day).

I and my brother are going to be very set financially. I have an awesome job with amazing pay and my brother is in a very good college and is generally pretty good at what he does. However, I already warned my parents to not see us as investments which will generate returns and rather save for your retirement. I'm still going to help them if things get bad, but it won't be because they managed money poorly. As a result, they've started saving and investing money for themselves and aren't speculating real estate anymore.

I think you also need to do the same. Ask him how does he think he'll survive once his saving runs out. If he has a plan, good. If he doesn't, make it clear that you won't help as you've got your mouth full in a bad economy. MAKE THIS VERY, VERY CLEAR. He needs to be fucking adraid. If he still manages to get into a bad spot financially due to external factors, help him obviously. But this should stop him from squandering money.

If he wants to be nobel and wants to help, tell him to teach people at home for free or volunteer for free at a school or NGO nearby. There's a lot of help people can do with time rather than money. Why you do this op. Quit your job and help out your enterprising dad. You are lucky to have a dad who has this entrepreneurial spirit. Bc, you should help him reach his goal. This is the major problem with Indian society you don't support people who start a business. You need to help him attain this goal. 

A man at that age is having ambition is a rare occurrence. It's tells that he will have character and commitment. I don't understand why you judge that he won't succeed. You need to believe in him and his goal. He will do great , help him do great. 

As an entrepreneur this is my piece of mind"
585,Business/Finance,"Anti-national, who me? Anti-""Hindu-Nation""-al, certainly!",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ee6xey/antinational_who_me_antihindunational_certainly/,"**The goal of** ***Hindutva*** **is the religious conversion of India.**

Call me a pessimist, but I believe that the BJP is actually benefiting from the CAA+NRC protests. Call me paranoid, but I think that Modi and Shah will use the chaos in the nation to justify even more fascist measures.

Fascism relies on the dichotomy of ‘us and them’. ‘We’, the caste Hindus, led by a strong patriarch, versus the Muslims (who are really Pakistani infiltrators and/or terrorists; dirty, conniving sub-humans who want to destroy Hindustan) and the Christians (a lot of them Dalits, who ‘belong’ to Hindus but are taking away Hindu college seats and jobs, leading the country to shit, while they should be cleaning our shit).

This is *Hindutva*: hatred and ignorance masquerading as a political philosophy. Not socialism, social democracy, liberalism or conservatism, but hate. These philosophies, whatever their merits or demerits may be, take effort and dedication and love of the subject to study. Hindutva requires only hate. Forget Hindu texts, they don’t even have to study the Constitution. Doing so takes effort, you see. Hating and lynching is far easier.

This is why saffron-toting goons stop Muslims (and in [one unforgettable instance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJfvp59Kufs), Kanhaiya Kumar) and force them to chant “Jai Shree Ram”; this is why Amit Shah dehumanizes Bangladeshi migrants to “termites”; why Narendra Modi says the protesters can be recognized from their clothes.

Why abrogation of Article 370, why the blackout and human rights violations in Kashmir, why the abnormal Modia focus on Pakistan, why Ram Mandir, why NRC, why CAA? The message is clear: Muslims are not Indians, and they cannot stay. India is a Hindu Rashtra.

*But what about our Preamble? What happened to ‘sovereign socialist secular democratic republic’? What of Article 14, Article 15? Our Fundamental Rights?*

Okay, maybe we aren’t ‘socialist’ or ‘secular’ anymore. But from a young age we have been reading and hearing these words. “Unity in diversity.” “United we stand, divided we fall.” “India is the world’s largest democracy.” “We are a secular country.” “Indians are known for their hospitality.”

From our youth, the Idea of India is ingrained in us. And Hindutva -- hatred, really -- has attacked the very core of Indian-ness.

The fight today is not because we don’t want persecuted religious minorities to seek haven in India. That’s absurd. We are a very hospitable people.

We fight because 14 percent of Indians face religious persecution in their own country. We fight because the economy is going down and hatred is on the rise, and the ruling party has done nothing to fix either. Instead they are trying to alienate crores of Indians, making detention centres where at least [25 people have already died](https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/25-declared-foreigners-died-in-assam-detention-centre-750773.html) (as of 31 Jul ’19), and set the police and armed forces on peaceful protesters leading to the death of at least 20 people (as of 22 Dec ’19). Their fantasy project will cost us [lakhs of crores](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlTKGz-TvJk) (to pay for NRC, CAA and detention centres). And if 20 people have died in the 18 initial days of the protests, we may be looking at hundreds, or even thousands of deaths within the next year alone.

If you think what BJP is doing is for the good of the nation, then we disagree on the definition of ‘good’.

And we certainly disagree on the definition of a ‘nation’. Hindu Rashtra and Hindu nationalism violate the Constitution. And turning India into a theocracy like Iran is what Modi and Shah and the Sangh Parivar machinery wants to do. Can Modi say under oath that he does not want to convert India into Hindu Rashtra? Can the bhakts say so?

&#x200B;

**Fascism creates the conditions through which it can justify its own fascist policies.**

Religious conversion of India will require imposing tighter restrictions, and more fascist policies. And how does one justify the use of fascist policies?

An enemy.

While the protests have been going on, Indian and Pakistani firing across the border has increased (which was on the rise since the abrogation of 370). On [18 Dec](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/situation-along-loc-can-escalate-any-time-army-chief-bipin-rawat/articleshow/72872824.cms), Bipin Rawat issued a very provocative statement about “escalatory matrix”. On [19 Dec](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/12/letter-pakistan-india-placing-missiles-kashmir-191219101643065.html), the Pakistani Foreign Minister wrote to UN alleging India had positioned missile-launchers in Kashmir, and the Indian government refused to comment (*a* *great way to defuse tensions /s*). Then Imran Khan on [Dec 21](https://www.dawn.com/news/1523532/pakistan-will-give-befitting-response-if-india-undertakes-false-flag-operation-pm-imran) replied with such terms as “bloodbath” and “false flag operations”. And today ([22 Dec](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pakistan-violates-ceasefire-along-loc-in-jammu-and-kashmirs-rajouri-poonch/article30371876.ece)) morning there were major firing and shelling from both sides on multiple places: Pakistan [reports](https://thesouthern.com/news/world/pakistan-says-indian-shooting-kills-in-kashmir/article_e76017d4-78f9-5481-92c9-1a147f352159.html) three civilians killed with a dozen homes damaged, while India says our soldiers “retaliated effectively”.

Funnily enough, no talk of surgical strikes is floating around. Perhaps this time they do not serve Modi Ji’s purpose. Or perhaps there are no clouds in the sky? In any case, this time the purpose will perhaps be served by sacrificing our soldiers in a direct conflict. Against the Muslim-majority Pakistan.

And oh, the protesters who can be recognized by their clothes? Clearly they are Pakistani infiltrators and terrorists. The protesting students? *Tukde-tukde* gang. The professors, academicians and journalists? Anti-nationals and urban Naxals. International critics? They carry the ""white man's burden"" if they're white, and are inconsequential if they're of any other colour.

Fascism, elected democratically, will destroy democracy. Say your final “good morning” on WhatsApp.

In Nazi Germany, Jews were portrayed as dirty ‘rats’ (well, at least a mammal, not insects) who were lazy, stupid and cunning and stole the hard-working Germans’ jobs (see the contradictions?). In fact, Jews were on average well-educated and held important positions and ran businesses due to their hard work. Then through fascist policies, inch-by-inch, Nazis made the conditions unbearable for Jews, so that they really had to lose their jobs, their homes, had to live in squalor, and some started committing petty crimes to feed themselves. “See!” said the Nazis, “we told you they were cunning criminal rats!”

Thus they justified the Holocaust.

Justifying a holocaust is not that hard. We Indians are living that process of justification right now. Not so long ago, Islamophobia was frowned upon or at least hidden, and “anti-nationals” and “urban Naxals” were merely juvenile name-calling to be shrugged off (not so much for Gauri Lankesh). By creating the conditions, Modi is making these words into serious accusations, which will help him bring into effect more fascist policies, and then the Constitution will be re-written. The *ghar wapsi* of India will be complete.

We can at least make the process of justifying the holocaust hard for him. By calling out fake news, boycotting Modia, boycotting companies which support and finance BJP (you-know-who), and above all, by using non-violent means of protest. Y’know, protesting Indian-style.

*Ahimsa* is the word I believe."," I really really appreciate what you had to say. We are screwed on so many fronts that I honestly believe CAA js a good facade for the government to keep people engaged. Good news is that people are coming out in large numbers. 
The anti-muslim, anti-dalit anti-anything that isn't savarna Hindu (that too a very very specific type) policy is dangerous and the govt will unfortunately carry it out via the front or the back door.
I have also learnt a good lesson now- no party should get absolute power. The federal structure of government was designed by our founding fathers for a very sound reason. This is beautifully written. Can't disagree with any of it. Do you believe all of this will end in a remotely democratic manner? As in bjp's removal through elections? Or is it likely all bloodbath and genocide from here on culminating in civil wars and perhaps even foreign interference. As much as I agree with the spirit of this post, I completely disagree with the substance - or rather, your interpretation of India.

This isn't about _ghar wapsi_ or about Modi or, indeed, the BJP (scum though they are). This is about the creation of India as a political entity since before 1947. You see, it's this bit:

> And we certainly disagree on the definition of a ‘nation’. Hindu Rashtra and Hindu nationalism violate the Constitution. And turning India into a theocracy like Iran is what Modi and Shah and the Sangh Parivar machinery wants to do. Can Modi say under oath that he does not want to convert India into Hindu Rashtra? Can the bhakts say so?


The Constitution is only valid so long as the people of the country choose to hold it as valid. Pieces of paper have no power or sovereignty, they derive sovereignty from the people. The people have chosen to reject the constitution, because here's the kicker - the constitution and India are, and have always been, an inherently instable construct. The ideas of a secular India has always been deeply antithetical precisely because India is _not_ a nation by any rational definition of a nation. India is a hastily cobbled-together post-colonial creation that validates itself solely by creating an enemy - first the British Empire (justifiably so) and then Pakistan (unjustifiable) and Bangladesh (horrendously cruel).

It is these chickens that are, today, coming home to roost, because India's latent Hindutva was incredible easy to exploit. It always existed, it just lacked someone to point it out. And now that people are told that their Hindutva is threatened, the only justification they have always given themselves for the existence of their nation is collapsing, and they will shred the institutions meant to keep democracy safe just to keep their Hindu project safe.

India should never happened - the country was a post-colonial error, Britain's final kick to south Asia, and pretending it could ever be a secular country was a mistake. Secular nations are built on tangible cultures and cultural beliefs with concrete identities, like European nations, or Indian states. India was always Hindutva, and Hindutva was always India - all it lacked was the spark to set fire to the hatred and xenophobia that always existed, because that hatred is what justifies India's existence.

Tear the Republic down and demand statehood for your state, which is currently subjugated by India and Indianness. Sovereignty derives from a mandate of people living in consensus, and India will never have consensus that isn't phony and manufactured. That is the only way you can guarantee a better future for those not particularly religiously inclined. The idea of a Nation is based on commonality of language&culture. We preach ""Unity in Diversity"" and at the same time we also preach others to be ""Indian First"". These 2 messages are contradictory, why do we have to forgo our cultural identities to be an ""Indian"" if being Indian is just embracing the diversity?   Therein lies the ***real*** problem, the so called National Politics is stuck in a time capsule of North Centric Post-Partition Hindu-Muslim conflict. There is no nuance or logic to this narrative, BJP considers Hindu Nation as a foregone conclusion based on Partition whereas the other side doesn't have any retort other than ""let's not be a Hindu Pakistan"".

Liberals have lost the ideological battle because they're living in their own little worlds where they imagine India to be something its not. Majority of Indians don't give a damn about Progressive liberal beliefs and are drawn towards Charismatic leaders who talk in platitudes. What is the alternative to Modi? RAGA? Secularism is a noble State policy but it cannot be the only basis for a Nation. The ONLY ideological challenge Hindutva currently faces is Nativism from states such as Tamil Nadu&Bengal. Assamese opposition to CAB is also the same phenomenon, Assamese speakers have fallen below 50% in their own state and they don't want to fall any lower than that. 

>Forget Hindu texts, they don’t even have to study the Constitution

Liberals have spent the better part of 70+ years deconstructing and pointing out all the flaws of Hinduism but have done little to no attempt at highlighting the GOOD aspects of Hinduism to create a positive liberal Hindu identity. BJP has exploited this Hindu Identity vacuum by claiming that they understand&respect the good aspects of Hinduism,  people who would've sided with Liberals now side with BJP because they ""respect"" Hinduism, however superficial it may be. You should read [this article](https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/jyzFxtxjd2iGQPqA3mgOfN/Narendra-Modi-and-the-mystery-of-the-Hindu-Left.html) for more details. 

>Islamophobia

You're playing right into BJP's hands by using this term. BJP can&will use an UNO reverse card and label you as HinduPhobic.  **BottomLine:**You CANNOT defeat Hindu Identity politics by appealing to secularism&constitution ad nauseam.  You have to create a political Liberal Hindu identity in opposition to their bigoted one and market it to the masses. That is the only way i can see Hindutva going down. In summary:

1. BJP wants to change India into Hindu Rashtra
2. Muslims, Christians, Dalits and people who take the Constitution and secularism seriously will oppose that
3. Hence the BJP is hiding its intentions now; it has to change people's perceptions to normalize Hindutva even more than it is normalized currently
4. So how does it justify its fascism? By creating the conditions necessary for its justification
5. Muslims protesting in the streets will be portrayed as 'Pakistanis' or 'jihadis' who want India to become an Islamic state
6. Students will be seen as supporting Pakistan and jihadis, hence anti-nationals; they want to break India into pieces
7. Intellectuals are anti-nationals and urban Naxals, maybe even supporting China
8. Slurs such as these were merely slurs, not to be taken seriously, but now they'll become actual accusations (with perhaps legal, or extra-legal, consequences)
9. A conflict with Pakistan, or a very tangible fear of one, will help these slurs become real accusations
10. Thus BJP can justify further fascist policies like detention centres (which they deny now), and even unthinkable ones"

587,Business/Finance,GUYS I NEED HELP !!! Debt advice!!,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dyxvph/guys_i_need_help_debt_advice/,"I don't know much about running a business.My father has mortgaged our house to finance his business and has taken out a loan close to a crore, to get it running. This has induced a lost of paranoia in the house as my mom thinks that she has been made the Co applicant in the loan and is afraid that if the business fails she will lose all her retirement benefits.   My father claims that she is not the co applicant since it's a mortgage loan and she signed in a paper where it said that she won't lay any claim to the property. I keep asking my dad to show her the papers but he bypasses it somehow and when I say that we will go and speak to the bank manager about this he says that it might affect his relationship with the bank and the loan might not get renewed and it means the end of his business. He has recently invested in two different business in the last 4 months which are yet to generate considerable profits. Now he is asking me to be a co applicant in 25 lakh rupees loan for another business which he says he will get back the money in a week. But you see before i step into this mess i want to know what is what and this time Im willing to trust only real figures and official papers. But i dont know how to. So the things I want to know.

1)What are the financial liabilities of my mom in relation to my dad's business?

2)How do i know a)The current state of my dad's business? b)How much debt has he incurred?

3) How effectively is the loan money is being used?

4) Financially what I'll be putting myself into by becoming the co applicant."," First step before investing in any business, not just your Dads. 

Check the account books, This being India he would be keeping two books. One for official tax and the other to hide it. get access to both. If he does not have these details then please do not even invest a rupee.

After checking the books and doing your own analysis of revenue generated and expenses you should have a good idea what state your dads business is at. PLEASE DO THIS ANALYSIS FROM THE START OF THE BUSINESS TILL DATE. 

Second thing is to get a business plan. Tell your dad to provide a business plan, after all he is running the business. Again, if he does not have this dont Invest. 

Third and the most important rule, **NEVER GET INVOLVED IN BUSINESS VENTURES WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY.** This is a risky place to be...

If your Dad has a Company/LLP, buy the MCA records of Profit & Loss & balance sheet to know where it stands.

I do not recommend you co-sign the loan till you view the old papers & the new papers. Slightly shady, but if you have access to your dad's phone, plus his PAN number, just generate a credit report from experian or CRIF. You will get all details of his credit transactions. If it's a sole proprietorship, is your dad liable for tax audits ? If yes then you can probably try getting his tax returns or opinion ( I knows it's hard without help of your dad) from his CA who did the tax audits for your father. 

If your father is not liable then your dad's business is a pretty small one try finding his PAN and login credentials to access the return he has filed to know the position. 

Tax returns and books of accounts don't really reflect the true position but it can show you the minimum value that a company is willing to pay tax on. May be off topic a bit,

Is there a way to know the loans taken by my father? Including CAR Loans etc."

I had earlier speculated over the radical language in the economic survey implying a clear break from the past and this symbolism increases that. Let's see if the budget follows through on all this language. That speaker's smile is creepy! The budget's fiscal deficit calculation of 3.3% for 2019-2020 (Estimated) is based on the indian economy growing by 12 % over this year ! 

&#x200B;

""GDP for BE 2019-2020 has been projected at 21100607 crore assuming 12.0 % growth over the estimated GDP of \`18840731 crore for 2018-2019 (RE)"" 

\-Footnote page 3 of [Budget at a glance](https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/doc/Budget_at_Glance/bag1.pdf)

Edit : I know its the nominal figure, but it is calculated on the basis of inflation target of 4 % which in turn depends on the success of RBI and Govt policy in reviving industrial growth in the country. 8% real growth is still a massive challenge and using an inflated figure to claim that fiscal deficit will be brought down to 3.3% of estimated gdp figure for 2019-20 still implies that the fiscal deficit will rise in rupee term.

Awesome. The budget lacked action. It had few proposals but majority of it was creating a vision for India. No big schemes or proposals So for people who want a comparison of how this budget is VS something from the MMS team, here’s chidabaram presenting the 2007 budget - http://www.moneycontrol.com/budget2007/pre_budget/Union%20Budget%202004-05.pdf?classic=true

I find that while he also says “there’s a plan for that”, he backed up more of his ideas with mechanisms of actions, cut offs to identify target groups, and specific budget allocations - at least compared to what I have seen so far by 12:10 IST. 

Let’s see how things change, and hope to be pleasantly surprised.

Edit: at least the banking section is more on the ball. However I’m not sure how RBI power over NBFCs is going to fix it?

What It’s now time for our citizens duties! Is our duty to make sure we get the bang for our buck? 

Ok time for taxes.

Edit: Republican Party of India. Spend more, tax less, take on more debt, and reduce the fiscal deficit. 

Frankly, given the mess we have, even that contradictory plan is not bad. Government spending is now a major part of our teetering economy. At least that’s keeping the infra side of our economy thriving.

However someone has to pay, and with lower taxes, taking loans is the other option.

This has caused small companies to not have any incentive to increase in size and take advantage of scaling to reduce costs Wow their arms are going to break with all the patting their own backs.

It is accelerating the neo-liberal educational policies of the previous UPA government, aimed at deregulating the education sector and increasing the avenues of profit maximisation for the private capital. However, at the same time it is destroying the federal character of Indian education and is attempting to control the entire sector from the Centre, as part of the designs to push the Hindutva agenda. This is reflected in appointing RSS personnel in key administrative bodies, rewriting of history, abrupt and irrational changes in syllabi, propagation of pseudoscience, so on and so forth.

Because of GST, organizations have to bill the clients in each state that is involved because of GST norms. If before GST this required one bill, it now means multiple bills depending on the number of states involved. It could go as high 36 bills (29 states + 7 union territories.) This means that if pre-GST X effort was required to make 100 rupees, it now requires n\*X effort (1 to 36) to make 100 rupees. Meaning that the work required to make the same amount of money has increased by 100% to 3500% 

This has impacted the profit of the companies and thus the economy. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Before I begin, I am not an expert on taxation - I am a business guy working in B2B sales for an Indian MNC. My 3.5 year career has been largely post-GST, but I have experienced the pre-GST era as well. I constantly have to deal with GST and its numerous requirements.

My objective is to highlight a major roadblock that I and many other business folks have encountered due to GST, and I feel that this aspect is playing a big role in the slowdown and at the same time has been left largely unexplored till now because of the grassroot nature of the problem. The people higher up don't encounter this directly and anyone who doesn't encounter this wouldn't understand the gravity of the problem aka reporters, etc. Again to reiterate, I am not trying to debate the improvements over VAT and I am merely here to highlight a side of GST which is hindering my revenue and my profit, thus my business.

&#x200B;

Let's start with some basic concepts first:

/**1) Invoicing:** The act of giving a 'bill' for the products or services utilized by a customer. For most people, this is a simple receipt at the end of a meal for instance, or at the checkout counter of a clothing store for the clothes you've purchased, or a bill given by a cleaning service for cleaning their homes.

But for an organization, an invoice is the means to collect money from a client. Anything that is sold to a client will generate an invoice for the products delivered/services rendered. The invoice will also have the tax details (GST number, billing address, registered address, shipping address, list of items that need to be paid for, applicable tax - CGST, IGST, SGST, payment due date, and authorized signatures)

**An invoice is a means to collect cash from the client. Without a proper invoice, cash cannot be collected. This is where the problem starts. Since not having a 'proper invoice' gives a lot of ground to the client to delay the payment.**

&#x200B;

/**2) The process of Invoicing / Invoicing function in an organization:** Once the product is delivered or the services rendered, or sometimes before they are delivered, invoicing is triggered, meaning that a 'bill' is generated and the money has to be collected from the client. This is usually done through an ERP like SAP or Oracle. The invoice then reaches the collections department, where the collection manager submits the invoice to the client for verification and payment. **The collection managers are the front line people tasked with bringing money into the organization.** They are one of the most important people for running the business because their performance impacts the cash flow of the organization.

They are normally tagged to accounts, aka clients. One collection manager could be handling anywhere from one client to thousands, depending on the nature and size of their clients.

**Once the client verifies the invoice, the money is transferred to the selling organization and it becomes revenue and subsequently profit for them.**

**If the client holds the invoice for any reason, then it becomes lost revenue or a bad debt (loss) for the selling organization.** The longer the client holds this money, the lesser the value that money holds due to the concept of time-value of money. 100 rupees today is considered as more money than 100 rupees one month from now due to the time-value of money. Thus a delayed payment impacts the profitability of the organization.

**/3) GST for the services industry:** GST dictates that the invoicing for services will be done in the state where the services have been delivered. **I will explain this concept in detail as this is the crux of the problem.** To start off, I will outline a simple sale and how that sale would translate into the pre-GST and post-GST era:

**Problem Statement:** Assume that Tata Motors intend to buy 5000 chairs for their offices from Pepperfry for 50 lakh rupees. Tata Motors also wants Pepperfry to install the chairs in their offices (5 lakh rupees), and then provide 5 years warranty including a checkup every year to determine the life of the chair, and any repairs required (15 lakh rupees.) Tata Motors wants the chairs to be delivered to 50 offices in india, across 20 different states. This is a mix of products (chairs) & services (installation and maintenance.) The total bill is for 70 lakh rupees -

5000 Chairs - INR 50 Lakhs

Installation of Chairs in 50 Offices across 20 states - INR 5 Lakhs

Maintenance of Chairs for 5 years - INR 15 Lakhs

Pepperfry sales executives will take the purchase order from Tata Motors and put the order into their system. The input of the purcahse order will trigger three functions:

a) Delivery of the products & services

b) Invoicing and payment for the order

c) Post-Sale service & maintenance

**Pre-GST Invoicing:**

Before GST came into the picture, the above bill would be generated by Pepperfry as a single bill centrally ie they would generate a bill for 70 lakhs, with the extra relevant VAT and the tax details of the two organizations. This would be on **ONE SINGLE BILL** for the entire deal, irrespective of state, city, etc. They would just give Tata Motors one single piece of paper saying that they are owed 70 lakhs with the due date for the payment.

Manoj who is Pepperfrys collection manager for Tata Motors will submit this single invoice at the Tata Motors office where it will be checked by the Tata Motors procurement and finance teams, and if there is nothing wrong with the invoice, the payment will be cleared off by the due date.

**Again the point to focus on here is that only ONE INVOICE is needed for the delivery of the chairs and services to the entire country. Manoj has to submit just one invoice, follow up on invoice, and collect the payment on one invoice. Tata Motors teams have to verify one invoice, and process the payment on one invoice. Only one tax number and billing address is needed on the invoice because it is being done CENTRALLY.**

If there is something wrong with the invoice, Manoj has to correct only one invoice and resubmit it to Tata Motors.

&#x200B;

**Post-GST Invoicing:**

Like I mentioned before, GST dictates that the invoicing be done in the state where the services have been delivered ie separate GST filing for all states. Explaining further this means that a separate invoice has to be generated for each state that is involved in the transaction. If this one state involved, one invoice. If two states are involved, then two invoices. If five states are involved, then five invoices. And in this case since twenty states are involved, twenty invoices.

&#x200B;

The values of the invoices are split in direct proportion to the usage. If 100 rs is the total bill value, in three states, Maharashtra, UP & Kerala with 60:30:10 usage, then the bills will be:

Maharashtra - 60

UP - 30

Kerala - 10

So in a sense it is a separate company in each state in terms of GST.

**Moving on to the implication in the Tata Motors - Pepperfry transaction:**

Since the chairs have to be delivered in 20 states, Tata Motors & Pepperfry will have to have a registered office in all twenty states along with a GST number for each state. Tata Motors will have to issue 20 purchase orders in the proportionate value to Pepperfry ie 70 lakhs split proportionally into 20 states. The sales executive will enter twenty purchase orders into the system. Then deliveries will be triggered for 20 states and 20 different invoices will be handed over to Manoj after generation.

Manoj will submit 20 invoices to Pepperfry, whose procurement department will then verify 20 invoices, give it to finance to verify and then initiate 20 payments. Then 20 payments will be received by Tata Motors (with 20 banking transaction ID's) and Manoj will verify the 20 payments and close the transaction for now. ***This is the ideal scenario.***

As you might have been able to tell, the effort required by everyone involved in the deal has gone up 20 times. This effort required will be the same as before if there is only one state involved on the buying side, ie Maharastra selling to Maharashtra. It'll be twice the effort if two states are involved on the buying side, ie Maharashtra selling to UP & Kerala. **It has a possibility of going upto 36 time the effort required previously for the same amount of money since there are 29 states and 7 Union Territories. Yes Union Territories are treated separately as well.**

&#x200B;

**The impact from this is:**

**/1) Efficiency/Effort:** Pepperfry is still going to make 70 lakhs on the deal but the effort required will be twenty times that of before because Tata Motors will give 20 purchase orders on which 20 invoices will be generated. The time taken to process these invoices is the same because their value does not impact the time taken to collect the money on them. This is because each invoice will be the same template, its just that their  values will be different. Example:

Maharashtra

Chairs - INR 5 Lakhs

Installation - INR 50K

Support - INR 1.5 Lakhs

Kerala

Chairs - INR 3 Lakhs

Installation - INR 30K

Support - INR 90K

UP

Chairs - INR 10 Lakhs

Installation - INR 1 Lakh

Support - INR 3 Lakhs

The total money being collected is the same as before but the sales executive, Manoj, the procurement guy & the finance guy have to do 20 times the work for it with no other added value.

Their efficiency in this scenario has gone down to 5% but it can arguably go down to 2.7% if all states and union territories are involved, although this is a rare case.

Also like I said that this is the ideal scenario. It doesn't always go this smoothly. Some of the challenges encountered are:

a) Incorrect proportions of purchase orders / invoices: Someone made a mistake if 10 needed to be allocated to UP, then they've allocated 11 or 15. The process has to be repeated again after finding the fault.

b) Incorrect GST on PO / invoice: Suppose a particular invoice has the wrong GST, it means that it can't be processed on incorrect tax information, which means that that money can't be collected on that invoice. Before GST there would be one wrong tax number, now it could be one or two or twenty. Mistakes happen in the real life. This is one of the most common things we face. Mistakes happened before GST as well, now they just happen in multiples. And we really can't expect people to make mistakes because they always will. Again efficiency goes down as multiple times the effort is required to fix the mistakes.

c) Missing GST: It isn't necessary that all companies will have a GST registration in every state. So Tata Motors might not have a registered office in 2 states for example ie they won't have a GST number. They will now have to provide a declaration to Pepperfry saying that they don't have a GST number for two states, and then Pepperfry will be able to give them the invoice. The payment of the money is delayed till then. Getting that declaration in my experience takes a long time because if Tata Motors says that, they aren't able to claim input tax credit in that state. That's like leaving money on the table for them - and getting this declaration basically saying that they are willing to lose money on the transaction, requires approvals upto the highest levels because it is a loss to the company. Manoj now has to follow up on two more time consuming things to get the same amount of money and thus efficiency goes down further.

**/2) Cash Flow:** Cash is the lifeline of a company. A company without cash cannot survive. They could be valued at a billion dollars but if they don't have cash to pay their employees, they will shut down. Kingfisher couldn't pay their employees, interest, vendors because they didn't have cash left, same for Jet - again doesn't have cash for payment of salaries, fuel, loan payments, etc. BSNL again is struggling to pay for things because they don't have cash.

Thus a healthy cash flow is one of the most important aspects of the business or for the survival of the company. If companies were people, cash flow would be the oxygen. Invoicing is how cash is brought into the company.

Because of the decrease in efficiency of the collection managers, a delay is introduced in the collection of the cash. So if pre-GST cash was being collected in 25 days, now it would be taking say 45 days because the collection managers efficiency has gone down.

And the tiny delays add up. Incorrect GST - add another 7 days for that cash to be collected, missing GST - add 15 days, etc.

This has two outcomes:

Firstly, because Pepperfry had earlier predicted that they'll get the money in 30 days but they are now receiving it in 45 days, that means the 70 lakhs they need at the 30th day for their daily expenses now needs to be found from somewhere else since this 70 days will now be coming after another 2 weeks. They will have to dip into the reserves for 15 days.

Secondly, the money has lost some value. It was 70 lakhs at the end of 30 days but now since time has passed, it has lost some value due to the time value of money. It could've generated interest or it could've been invested but now this is delayed and hence some value is lost. This is a loss to Pepperfry.

To summarize, **GST has delayed the payment cycle of the company. It now takes longer to collect the same amount of money than it used to before GST was introduced. If money takes longer to come in, it takes longer to go out - salaries, interest payments, vendor payments, and other outflows are impacted.**

**/3 Profit:** The profit made on a deal varies from company to company and deal to deal. Let us assume that Pepperfry made 10% profit on this deal ie 7 lakhs. Due to the following factors this profit will get impacted:

a) The payment cycle is delayed so they're collecting the profit after a longer duration. They will have to collect 63 lakhs before they start making a profit. This could be after say they've collected 13 of the 20 invoices. The remaining 7 will give them their profit. So basically profit generation is delayed because the cash flow has been delayed. This means that the profit made on the deal has lost some value. If pre-GST this was 7 lakhs, now it'll be less than 7 lakhs in value due to the time value of money. And again because efficiency has gone down, the effort required to generate the same amount of profit has gone up, and thus the profit on the deal has actually gone down.

b) There are 20 invoices to process. Not all will always go through. Many will get stuck and the payment will be delayed or may never come due to the process issues. The money that will just linger there and never come to Pepperfry will become a bad debt to them. If the invoice gets stuck for some reason like incorrect GST, missing GST, incorrect value, the cash won't be collected for that invoice and that amount will get reduced from the profit. So because the invoice hasn't gotten processed, the 7 lakhs profit will now be less say 5 lakhs. If more than 7 lakhs is not collected on the deal, then Pepperfry will actually make a loss on the deal.

The biggest culprits of this are PSU's like HPCL, BPCL, UBI, etc. Their requirements are so stringent that if there is a single mistake and they hold the invoice. This payment could get delayed for years and thus the profit on the deal is impacted. They just won't pay till everything on the invoice is correct or they could delay for multiple other reasons. Many businesses don't sell to PSU's because of this reason - their profits and cash get stuck in doing business with them.

This is different from pre-GST because earlier if say there was a mistake, there was one invoice to fix. Now there could be many. For the same amount of revenue as before, now chances are you won't make the same amount of profit.

**Thus due to the lowered efficiency, longer payment cycle and stuck payments, the profit made has gotten impacted.**

&#x200B;

In conclusion to my ramblings, due to the state-specific nature of GST, the effort required to make the same amount of money as the pre-GST era has gone up. This has impacted the revenue and thus the profit made by companies and these are problems that everyone will face because of how GST is. If you want to do business in multiple states, you will have to be ready to face these challenges.

Feel free to discuss the impact this will have on our economy. In my opinion it has had a big impact but I really need someone much more knowledgeable than me to analyze and publish that. I feel this deserves a conversation at the very least because this one change has impacted revenue and profit extensively, it has made making money harder and thus is going to have a lasting impact on the economy. The worst part is it doesn't look like this system is going to change in the near future.

&#x200B;

I'll probably put a tl;dr later."," That was a very enlightening read, thank you for the detailed explanations and examples!

So far, I'd only read handwavy statements like ""GST is a ""game-changer"""" from ivory tower economists, but voices on the ground like yours are the ones that show reality. 

This line in particular surprised me:

>Tata Motors & Pepperfry will have to have a registered office in all twenty states along with a GST number for each state.

It's fcked up that govt expects a service provider to have registered office in every state of the client. I know it's too long. I wanted to do justice to the issue. I got tired of writing it lol but I've tried to put down as many details as possible to explain it the anyone who reads it. I know the formatting is fucked. I'll fix that later too. This is very good, even with the occasional oversimplification. You explained everything clearly.

Having to maintain GST registrations in multiple states (especially for service companies, where the service is usually delivered over the internet, without any goods moving from one state to another) is a huge pain.

One nation one tax my ass! Yeah, to add to all this:

1. If you raise an invoice, you have to pay GST the next month without fail whether you can collect the payment or not.
2. If you're an SME, you have to constantly track whether the seller is filing his sales so that you get input tax on purchases
3. Make stupid e-way bills every time you send material out of the state and make sure they are the same as invoice

Bureaucrats make these rules on paper and flowcharts without having the experience to earn a single rupee in their life and make us go through with all this bullshit. Someone is doing more work than our Finance Minister. My CA was telling me that the government has some new regulation in the works that you have to use the sarkari GST software to upload invoices on a daily basis. He said it hasn't been put into effect yet. But if he is right, that sounds like a disaster for traders Very informative post, this is the kind of posts that make reddit india worth browsing 👍 Thanks for listing this out. IMO GST is the single biggest reason behind the current economic slowdown. And what you have listed is one of the biggest reasons. Somehow the taxation and MCA rquirements have increased manifold under the Modi regime but they are not being called out in the newspapers anywhere. The left is busy labelling Modi whatnot but they arent willing to go into the details of what is actually wrong.

The problem is that the congress/left started out by calling Modi suit-boot ki sarkar. Now they cant even turn on their blame because in reality Modi government is all about more effective taxation as much as possible. ALL of the Modi govt initiatives - Demo, increased MCA compliance, GST, angel tax results in more and more taxation - what they dont get is that in the process of making taxation more effective they have dramatically increased compliance costs for most businessmen and this is negatively impact the economy. 

Modi govt is actually more leftists than the left would like to admit. And because Modi is doing these leftish shenanigans, the left is reduced to calling him names rather than criticise him on policy and specifics. I don't understand GST that well, but I used to run a company in the past (pre and post GST era). It's still running, but I've moved on. 

Whenever we had an out-of-state client, we used to raise an invoice with IGST, as opposed to CGST/SGST split for in-state clients. 

Wouldn't that simplify the invoicing?

Like, the head branch of Tata Motors in Mumbai raising a single invoice with IGST to the head branch of Pepperfry in Delhi? 

As mentioned earlier, I might have got this totally wrong, as I don't completely understand how GST works with large organizations operating in multiple states working with several vendors spread all over the country. Looks like an excellent saturday read. 
Thanks you very my good sir. Will go thru it later. Thanks so much /u/zaplinaki for making this post and taking the time to explain in all these details.

Would you be interested in cross-posting in /r/IndiaInvestments ? You just get charged IGST if company doesn't have a office/GST in the state of receipt of supply.

We receive goods from Haryana and pay 28% IGST on it. Me: What did feku do in 5yrs

Bhakts: DeMo, GST

Me: neither of them are achievements

But peanut sized brains that bhakts have don't realize this. Nobody is coming here because this thread exposes that GST is fucked up. 

Feku can do only ""One nation one <insert new nonsense here>"" No tldr, nor read. It seriously is too long. BC my thumb got tired scrolling.

For millennia, the uber rich have controlled the world. With access to better education, networking, medical, climate, resources, and technology, is it even fair for someone from a third world country or other developing nations to dream about achieving the kind of lifestyle that an average first world citizen takes for granted?

&#x200B;

Spending most of your childhood and early adulthood studying and training to land a middling job in a company is what is defined as success today. People want security and stability - something these companies seem to promise. Yet, there have been an incredible number of stories about people getting laid off for no other reason than the company hit a rough patch for once in several years. 

&#x200B;

And then there are startups, the latest in a list of Ponzi schemes designed to drain the finance out of people looking to make money. With scumbag CEOs who are able to raise funding based off of their networks from ivy league colleges (that their daddy paid a dear amount to get them into), who have absolutely no business acumen, giving themselves salaries in millions of dollars, while the wide eyed, naive poor people or immigrants who have worked hard their entire lives in the hopes of bettering their lifestyles struggle to pay rent till they are laid off, what are we even doing here? 

&#x200B;

Echo chambers are designed to consolidate like minded people into their own virtual spaces. With confirmation bias playing a significant role in hindering mental evolution, is it really a surprise that people are getting dumber by the day? For a society to be healthy and functional, different points of view must be at the very least - considered. But, when all you hear are cheers for your bigoted and backward views - it marks the end of higher thought. 

&#x200B;

The system is broken - and neither democracy nor socialism/communism is the answer. Dictatorship isn’t either. Just for clarity, violence and anger are not the answers either. The last 20 years have seen the kind of global change that our ancestors could never have imagined. Yet, our philosophies of governance have not evolved. Our constitutions are old, and our leaders are too far gone. We need to come up with new ways - starting from scratch - to govern ourselves if we want to take the next step to human evolution."," I agree with you...Only the rich is living but rest of the world is surviving.  I guess its no one’s fault. Our evolution depends on survival of the fittest, be it in good way(work hard, knowledge,innovation) or bad way(corruption,political power), everyone has to adapt to these changes. You have to outsmart other beings,learn ,improvise and adapt. The more I learn about our govt the more I believe we are past the point of redemption. Bass bacho ka nam vikar rakhna Sorry, but I don't underatand what your point is. Do you want the concepts of democracy to be updated coping up with the new times, or are you asking for a complete overhaul?

Meant positive unit economics and profitability.," Any company that seeks VC money for growth focuses solely on scaling up because that's the whole point. Scaling up raises valuation that helps current investor cash out while attracting new investors. It's only after IPO do they think of making money.

There are tons of businesses that do not take the VC route and they make plenty of money. Zoho is definitely the poster child for these kinds of businesses. Wingify (VWO), as someone else pointed out is another.

I've heard that even Swiggy, even though they opted for VC money, had positive unit economics until recently when Zomato launched their 50% off on all shit offers. Startup is not an industry, it's a company in any industry which is just starting out, I could startup selling doorknobs tomorrow and be profitable the day after or never. 

If your question is any app/service/product developed in India making money? Then there are tons of examples, but wait, are you saying is the company making money or are the owners making any money? 

Flipkart for example is not profitable, but the owners made a fuckload of money. All the employees seem to be making a lot of money and all the stakeholders made money when Walmart brought it.

The question remains who is not making the monies though. Ever heard of Zoho ? B2B software startups are closer to profitability than B2C startups. Fredhdesk , wingify ,fusioncharts come to my mind. SAAS companies are doing well financially. Others are on permanent life support through investments. Bookmyshow is an example of positive unit economics in the B2C space Do you mean profitable?

601,Business/Finance,Will India embrace blockchain?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e8as8b/will_india_embrace_blockchain/,"India has followed China in its wish to embrace the blockchain technology. The India Times reported on Nov. 27, 2019, that India's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology is set to embrace blockchain technology adopting a national strategy.

The minister of state for electronics and information technology Sanjay Dhotre said a few weeks ago:

>Considering the potential of Blockchain Technology and the need for shared infrastructure for different use cases, an approach paper on National Level Blockchain Framework is being prepared.\[...\] Blockchain Technology as one of the important research areas having application potential in different domains such as Governance, Banking and Finance, Cyber Security, and so on.

Besides, the Indian Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has supported a blockchain project ""Distributed Centre of Excellence in Blockchain Technology."" Blockchain-based ""Proof of Existence (PoE)"" framework is being developed for different uses (authenticating academic certificates, sale deeds, and other documents) by the ministry. Dhotre added:

>By using the PoE framework, \[a\] solution is developed to authenticate academic certificates. Blockchain technology has also been used, and PoC \[proof-of-concept\] is developed for vehicle life cycle management and hotel registry management.

India is developing a property registration based on the blockchain, which is being piloted in Telangana state. Other blockchain use-cases are focused on cloud security, trade finance, and central KYC.

It is worth noting that India has been experimenting with blockchain since 2017. According to Deloitte's research conducted in April 2017, Indian players tried to implement blockchain in such spheres as trade finance, supply chain financing, e-KYC document management, cross-border payments, and others.

Though India seems to be ""pro-blockchain,"" it is still negative on crypto. On July 16, 2019, India proposed a draft bill banning trading and using cryptocurrencies. To separate cryptocurrency from digital rupee and digital foreign currencies (which are backed by Central banks), the government has given a definition of crypto in the draft bill:

>Any information or code or number or token not being part of any official digital currency, generated through cryptographic means or otherwise, providing a digital representation of value which is exchange with or without consideration, with the promise or representation of having inherent value in any business activity which may involve risk of loss or an expectation of profits or income, or functions as a store of value or a unit of account and includes its use in any financial transaction or investment, but not limited to, investment schemes.

Apart from that, the report has named several reasons to ban crypto and impose fines and penalties for conducting any activities connected with it in India.

1. Crypto is created by non-sovereigns and serves as a private enterprise in this sense.
2. Crypto has no underlying intrinsic value and lacks all the characteristics of a currency.
3. Crypto has no fixed nominal value, so it neither acts as a store of value nor as a medium of exchange.
4. Crypto is extremely volatile.
5. Crypto cannot serve the purpose of a currency as it is ""inconsistent with the essential functions of money/currency"", so it cannot replace fiat.

I mean why the fuck you are going to implement system in centralized manner when blockchain is for decentralization.

For example, Land Record. Digitalization of Land Record can be done by any existing dbms system but few people want to implement using blockchain. I mean what purpose will bloclchain provide ?"

604,Business/Finance,"Pakodanomics, Ola-Uber Theory, Box Office Theory",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dlf5x8/pakodanomics_olauber_theory_box_office_theory/,"So when the most intellectual people of the country, honourable  Prime Minister, Finance Minister and IT Minister have made comments on the economy, I decided to go around and look in own way. 

***Note****: I am not an economist. I work in the IT sector and have been outside India from last two years.* 

Last week I visited Vijaywada, Andhra Pradesh almost after two years. All my relatives have settled there and once in a while, I make a visit there. To my surprise, I noticed a lot of changes in the way people spend money and businesses going there.

1. **Vastralatha** is a shopping complex in Vijayawada where a lot of wholesale shopping happens. Shop owners get the clothing raw materials (and clothes) from different locations and sell them there. It is almost the first stop for almost most of the clothes/clothing-material after manufacturing. On having a discussion with one the shopkeeper I came to know that his business gone down drastically. Despite Deepawali coming, there is no surge in sales. He says, ***""There is no cash in the market, how will people buy the goods"".*** Just to know more of him, I tried being naive and said that the government is promoting digital transactions and hence cash is less in the market, to which he replied showing a chart with many QR-codes printed on it, ***""I have PhonePe, Paytm, BHIM, Google-Pay as modes of payments still no increase in business after adopting them"".*** I said that maybe Amazon and Flipkart are consuming his business and he should try moving to online. ***""Nothing in online comes drops from air. They also must go from some outlet. I myself have proxies on Amazon and Flipkart""***
2. Vijayawada is almost like a business capital of Andhra Pradesh. A lot of people from neighbouring places come there to sell their products too. Hence a good number of 2-star and 3-star lodges are there in outskirts of Vijayawada. I then visited one such lodge, which is run by one of my friend's relative. I asked him about the hotel business the past few months to he replied, ***""Has dropped almost half in the last six months. Very few come now, and even those who come are unmarried couples.""***
3. The next day I visited a place called **Poranki**. It is outskirts of Vijayawada, almost a town. I like junk food around and generally eat at around 9:00 PM. The junk food stalls are open till 10:30 PM. I went out that day around 8:00 PM and to my surprise, I found almost all the shops closed. After wandering for 15 mins I found a shop where I ordered **Mirpakayi Bajji (***Mirchi Bhajji/ Big Chillies Fried***).** After having two of them I asked stallkeeper why have the shops closed so fast to which he replied, ***""Are you new to this place. It is happening almost from last one year. No one is having money. Those who have are also spending very cautiously. Due to the lack of customers, I am forced to close the shops early""***
4. The next day morning I visited my village from **Poranki**. *(I am sorry, I cannot tell you the village name for privacy reasons).* My grandma lives there. Besides her home, there are a lot of uneducated people who make materials like hand fans, mats, brooms, etc from coconut leaves and straw. They make them there and then go and sell locally or in other towns and cities. The place used to gleam with joy and noise when people used to sit together and stitch mats. All of that was absent. I asked our neighbour why. He replied, ***""There are more than 150 mats in stock not sold. What is the use of sitting and making more of them.""*** People make these products and travel via big share autos generally to towns. Autos are more frequent and easily available. The afternoon I went to our village bus stop, where autos also are parked nearby. I took a share auto and asked the driver about very fewer people at the bus stop. He said , ***""No one is going out of the village even to sell. Last week 3 autos drivers had sold their autos and moved into other businesses.""***

**My personal inference**: A lot bad is going. The news channels are not showing anything. The ones that do show about this, are yet very far away from the ground realities. I am just wondering about farm labours who have no source of income except daily wage. The news channels and people bragging about Hindi-Muslim debate are either paid or brainwashed. At the ground, there are many structural problems. Sadly many of them think it is their fate rather than the failure of governments."," First of all to the effort you put in. Kudos. And you have rightly observed. However most of our educated class still believes that we are doing great. The situation is far too scary then being showcased. Sorry that bhakts downvoted your post.

2. You have mentioned though, read up something about the Research process and statistics

Good luck and DM if you get through!

 Sit back, relax. Don’t try too hard. And don’t kiss ass. That shit works. They don’t expect you to know about research, because if you already knew it, what would they teach? :)

You mentioned finance & accounting as your focus area, the questions will be on what research you can do in that area. What’s your research area, why is it relevant to the business world?

For eg: let’s say you want to do a thesis in impact of AI on finance process and function - read up all you can about it. They don’t expect you to know everything about it, but enough to see that your interest in research isn’t fleeting. That’s what they want to see. 

Also, if you’ve been enrolled in a PhD program in a university, they would’ve taught you some courses in how to conduct research or research methods, use it without letting them on know that you know too much. 

Basically, why do you want to do a PhD and in what area and how that helps the business world in general.

608,Business/Finance,In need of urgent advice regarding career! Please help.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/czff99/in_need_of_urgent_advice_regarding_career_please/,"Hi,

I am a 25 year old Indian national living in Thailand with my family. I did my undergrad in Thailand in BBA in Finance. After that I joined my family trading business of loose diamonds. After a year in the business, I joined a Thailand based diamond jewelry export company (owned by an Indian-American). 

I am working in the jewelry company for the past two years but since I am the youngest I am given odd works. I am being paid 55,000 baht per month (after tax). 

I was wondering what my options for a secure future are? I am starting to get complacent in my job - getting comfortable with my monthly salary which I do not want. If I get fired or if I want to switch my job, I do not feel I have enough skills to get an equivalent salary. 

Another issue is that the jewelry industry is shrinking. I am also not sure if I enjoy the industry as much. I have a few options in mind but opinions are needed. My options are -
1. CFA
2. MBA
3. Starting a business

I am so confused in life about my career that I hate even thinking about it. My work timings are 8:30 am to 6:30 pm (Mon-Fri). Saturdays I work 8:30 am to 12:00 pm.

I have around 10 lakh baht saved since I live with my family. But we do not have any asset - no house, car, etc.

Please help.

Edit - For MBA, I would love to go to the Western countries or India - wouldn't do it in Thailand. I do not mind shifting back to India if required. My family is not very well off. My parents do not have a lot of money save for their retirement."," if you have the 'cover' of a reasonably relaxed job, use the time and space to acquire skills which are valuable in the market. Then use those to change / upgrade jobs. I leave it to you to decide what skills to acquire - too hard to give specific advice on the internet without knowing you / your circumstances in person.

Look for a confluence of personal interest (in acquiring a skill) and that  skill having high market value (people will pay you money for that skill).

Good Luck. Having a business is always the ideal solution but it is also very risky, plus you need to have a good idea that works and it will take a lot of energy and effort to even get it going.

Moving to the West is almost always a good idea if you are qualified enough as they provide better opportunities, pay and lifestyle. Returning to India may not be of much financial benefit. Please cross post on r/Indian_academia if you don't get any replies here. Hope it works out for you buddy."

I see that there is an existing master thread on the Budget. I should have ideally posted this summary there. What is PIS and FPI? \> A TV channel for startups (to be designed by startups)

Let's hope it's just not another startup news channel, 'X startup secured Y funding' is useless for 99.9% of startups.

Where as UGC type startup channel which covers knowledge rather than information i.e. 'How to identify a problem, to solve with a startup', 'How to make money with a startup', 'How to improve capital efficiency' etc. would actually be useful. What's the tax slab for hybrid vehicles going to be? Still the retarded 28+cess?

Also if this is a provision in the budget and not a rate set by the GST council, is it constitutional? If it is, then wouldn't it then become a statutory provision that the GST council cannot amend? Who will prevail? Thanku for this."
610,Business/Finance,Mourning the demise (?) of Jet Airways,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/beaonr/mourning_the_demise_of_jet_airways/,"I am surprised to see absence of Jet Airways closure in my r/india feed.

I flew on their BOM-AMD/BDQ leg couple of times and was very impressed by their customer service. They did a pretty good job in transferring international travellers to domestic route including luggage transfer. Also, as an international traveler, I was served hot delicious breakfast even on a 45 minutes flight, which was perhaps the best way to welcome back an NRI

Never got a chance to fly on their YYZ-BOM leg. Will always be a pipe dream.

Jet airways closure will be an interesting case for MBA finance students, and a reminder to all people - Always pay your bills on time!

PS. - The online newspaper articles doesn't explain why Jet Airways ran out of money despite doing good business. Can anyone care to elaborate?"," Bought air sahara despite warning from experts, had to write off, resulting cash shortage. Also stress sector and unstable government policies. [deleted] Read this article

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/jet-airways-timeline-when-and-what-happened-so-far-3846461.html Totally sad about jet airways leaving the scene. It was great service. It was also that one flight where tall people didn't need to pay more good leg room. The good days are gone. Miserly attitudes of India’s much famed middle class unwilling to pay for services, management issues, banks cracking down on companies run by truant owners, slowdown in the Indian economy etc. My few experiences on Jet have always been good. I hope they get operational with a new management soon. It employs a lot of people. Also the demand for air travel in India is only going to increase so Jet will leave a huge void in this sector. Yeah, it was a cheap flight and didn't feel as budget as Indigo or SpiceJet. Good service and great air hostesesseseses too. Will be missed. Yeah I've had a great time on Jet Airways as well.

I've only travelled by Jet , Indigo as of now.  
Had a much better time at Jet. On Jet, I was served free (and actually quite good) food. I got nothing on indigo. The airhostesses (guy and girl) seemed much much better on jet.  

At the airport itself, had a much better time with jet, than with Indigo. Not sure about others, or if I was in a special situation or anything, but yeah, I had a much better time on Jet than with Indigo.

(Travel experience : 1 round trip with jet, and another round trip with Indigo) Had a few memorable flights with jet.

Flew with jet when jet and air India was only premium offering...

Hated traveling by spice or go or indigo...

Always got middle seat empty on my sector.

Decently priced.

International circuit was good. Service was decent ( nothing too much, just enough)...

In a race with air india, it was indeed good.

As for other international carriers, it wasn't good. Nope. I only had one good experience in 2006 where i was served some decent meal and a fresh towel to wipe my face.

After the luxury of Kingfisher in it's heyday, jet always seemed over hyped and overpriced. 

Flew on their international flights last year, and it felt like i was flying Air India. Rubbish food, sparing cabin service and visibly aging aircraft. Bad situation for the employees very average airline in terms of flying experience. I didn't see the point of paying extra compared to indigo/spicejet for the almost same service. I had a jet airways flight in the morning, now I have no idea if/when I will get my money back. What are my options? I booked it through PayTM. 

What's worse is that I HAD to be where I needed to be and ended up booking a much more expensive flight. Fucking sucks. Talking about YYZ-BOM sector, looks like I am down $4000 because Jet shut down.

Today has been an absolutely awful day because of that. :(

Edit: I had booked 3 family members on AMD-BOM-YYZ return trips and I don't think I'll ever see that money. I was even thinking getting business class for one of the tickets (my grandmother). That would've been another $2000 down lol. At least I have that going for me, which is nice 3 months ago I flew jet airways from Paris chennai and back to Paris. Worst flight, service experience for an international flight. At that time itself I complained to their customer service. Sorry to say this.  I’m glad they’re out of business. I’ve flown many international airlines and this was the worst of it all. Lost all my JP miles :("

also, DHFL's stock price has been going down steep the past year.   

&nbsp;  

1. what exactly is the problem at DHFL?  
1. are they seeing poor loan repayments by home loan borrowers?  
1. is this the canary-in-coalmine   situation for a wider home-loan / real estate crash in India ?  
1. what causes led to this situation?   
1. did DHFL lend too aggressively / to 'sub prime' borrowers?  
1. what other lenders did similar practices , and are likely to face similar situation?  
1. is there any link between ILFS situation and DHFL ?  
1. if DHFL crashes (like ~~NSDL~~ NSEL, Giranjali gems, Kingfisher, etc) what would be the wider consequences? would their retail home-loan borrowers still need to continue paying EMIs after the lender company is liquidated / closed? (kek)    
1. from whom has DHFL borrowed money? what would be that lender's impact?  
1. are real-estate builders impacted in any manner due to this?  
* would this be yet another case of ""socialise the losses"" and hence some govt company (LIC esp) rescuing DHFL ?"," There are multiple factors involved.

Firstly NBFCs model is flawed. They borrow short term say 6 months to a year and lend Long term say 3-5 years.
Because of this they have to constantly keep raising funds.

Dhfl crisis happened because of poor liquidity on Dhfl part as they have some 20% exposure in bad performing real estate firms. But the Main cause of crisis is because of IL&FS. They had mismanagement of funds by senior managers of their subsidiaries because of which they defaulted on emis and the crisis began.

Now Dhfl wanted to raise funds because their short term borrowings were maturing but mutual funds as well as share market was pulling money from nbfcs as they deemed it too risky because of IL&FS. Because of this Dhfl was forced to borrow funds at very high interest.

This is the jist of it there is more to this. I recommend watching finnovationz video on this topic. NSDL crashed before? Then there is that Cobrapost expose as well. Something is shady at DHFL."

Sometimes, finance misters are corrupted, but usually, there is always someone better trained to look after the important portfolio.

http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/fcra-amendment-in-finance-bill-to-help-bjp-congress-escape-scrutiny-5049589/ Remember, in UPA's government's first term last budget, they gave debt forgiveness to farmers at a national level to win elections. The fact that NDA has not given into anything like that itself is a positive.

Budget overall is ok. More exemption for salaried class is good, LTCG is a non-issue with grandfathered gains. LTCG is there in many countries, markets will factor that in. The only change should have been LTCG at 2-3 years not 1 year.

Increase in cess sucks. Do away with all these cess and rationalize tax brackets and bring more people into the tax net. Tax farmer incomes for fuck's sake. Chud Gaye phir se salaried log Your worst fear is here!

4% cess for income tax payers along with no change in the slabs? Wow. Also 10% tax on Long Term Capital Gains and reduced corporate tax for companies making upto Rs. 250 crores (25%). Corporations need all the deductions it seems. 

If the income tax base rose to 8 crores, could you not give some relief to them by lowering taxes? Would have gotten better tax revenues with a wider base anyway.

Again, the Government sees the middle class as the silent pony to beat around with a stick.

Okay first, the cess is already 3% now ... It's been 2-3% since more than 10 years ! And the cess is calculated on the tax you have to pay and not your income. NO, THE MIDDLE CLASS DOES NOT GET FUCKED BY 1% CESS ON TAX.

Second, LTCG. Let's do the math. If you're to earn 1 lakh a year as capital gains and let's say you've earned 10% return in the year, that just means you have had 10lakhs to invest in stock market.

Someone who has 10lakhs to invest in stock market IS NOT MIDDLE CLASS. Middle class in this country is worse off than Cows of this country.

http://www.financeminutes.com/standard-deduction-back-budget-2018-relief-to-salaried-employees/ I know this will get downvoted soon, but someone needs to put this out.
A lot of people are saying/posting here how bad it is for salaried people. I posted this somewhere else a while back, and so posting again:

**Less taxes on salaries does not necessarily mean your take home salary will increase. Companies will just pay you lower (look long term not short term). Taxes on salaries are not taxes on individuals but taxes on employers.**

Please. People need to understand it. Less taxes on salaries will just give you more money in the short term. In the long term no difference.

Edit: But seriously, **if you are gonna downvote me, provide with a rebuttal. If you can't, you are contributing to spread of lies/false-information, pretty much like online trolls.** Just that this time you are at the receiving end.

Edit2: Some people think removing all taxes from salaried class people (like done for farmers) won't increase inflation. Salaried class people paid a total of Rs 1.44 lakh crore as taxes (source: http://www.businesstoday.in/union-budget-2018-19/news/budget-2018-standard-deduction-of-rs-40000-on-income-tax-actually-amounts-to-just-rs-10000-benefit/story/269379.html). That much more money and inflation won't increase. Good luck with that.

Edit3: I will delete this post within 24 hours. No point arguing when no one is ready to listen. :)

Edit4: Had I just worded this differently, ""Higher taxes doesn't mean less take home. Companies will be forced to increase salaries."" no one would have complained. :P

Edit5: A similar thing happened during demonitization. All salary-class people hailed Modi as God, Modi finally took the long-standing revenge of the salary-class against all shop-keepers, farmers, business owners. Masterstroke by Modi.
When I tried debating, most salary-classed were like: ""Why should I care, I pay all taxes, all my money is in banks, why should only salary-class pay all taxes?"". Now when the demonitization induced slowdown is gripping the entire country slowly, that is when they realize how brutally naive their arguments were.

Edit6: Ravish Kumar also said the middle class should not crib about the budget when there other much more important things to worry about.

617,Business/Finance,Business and boxing: two sides of the same coin,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cqzusw/business_and_boxing_two_sides_of_the_same_coin/,"By James M. Dorsey



A podcast version of this story is available on Soundcloud, Itunes, Spotify, Stitcher, TuneIn, Spreaker, Pocket Casts, Tumblr, and Patreon, Podbean and Castbox.



What do a planned US$15 billion Saudi investment in petroleum-related Indian businesses and a controversial boxing championship have in common?



Both reflect a world in which power and economics drive policy, politics and business at the expense of fundamental rights.



And both underscore an emerging new world order in which might is right, a jungle in which dissenters, minorities and all other others are increasingly cornered and repressed.



Rather than furthering stability by building inclusive, cohesive societies both support trends likely to produce an evermore unstable and insecure world marked by societal strife, mass migration, radicalization and violence.



A world in which business capitalizes on decisions by a critical mass of world leaders who share autocratic, authoritarian and illiberal principles of governance and often reward each other with lucrative business deals for policies that potentially aggravate rather than reduce conflict.



No doubt, the planned acquisition by Saudi Arabia’s state-owned national oil company Aramco of 20 percent of the petroleum-related businesses of Reliance Industries, one of India’s biggest companies, makes commercial and strategic economic and business sense.



Yet, there is equally little doubt that the announcement of the acquisition will be read by Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, days after he scrapped the autonomous status of the troubled, majority Muslim region of Kashmir, as a license to pursue his Hindu nationalist policies that discriminate against Muslims and other minorities and fuel tensions with Pakistan, the subcontinent’s other nuclear power.



The ultimate cost of the fallout of policies and business deals that contribute or give license to exclusion rather than inclusion of all segments of a population and aggravate regional conflict could be far higher than the benefits accrued by the parties to a deal.



Underscoring the risk of exclusionary policies and unilateral moves, cross border skirmishes between Indian and Pakistani forces erupted this week along the Kashmiri frontier in which at least five people were killed.



The timing of the announcement of the Aramco Reliance deal in a global environment in which various forms of racism and prejudice, including Islamophobia, are on the rise, assures Indian political and business leaders that they are unlikely to pay an immediate price for policies that sow discord and risk loss of life.



Like in the case of Saudi and Muslim acquiescence in China’s brutal clampdown on Turkic Muslims in the troubled, north-western Chinese province of Xinjiang, the most frontal assault on a faith in recent history, the announcement risks convincing embattled Muslim minorities like the Uighurs, the Kashmiris or Myanmar’s Rohingya who are lingering in refugee camps in Bangladesh that they are being hung out to dry.



To be sure, Kashmiris can count on the support of Pakistan but that is likely to be little more than emotional, verbal and political.



Pakistan is unlikely to risk blacklisting by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an international anti-money laundering and terrorism finance watchdog, at its next scheduled meeting in October by unleashing its anti-Indian militants.



Anthony Joshua’s controversial fight with Andy Ruiz scheduled for December in Saudi Arabia, the first boxing championship to be held in the Middle East, pales in terms of its geopolitical or societal impact compared to the Saudi Indian business deal.



Fact is that Saudi Arabia’s hosting of the championship has provoked the ire of activists rather than significant population groups. The fight is furthermore likely to be seen as evidence and a strengthening of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s selective efforts to socially liberalize the once austere kingdom.



Nonetheless, it also reinforces Prince Mohammed’s justified perception that Saudi Arabia can get away with imprisoning activists who argued in favour of his reforms as well as the lack of transparency on judicial proceedings against the alleged perpetrators of the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Saudi Arabia insists the killing was perpetrated by rogue operatives.



What Saudi investment in India and the scheduled boxing championship in the kingdom have in common is that both confirm the norms of a world in which ‘humane authority,’ a concept developed by prominent Chinese international relations scholar Yan Xuetong, is a rare quantity.



Mr. Yan employs the concept to argue without referring to President Xi Jinping, Xinjiang, China’s aggressive approach towards the South China Sea or its policy towards Taiwan and Hong Kong that China lacks the humane authority to capitalize on US President Donald J. Trump’s undermining of US leadership.



Mr. Yan defines a state that has humane authority as maintaining strategic credibility and defending the international order by becoming an example through adherence to international norms, rewarding states that live up to those norms and punishing states that violate them. Garnering humane authority enables a state to win allies and build a stable international order.



Mr. Yan’s analysis is as applicable to India and Saudi Arabia as it is to China and others that tend towards civilizational policies like the United States, Russia, Hungary and Turkey.



It is equally true for men like Anthony Joshua promoter Eddie Hearn and business leaders in general.



To be sure, Aramco is state-owned and subject to government policy. Nonetheless, as it prepares for what is likely to be the world’s largest initial public offering, even Aramco has to take factors beyond pure economic and financial criteria into account.



At the end of the day, the consequence of Mr. Yan’s theory is that leadership, whether geopolitical, economic or business, is defined as much by power and opportunity as it is by degrees of morality and ethics.



Failure to embrace some notion of humane authority and reducing leadership and business decisions to exploiting opportunity with disregard for consequences or the environment in which they are taken is likely to ultimately haunt political and business leaders alike.



Said Mr. Yan: “Since the leadership of a humane authority is able to rectify those states that disturb the international order, the order based on its leadership can durably be maintained.”

What is true for political leaders is also true for business leaders even if they refuse to acknowledge that their decisions have as much political as economic impact.

Shahni's book is a fascinating historical account of how the first electoral rolls in India were prepared. This is a process that is so technical and bureacratic that we don't always stop to consider how this laid the foundation for our democracy today. She uses archival materials to bring out how people struggled to gain the fundamental democratic right to vote in our first elections, and how this struggle informed the Constitution-making process.

Banerjee's book is an ethnographic study that attempts to answer the question of why Indians exercise their right to vote. Through interviews in a number of states, including Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Rajasthan, she asks ordinary voters why they vote, what they think of politics and elections, and what drives them to participate in the democratic process.

It cites many of the academics listed in this thread, but it's a book for everyone and each chapter covers a different election.

You'll need to mail these HRs your CV for an internship, go through a couple of rounds of interviews and then do a physical interview.

This is the proper process. You'll have a better chance at KPMG/Deloitte/PWC than EY or MBB. If you don't mind me asking, which college do you go to?

If you have a chacha-mama-papa ka dost at a Director/Partner level posn, ask him to get you in, it's much less work. 
PM if you have any more doubts.


PS: They will mostly offer IT Advisory roles to engineers, so make it clear in the initial correspondence that you're not looking for that.

 umm...why are you studying engineering btw? What college? Because all prestigious consulting firms are almost exclusively for graduates from top colleges. You're not going to get into McKinsey, Bain, BCG or even ATK unless you are an IIT-grad.

It's not about skills. These companies have to sell you to their clients. And clients will prefer an IIT/IIM grad over a random college grad.

620,Business/Finance,What are your initial /thoughts reactions to the Union Budget 2019?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c9qvq4/what_are_your_initial_thoughts_reactions_to_the/,"I thought its been 24 hrs and enough has been said about the budget so wanted to see what the general consensus about the budget in this sub.

UNION BUDGET 2019:-

Summary:  Low impact on personal finance as such.  There are some good noises on NBFC, startup, etc.  More help given to small businesses in GST.  Gold duty hiked to 12.5%.

Sustainable solutions for agriculture, waste management, pollution ++ do not cost much. Why can’t the bureaucracy look at such solutions?


Why not learn from China, how it brought down pollution in Beijing during the last few years?




FARMERS AND AGRARIAN DISTRESS


Quote
Indian farmers have, for long, ensured that the country does not face any food shortage. The time has finally come for the PM to declare: “I am confident Indian farmers can feed the nation, I annul the Essential Commodities Act”. The most critical reform to revolutionise Indian agriculture requires no money. It requires something far harder to acquire — learning to unlearn yesterday’s wisdom.

You ride on seaplane during Gujarat election, didn't left enough water for irrigation in Narmada dam. Why?
Today coastal Saurashtra is in submerged condition, forget about sea plane there isn't enough life savings boat, how can you afford seaplane?

Research fellows from IIT will be paid Rs. 70000 as stipend. Why not extend this from other institutions too? For instance, JRFs are given Rs. 25k, SRF’s Rs. 28k and RA’s Rs. 35k-40k

Experts in the field of solid waste management know that the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan can become the biggest employer, and solve several issues. But state govts and municipalities continue their nexus with contractors who charge astronomical sums for waste-handling equipment and for transportation of waste.

Why arent police being recruited in full force? There are vacancies in large numbers in almost every state?

Especially girls r subjected to violence every second in the co (Nirbhaya funds were alloted after the gruesome delhi rape case.)


What’s the current status on the Uniform Civil Code?



FEDERAL DEMOCRACY


1. It is obvious that a number of states with different parties in power are doing some things right, going by the positive outcomes. Federal Democracy is here to stay. But the needs of citizens within different states are quite different. Respect regional aspirations. One size cannot fit all, ever, in India, or elsewhere.


2. Why is the gov increasingly taking democratic institutions for granted? Ex: using governor states to boss around in the administrative matter of state government. Ex: tamilnadu, new delhi, puducherry, karnataka.



HEALTH CARE



Why does the government not take inspiration from NHS scheme in the UK (which provides efficient and great healthcare to UK residents)?

OTHER



Is it unparliamentary to hug someone in parliament as suggested by Bhupendra Chaubey?


Why are ministers with unscientific viewpoint still given cabinet portfolios?


Why does government not invest in Cyber Security like other major countries like China, Russia and USA? Our government websites and databases are not fully secured (as evident from data being accessed by fs0ciety from AP govt. website) We have great Security Engineers, but they are all employed in Private Sector.


Why was AAP asked to repay the amount they spent from government treasury on advertisement, but BJP keeps plastering Modi’s photo everyday in the newspapers and online advertisement (nearly Rs 4600 crores) without any repercussions?                                                                              

"," Good work, OP.

If possible you can add headers to improve readability.   Where is my smart city, Modi-G? 👍 Nice compilation, OP. 

Could use better formatting though. Pick 1 of this as responses to each of the questions.

- Congress did the same, when they were in power

- more than 1000 something happened in India

- You can't accept that a chaiwala has become the PM.
 >Why has the government backed away from the EV policy? 

They haven't. There is still a large subsidy for EV's and where I live, public charging infrastructure is being tested privately on a large scale.  It's going to take time to come to all cities. But they haven't backed down at all. 

Source: I am in the EV Vehicle industry. I'm listening to him talk about job creation right now. It's literally the dumbest shit I've ever heard. He's fucking assuming that people are creating jobs for other people.

Example 1: X number of students graduated from law school. If we assume that each of them started their own practice and employed 2 people then, Y number of jobs have been created. WTF?  BECAUSE CONGRESS...NEHRU...60 YEARS...EMERGENCY...HINDU IS IN DANGER! 


^^^^^^hint ^^^^^^you ^^^^^^won't ^^^^^^get ^^^^^^any ^^^^^^answers But..but..but..but.. Hindus are in danger  So many questions but there is one answer for all of them. Nehru. 100/100. Wah Modiji Wah. Forgive my lack of knowledge, but are there any inherent problems with giving special status to a state?

Also how come demonetisation led to loss of so many jobs?

Also isnt the problems with money deposits in swiss bank is that there is no way to force swiss banks to disclose details without seriously damaging diplomatic ties? Modi's reply - Bhak saala. Bjp govt is illegally controlling Admk and TN govt. This must stop.

Kiran bedi must mind her own business in puducherry.

Mining and frackong projects of ambani and adani fraudsters must stop in TN.  Wrote NP by mistake. Fixed the flair.  Fuck him. He said 1 crore jobs were made,by some ""independent survey"" and disregarded the government figures  Kek. This is so uninformed, it is hilarious!

> 5) Rafale Deal: Is there a secret pact between France & India to not reveal the cost of defence equipment being bought?

No, the pact is in the public domain. Further, the aggregate price can be revealed, and has been. In Parliament. The details cannot. 

> Why was contract taken away from HAL and given to a businessman?

Was it? Proof?

> 6) Doklam: Why was issue not raised during PM’s China summit (April 2018)?

It wasn't? Proof? If it wasn't, why did the statement mention ""peace and tranquility in all areas of the India-China border region""? u/kumbhakaran is an avid Parliament watcher.

He's be pleased to see this exhaustive list.

But all these count for zilch unless your MP raises them in Parliament and gets the govt to answer.

Can you write to your MP? Why does the goberment of Chindia tolerate weapons training camps of Bajrang Dal and RSS? This is waaaay too long to read in whole, but a couple of things I noticed near the top, a few questions I too want the answer to:

> 5) ... Why was contract taken away from HAL and given to a businessman?

Why should HAL get the contract by default? In fact, why should HAL exist in the first place? Why should any PSU exist? It is not the govt's job run the industry or banking or whatever. Rather, focus on privatizing the PSUs.

> 10) Why MSP not raised to 1.5 times of C2, as recommended by Swaminathan committee? (TMC MP)

Thank our lucky stars it wasn't! Why should MSP be raised? What evidence is there that increasing MSP benefits farmers? Why should there be a subsidy in farming in the first place? The focus should be on industrialization and creating blue collar jobs so that people don't have to be engaged in farming in the first place.
 There is this tiny question but carries a lot of weight. Who is the FM? Wtf is happening with the cabinet? Jaitley, Parrikar go off duty while being elected and stay invisible for months and some Tom Dick & Harry is a finance expert overnight? How is this okay? TL;DR. Where the fuck are my 15 lakhs! Fuck you.  -Why is the first planned Smart city - Dholera, Gujarat incomplete?

-Why isn't the government punishing the corrupt politicians from the opposition?

-Why is the unrest in Kashmir at an alltime high?

-What are the steps taken to address the stagnant prices of the real estate market and the politican-builder-banking mafia nexus?

-Why is the common man being penalized/taxed unfairly to compensate the bankrupt businessmen?

-Why are bad loans being waived off without much transparency in the process?

-What are the reasons for diplomatic failure in handling the Maldives crisis?

-Why is the energy policy still revolving around coal imports and the transition towards renewable energy slow?

-Former Railway minister said that 15 lakhs would be deposited in every Indians account once blackmoney is 
recovered. Why isn't that happening?

-Why is the government arm-twisting the AAP government in Delhi?

-Why is Gujarat's GIFT city incomplete?

-Why does the government rely on foreign import of bullet train instead of utlilizing the jobless engineering populace to improve the railway infrastructure?

-Why was Mumbai partially affected / submerged during the recent floods? Why does the most populated city have potholes despite it being a global financial centre?

-Why is the local railway infrastructure in Mumbai not being upgraded?

-Why are the fruits, vegetables and other commodities expensive and unaffordable to the common man?

-Why are lynchings at an all time high across the country?

-Why is there no clarity in the government's policy on environmental conservation?

-Why isn't the government giving capital punishment to gangrapists?

-Why is the rupee currency value at an all time low?

-Why were the AADHAR details hacked and why are government websites vulnerable to hacks?

622,Business/Finance,What would be a better decision? [Serious],https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/abqu80/what_would_be_a_better_decision_serious/,"24 year old male, working in a day job from 8 am to 8 pm. I come from a BBA in Finance background but have been working in a jewellery factory. 

I want to learn to programme and investing in the little free time I have. Programming so that I can switch jobs in two years or at the least freelance (Note: I have zero knowledge about programming). Also, after reading several articles, they mention programming is one of the jobs that is to stay even when robots become prevalent. 

My second option is to start an online business. I do not know what the business will be as I really haven't thought about it.

What would you do if you were in my position? Develop skills or start a side hustle? 

I make 50K a month and the expenses are growing exponentially. "," Bhai 8am-8pm is not a day job, it's slavery.

Aur programme ki jagah program karna seekhna.

Waise freelancers ki koi aukaat nahi hai, and i can prove that. Freelancer.com pe jaake koi bhi project daalna, india se freelancers toot padenge. I’ll just add some information to help you make your decision:
Entry level job in Infosys pays ~25k per month. But during their training period there is virtually no expenditure. 
 If you are going to learn programming for job security (and considering robots a threat, no less), without having any knowledge about it, I'd say try something else you already know. Programming can be fun but your motivations are not in line with what makes it fun. Absolutely, try it. But don't expect to earn decently in a matter of a couple of years.

Similarly, ""an online business"" is too vague. If you have some particular thing in mind, we can probably give you a fair idea if we'll buy it or not. 

If I were in your position, I'd try programming for a couple of months and look at what I can possibly sell online and if I can find business partners. I'll tell my experiences here and *then* ask how I should proceed.
 You can land yourself a high paying programming job provided you have good credentials like hackerearth rank / GSoC rank / github profile. I have seen a unemployed non-IT BSc Chemistry 27 year old guy do it by self learning coding. Good luck !! Working in jewellery factory means what? Are you a Craftsman? Learn to communicate clearly what you have experience doing otherwise people without understanding your background might give misleading advice?

If you do have some years of training and skill with your hands in making jewellery then it's not a bright idea to switch to programming. Unless you don't like your job, keep improving your skill. A skilled person plus a machine will always beat a skilled person alone or a machine alone. 

The problem with robots (like your cell phone), every two years maintaining them and updating software and changing their hardware designs (because what customers want change constantly and hardware improves constantly) is very very expensive. So having skilled people operating machines is always going to be the better choice.

Jewellery sector in India is quite big and growing esp exports. The amounts people are spending on top quality jewellery has hugely increased. 
One option maybe is to try to move to better companies/bigger brand names/export oriented companies etc and gain experience.  Typical Indian mentality : get on the IT wagon == one true and absolute certain way of survival.

So sad. the real question is why would IT companies hire you as a software dev?

there are too many of us already, and for you to catchup its going to be extremely hard. even if you somehow become good enough, 6lpa will not be what they would be paying.

Not saying it can't be done, but you should know that to make big money at big N companies, you really have to become great coder. Which is something I have been struggling with."

here's my work environment.

i want to operate from home. my parents are agreed to this and i have access to half of first floor. it's a single room where i do the assembly(tightening screws to join parts) and packing and in one corner i have a table where i do rest of company related work from a laptop.

i'm trying to outsource the packing and assembly but still i'll have to store raw materials and final stock in that room till sent to amazon warehouse or factory.

&#x200B;

i really don't have budget for renting a shop and hiring employee. i want to execute this testing phase alone. if it'll be successfull then i'll get a shop, employees and other equipments but rightnow i don't want to create too much financial burdon on my parents

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

my queries are

1. can i do my business from home . do i need to do any paperwork or permission or licencing. my stock takes space only about a refrigerator.  and all i need a printer and laptop for other stuff.
2. do i need commercial electricity meter. if so, then can my father apply for that (he owns the house and is a GOVT. employee). Is there any way i can avoid that as i'll get my own shop after testing phase and that commercial connection at home will be a waste.

&#x200B;

3.  do i need to pay rent to parents.

&#x200B;

4. can i  cause complications for my father as he's a govt. employee.

&#x200B;

5. do i need any permission from mcd or other anyone.

&#x200B;

6 do i need current account. my expenses are small and i'm currently operating from savings account.  banks (hdfc, icici, bob,axis) are asking for in house verifications and demanding a banner in front of my house. i'll never put a banner in front of house as padosi bade madar\*\*\*\* hain.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

anything else you want to advice me you're welcome guys. I'm just a 21 year old trying to escape from the rat race and want to really contribute something to the world.

&#x200B;

\[EDIT\]   do i need to register  or do anything under shop and establishment act? 

&#x200B;

do i need a manufacturers licence ?"," >my queries are

>can i do my business from home . do i need to do any paperwork or permission or licencing. my stock takes space only about a refrigerator. and all i need a printer and laptop for other stuff.

Yes, you can. no permision or licences are required.

>do i need commercial electricity meter. if so, then can my father apply for that (he owns the house and is a GOVT. employee). Is there any way i can avoid that as i'll get my own shop after testing phase and that commercial connection at home will be a waste.

No you do not. Unless you are running a factory consuming alot of electricity. Get your shop later once you make a profit.

>do i need to pay rent to parents.

Up to you, if you feel your parents deserve the revenue for allowing you to conduct business from their home. (personal relations)

>can i cause complications for my father as he's a govt. employee.

NO, this is your business. so it will not affect his job

>do i need any permission from mcd or other anyone.

NO

>do i need current account.

It is advisable to get it as you can separate your personal expense from the business expense, so get it. Most current accounts allow a minimum balance of only 10k 

If you are looking for markets to showcase your product, PM me.  You're overthinking this OP. Forget about permissions and licenses and everything else. 

Get sales first. Everything comes after that. 

Just make sure to not make your dad a director in the company (pvt ltd). Government employees can't be directors in private companies Good luck mate!
 I am very curious about your product and I hope you will post an update about it once you launch it. All the best. You need to give more information. 

What is the per piece sale price, and what is the size of the product? 

Who are your customers? How do you plan to sell the product and in what quantity.

The answers to these may change the answers to your questions. Can't you rent a shop for few months for your trial phase? 

Since your dad is a government employee, is the housing accommodation provided by his employee? If he is a government employee, then someone out there can create a fuss if they want to. That's the nature of it, and legality or the illegality of it comes later.

But again, you are at the moment not making any money. So it's okay to launch from your house. But as soon as you start making money, talk to a lawyer to see if your business needs special permits that can make your operations illegal. For instance, since the house is in your dad's name, he could be accused of moonlighting on a commercial venture. 

If you cannot find a leased space, you could also talk to your university or universities in the vicinity. Many of them have entrepreneurship cells and they could help you out with something (leasing out space, etc.)
 Bhai best of luck I wish you all the best. I can't answer your question as I am a salaried professional..

But I'd like an update once things start rolling for you.

Keep us updated.

Cheers!  [deleted] how useful is your inventions, what scale do you think you can see your invention is going to be used/sold/made.

where in the world do you see your invention being used? If you're even slightly suspicious about the advantage your invention has in a country, I'd suggest you go there and apply for a patent. The chinese would definitely give fuckall respect to your patent and will clone it anyways.

rent a commercial place and move your business into that. send it to everyone who comments here..for free..then you will automatically expand. "
624,Business/Finance,Please help me with career advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ahuc0c/please_help_me_with_career_advice/,"I am a 24 year old male with BBA in Finance. I studied in Thailand. My family lives in Thailand. We have a diamond trading business. I worked with my dad for a year before finding a job in a jewelry factory. I have been working in this factory for little over a year now.

I am being paid 55k baht a month. The problem is, there isn't much growth in this industry. I feel the industry is shrinking. I am hoping to get out by this year. Another problem is, it is very difficult to get a job as a foreigner in Thailand. 

What skills can I develop on the side so I can switch industries? I am thinking programming. But I have no prior knowledge. I do not mind coming back to India for work.

Is MBA a good option? What other ways can I make money on the side?

I have around 10 lac rupees saved."," You are making decent money and India doesn't really have the jobs or growth it used to.

Diamond trade globally is dominated by Gujju's, why not go up the supply chain and apply for management positions at customer facing companies. 

You don't seem very enthusiastic about your current line of work. You definitely need to work for a few more years to get some clarity on the general direction you want to take.

MBA is an expensive decision and should be taken with much more thought and is not a guarantee to reduce or remove your current confusion.

You have an advantage of being in a more developed country surrounded by fast growing economies along with India as a back-up. You already have some professional assets/experiences in place. Use that to discover more and learn and spend your life savings on a degree when you are sure about what you want.  So you're talking about career shift and rapid growth. with a managerial experience and international exposure, an international mba from top 20 would be a good bet. If you want to study in India, ISB is one such option. Do you hold a Thai passport? If yes, look into getting into the IIMs via the foreign student route. Much easier to get in than through the regular CAT Tell me which Indian dude gets paid 15L per annum like you are, at the age of 24? Guys with your qualification in india earn 1/5th of what you earn. Since you’ve saved 10L until now, which is a great amount of money for your age, you can do an MBA and a PGDM from a **top ranked university** under NRI quota for that amount. You’ll need a good number of years put aside for that, and then you’ll get jobs that pay above 10LPA in the beginning. After that, the sky’s the limit. I think you already earn well enough, and really don’t need to come to india which has its own problems of having way too much of competition for a job. The Thailand govt cares about their country more than India does and I think you’ll earn really well staying there instead of coming to India. Lady boi ban ja. "
625,Business/Finance,Broke up 30! What next???,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/al2pdh/broke_up_30_what_next/,"Hi Everyone,

I browse through reddit quite a bit and love the answers and support that comes especially under relationships/life.So here goes my story.

A little about myself. I'm 30 yr old Indian woman working in IT and earning well. I am the only kid and my mother raised me as a single parent after my dad left us.She has raised me to be independent and has given me freedom unlike other Indian families.

I had my share of relations when I was young and I was single for a considerable amount of time in mid 20's and I made good use of it. I started traveling and over years have come to love it. Travel opened doors for me in blogging and photography and my friends say I am decent at both. Being single also taught me value of friendships and I'm fortunate to have made some solid bonds over the years.

I met my bf (32 yrs) two years ago and with time we realized we do want to spend our lives together. As we started talking about future I realized that my bf is very keen to move to his hometown and take over his family business/ agriculture (he mentioned it casually once a yr ago. I had no idea he was serious about it).  I refused to agree for this as it is hard for me to relocate to a place which has zero opportunities for career. I hate the idea of staying at home or being dependent for finances. For the reasons above and also that I would be giving up all my friends,leaving my mom,work, travel everything for one person seemed like a bad deal.

We tried to come up with solutions but none of them made of us happy and hence agreed for mutual breakup. This breakup has left bitter feelings in me about everything. I want to stop feeling negative about my ex (somewhere I feel he could have stayed considering he has been staying in the city for 20+ yrs) and stop feeling sad for myself. I am scared that I might end up alone given the age taboo/caste etc in India and quite not sure how to deal with all the negativity in my head.Any suggestions are welcome!

Thanks,

Ablahnaari!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;"," Chill dude, no need to worry. It's better to be alone than with someone with whom you're not comfortable. Living by yourself has its own advantage.  * You have time. 30 is not that old. Get back out there when you are ready.
* Don't blame yourself, or your ex. If you wanted different things in life and had strong convictions about your choices, either one of you would have had to compromise and deal with the resentment that typically follows compromising core beliefs or the relationship would have fallen apart at some point if neither one wants to compromise. 
* If it had to end, Its better it ended now and not after you were married and in your late thirties or later.
* Give it some time and re-evaluate, feelings always clouds reality. Everyone feels like the universe is conspiring against them after something bad happens. Time heals most wounds if you let it.
* Stay Positive. I am 33 years old, have never been in a relationship, no marriage proposal seems to work out for myriad reasons, yet I keep faith while also keeping fit, enjoying my life, finding new interests and try to travel as much as I can amidst incredibly heavy pressure from my parents and ""society"". Last thing one needs is to give in to bullshit societal standards. Love has no sell by date.
* You mentioned you love to travel, do more of it, its a great distraction. Plan a trip in the near future. Travel has healing and transformative powers.

I wish you all the best!
  The dude lived in the city for 20+ years and wants to go farm? Let him. He seems passionate about it, don’t hold him back.

As for you, you are too young to be worried about what’s gonna happen to you. Take it easy and move on; you have no idea what’s in store. 

That ablanaari shit was funny though 😊 >I am scared that I might end up alone given the age taboo/caste etc in India and quite not sure how to deal with all the negativity in my head

Stop worrying about that crap and work on making yourself a better person. Pickup some new hobbies. Hang out with your friends or try making new ones. I have to admit that I have not travelled as much as you did.

But my only suggestion right now is to pack your bag and leave your home.
 You will get a  better solution as I am pretty sure you will meet up someone who has solutions to all your problems. 

LPT: Just talk to as many people as possible. find new things to do. the less you sit and ponder, the better it'll be. give it time, and then ponder, and let go.

live life forward, not backwards. You took the right longterm decision. The blaming, bitterness and sadness for a few months is common. Convince and coax your mind that you took a good positive long-term decision for the reasons you have yourself mentioned. 

*Express* your thoughts and justifications and plans in some way. For me, writing them in detail in a diary worked. But if you're not into writing, record an audio or video of yourself discussing it with yourself. 

Or if you have a close friend who's a good listener, express it in front of them. I don't know the psychology behind why expressing your thoughts to yourself or others actually helps, but it does.

As for fear of society, most people don't bother and those who trash talk you can be ignored or even belittled. Solo life is not bad as you yourself already seem to have explored it quite a bit. I'd suggest getting into any new relationship only for positive reasons - such as love and companionship - and never for negative or shallow reasons - such as fear / reputation / social status.  take it from a 24 y/o guy, who got cheated multiple times and lost faith in love.

&#x200B;

Smoke a joint, let go off things, and start afresh. 30 ain't too old. You still have a good 4-5 years before you settle down. Goodluck and learn to forgive but not forget :) 30+something, just broke up. Its very normal to hate your ex even if he/she hasnt done anything horrible. 

&#x200B;

Be kind to yourself. Im not a believer in god or spirituality but mindfulness has helped me. What are you going through is grief. Its the same feeling as you would feel if a loved one died. You probably already know the 5 stages of grief. You are going to go through all of it, not in sequence but in circles. Give yourself time and be kind to yourself. 

&#x200B;

Trust me I went through this, Im not out yet .. but I am a million times better than what I was immediately after.  curious question... is the word 'abla' or 'ablah'? i know certain indian demographic ppl like to add 'h' around their 'T's but cmon why here? i am pretty sure the actual word is abla

thankhs."

627,Business/Finance,Is Modi making Corruption systemic?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7c6kh8/is_modi_making_corruption_systemic/,"With the recent developments in the Supreme court, RBI after demonetisation, The media channels brought by BJP, The Finance bill which give political parties access to benaami funding. He is making the 0.001% at the top above law, almost god-like. This includes the business tycoons, senior most officials in the government, Ministers

EDIT:Wow getting down-voted without a debate on this. keyword Modi is trigger for downvoting?"," Modiji understands the IQ of Indian society very well , sell them dreams and victim complex - Rule forever :)  [deleted] [removed] [removed] [removed] Is that benaami donation clause honestly in the ""finance"" ""bill"" that got squeezed through LS? Feels like people have kind of moved on from that particular fuckery.

Edit: a word >developments in the Supreme court,


Heights of desperation. Nobody has literally any control over the supreme court. It is the most opaque arm of our state, always has been. Stop blaming random shit on modi, your entire argument loses value because you pull shit like this. Can't believe people just automatically upvote anything anti modi without even reading the BS in the post. So it wasn’t since the time of Indira Gandhi?

Modi is the result of the bullshit spawned by Congress over the years. Now, we have the other side corrupting the system to suit their agenda.

I don’t like Modi but I hate Congress worse.  The same SC CJI ruled in favour of AAP govt. in the LG- AAP turf war. 
And why are you blaming Modi, SC judges are appointed by collegium, not our PM Yes, there are several videos and reports which are not from the left per se. its even from centerists who argue this.

Also, you forgot Electoral bonds, which is completely annonmyous way of paying a party.

What factions usually do is try to remove blame from Modi, and pin in on the pre-existing system, absolving the leadership of everything. This is a problem because, the leaderships' inaction, rather...its tweeks to more streamline the process, is in cahoots with the pre-existing system of corruption.

Technically, the present government has not done as much damage as previous ones, but small steps it has taken to legalize corruption, will lead our nation to further ruin.

I am sure that's what our founding fathers would have wanted - ""My father, let my country be led to ruin"" (/s) Generally I think that the more autocratic a government is the more corruption flourishes. This is because fewer people have more power (and so can do bigger scams) and because they face less risks of repercussions. I read somewhere that corruption in India really kicked off with Indira Gandhi, precisely because she was the first leader to centralise a lot of power in just her close advisors/allies Corruption has been a hallmark of indian businesses and politicians way before modi, its like part of its culture and fabric of scoiety that corruption has to exist for things to run at all.

Even some people told me that without corruption, things cant function at all in india, it just depends on whether its big or small. Yeah, it was evident long ago. He's mastered the art of normalizing corruption. They don't even have to hide it. That's why you don't hear about any scams at all these days. If you don't find a view correct please put counter arguments. Downvoting only shows your confirmation bias. Yes. It's pretty good. But I'm hoping with more years in power,I'm hoping they don't make it a competition between people on the ground like the Congress did. Being a Modi supporter I always believed that Modi is doing grate thing for our future. But from past 6 months show different result and different future. Modi made Black money go away as he promised but in process of making policy of making black money harder, he just made making black money a legal and tax paying. Due to the policy other people were Abel to increase profits margins which eventually lead to high rate of products and an increase in dearness. Now due to GST and other policies all the product are almost double in price. Yes, that's the Gujarat model. More money reaches up, less remains for down guys Is 'systemic' appropriate in this case? Isn't it supposed to be more of a biological/medical term? 

Can some vocabulary nazis help out ? I think Modi is doing good job and people know that and appreciates him and thus is voting more and more BJP.

#AccheDinForeva I would happily blame PM Modi for this but corruption has been the system in developing world long before he got the top job. He is making both corruption and genocides systematic  [removed] But....He is making Sardar Patel and Lord Ram statues. He is doing things as per kulcha. Why you want foreigners family to rule india.  [removed] If parties get funding and the donors are known, does it mean citizens are tagged with each party? Does this mean, one cannot work with both sides of aisle?

If taxation is tight, how much of funding will benami attract?

When we start using percentage without evidence, it is as good as sensationalizing. 0.001% of 1 Billion population is 10 million population. Is that less or more? Do you expect all people in the country to be equally rich? or poor? 

 Accha bhai sahab, aap India main hi janaam liye hain na? Corruption has always been systemic in India.  [removed] i nearly read all comments 
realize that no body give focus on word ""systematic""
IMO OP is correct.  We seem to be moving from paying bribes to power display of mighty govt. Our rights are being cut down in the name of discipline and decisions are imposed on us without consent and consensus. [removed] devil's advocate says you need to have a back door for giving you the freedom of committing smaller crimes in order to achieve a greater good It's been systemic since much much before. But yes , he's adding fuel to the fire. Brand need ways: Corruption 2017."

  NEW DELHI: Apple wants the government to relax labelling rules so that it doesn't have to print product-related information directly onto devices to avoid cluttering up their minimalist design. That's one of the concessions Apple has sought after expressing its intention to start manufacturing in India, an official said.  

 

  The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) forwarded the iPhone maker’s request to the Department of Revenue and Department of Electronics and Information Technology (DeITY) in November for consideration, said another official. The company manufactures its products in six countries, with most being made in China.  

 

  

 

 

  Apple's distinctive design language is integral to product appeal and it strives to keep surfaces as free of artefacts as possible. The company wants to provide the product details that are required by law in India as part of the software of the device or on the packaging. The labelling issue will be dealt with by DeITY, the official said.  

 

  The company has also sought tax incentives that are being examined by the finance ministry. The government currently provides subsidies for investments in special economic zones in order to woo investors. Apple did not respond to queries.  

 

  The finance ministry had rejected an earlier proposal by Apple to set up wholly owned outlets in the country that sought exemption from the compulsory 30% local sourcing norm. The company had sought the exemption on the grounds that it was bringing ""state-of-the-art"" and “cutting-edge technology,"" making it difficult to meet the sourcing condition.  

 

  During his visit to the country earlier this year, Apple CEO Tim Cook had said India was its next big market. PM Narendra Modi had urged Cook to set up factories to make its products in India.

[Long]",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9pj0at/due_to_family_problems_i_had_to_forego_my_college/,"Sorry this is a bit long. Tl;dr at bottom

&#x200B;

I come from a middle-class family in Gujarat, and I passed my 12th commerce from a CBSE school. I got good grades and was able to enroll in a very good college in Mumbai, and everything was going well for me. After I got my admission I went back to my hometown to prepare to move to Mumbai in a hostel, when my grandfather who was already in ill-health passed away.

&#x200B;

Now he did not have a will and most of what we owned was in my father's elder brothers name already and what was in my grandfathers name was usurped by him as well. He kicked my father out of the family business as well as made threats for us to leave the place we were staying in(It was registered to my grandpas name). This meant my own families financial status went from somewhat stable to completely in shambles. We were blindsided and that meant I had to stay and help my father weather the storm. At first I thought we'd bounce back in a month or 2 and having never known poverty I never knew ho much people struggled. But it only got worse for us. My father is an 8th pass and could not get normal jobs, so he decided to start a new business and I took a job with a friend of his due to my English skills.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

After some time passed then scumbag had us evicted as he and my aunt(bua) made some deal that she should have the house. I do not know the details of what they did but we were forced to rent a place and our already poor finances were shot to pieces. My father started to work as a salesman cause no other option and I took on a bigger role at his friends place. But things were still hard and we were barely making ends meet.

&#x200B;

I forgot all about my college and education, never going back to Mumbai after my enrollment. My family trudged along for 2 and a half years but things are changing now. My father has a childhood friend who is offering my father a good role in his business back in their old village. He is moving there and starts at first November. Now he told me that I can finally go to Mumbai and finish my college if I wanted to but I'm not even sure what to do at this point.

&#x200B;

I never went to Mumbai after my admission but this year would have been my final year. Am I still even enrolled there? They have my documents as I never collected them back. But I never paid any fees except what you pay on enrollment. My father wants me to go and try to study as he thinks his lack of education was a major reason for our family's crisis cause he had nothing to fall back on.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But I don't even know if I am enrolled there anymore. The college is affiliated with Mumbai university but I could not find any details about their code on skipping exams\[By exams I mean skipping everything :( \] on google. And even If I'm still enrolled how long would it take me to finish my degree. Hell at this point I'm pondering is a [B.com](https://B.com) even worth it? My dream was to do a masters from foreign but even If I finish my degree will I get enrollment in any institute as I had these many drop years. I am really confused at this point weather to move to the village with my family or try to pursue an education.

&#x200B;

If anyone has any knowledge on how Mumbai university operates or even any advice on how to proceed please help me.

&#x200B;

Tl;dr : Scumbag uncle and aunt usurped everything and I could not attend a single day of college. Now I may finally be able to go but Idk if I am even enrolled there anymore. Please help. Any advice appreciated."," Glad your family situation is better.  Can you call the college office during working hours and see if they are willing to look into this? 

Any degree is good. B. Com should be good if you plan a business in future or pursue further studies like MBA/CA.  Bhai get back your career on track.
The best thing you could do to support your family. How old are you now ?

What do you do for a living ?


 First, go to Mumbai right away to collect your documents from the college!

Second, take it as a fresh start. If you are not sure of B.Com, think of some other option. If you are concerned about the time wasted, you could perhaps enroll for a correspondence program from IGNOU until the next academic year? Dude, from your replies, I notice you're 20. So, first off you have time on your side - LOADS of it! That's a good thing.

Now coming to your conundrum, I understand you may be anxious to share it with some admin guy in your college.  However, if it helps you re-secure your place in the college, I'd say it's worth it. However, you have to be prepared for the worst case scenario that they may not take you back. So you gotta keep your options open.

Finally, yes [B.Com](https://B.Com). is worth it. However, IF you can do, I'd suggest doing something in Economics. If you do well in Economics, there usually are good opportunities, including scholarships for Masters. Just by 2 cents. Happy to discuss if you have any further questions. "

Well, step right up to the raging wildfire that is the field of investing. We've got a shit-show full of stocks, mutual funds, bonds, real estate, gold and other commodities, all clamouring for your attention, and even more for your money. Done properly, you can retire into an ungodly amount of wealth. And done poorly, you can join the majority of investors setting their cash on fire, day in and day out. 

But don't feel daunted or scared. You're on the right path, and that's probably the only time you're going to hear those words in your life. Just the fact that you're thinking about investing your money puts you at a major advantage, just the fact that you've even made a little bit money is extremely rare. Look around you, what do you see? People that are so poor that they're crawling out of their tents on the roadside, people that are such douchebags that they're buying worthless bling like fur sweaters and gold chains, people that are so childish that they absolutely have to buy the latest iPhone with their credit cards, and people that are so dumb that they just can't be bothered to learn about investing. Just the fact that you're here now, thinking about investing, makes you part of an exclusive club.

Before you get ahead of yourself and feel one cent of happiness for being better off than most, let me tell you something - there's an army of twats waiting to screw you out of the little bit of money that you've made, an army of twats who wants to take away the only thing that matters to your miserable existence anymore. These are crooked relationship managers who'll sell you anything to get commissions. These are unsuspecting relatives who'll recommend terrible investments just because they don't know any better. These are seedy stock brokers who'll push schemes offering incredibly high returns that are too good to be true. These are corrupt financial advisors who'll destroy your returns, either because they're incompetent or unscrupulous, or both. You've got an entire armada of twats just waiting to snatch the money right out of your wallet. What're you going to do about that? Are you going to put your head down and hand over the cash? Are you going to run to your mommy like the little bitch that you are? No, you're going to pull out a knife and stab that little twat right in the heart. And here's how to do that, beginning with a set of basic guidelines. 

&nbsp;
##### Savings are sexy
Let's be honest, you were never made of the stuff that gave wet dreams to women. Well, here's your chance. You know what all the girls like these days? It's not that ripped chest, or that sleak jawline. It's a man who saves. Step aside AXE body spray, there's a new sheriff in town. If you're spending more than you're earning, you've got bigger problems to worry. Before anything else, you need to make sure that you're bringing in more money than you're spending. So reign in your spending, delay gratification. That burger is going to taste pretty much the same without the overpriced slice of cheese. And the movie will probably be on Netflix in a few months.

&nbsp;
##### Debt is your kryptonite
So you borrowed a little bit of money and are now stuck with the interest payments. That's okay, who hasn't done dumb stuff when they were young and full of hormones. I know I have. This one time I cleaned up an entire jar of mayonnaise thinking it was yogurt. Set some money aside every month, not just to pay the monthly minimum on your loans, but a little more so you can pre-pay all your debts. Some loans take priority over others: pay off your credit cards, personal loans and similar high-interest debt first. Keep in mind that not all loans are straight poison: those that help you develop assets like a home loan or increase future income like an education loan or business loan are alright. However, investing while carrying a high amount of debt is like playing football with one leg tied behind your back. Not exactly ideal.

&nbsp;
##### Read like your life depends on it
Stop reading WhatsApp forwards, pick up a book, and then pick another one. If you don't develop a habit of reading properly, you're going to get a lot of poop flinged at you in this business. But if you can make it through a book every once in a while, get read to fling some poop on the n00bs. You don't have to go straight for the finance section. Begin with any book that sounds interesting to you, and work your way up. Reading not only helps you understand the world around you, but also develops a better personality and temperament within you. Most of you have the patience and memory of a goldfish, and generally speaking, goldfishes are not good investors.

&nbsp;
##### Gold is old
Gold was what housewives in the 70s stockpiled in their cupboard because they had no other option. But you, you are the child of the 20th century. You actually know how to turn on the wi-fi. You have better options, like mutual funds. No matter what your uncle from the third cousin over says, investing in gold is setting your cash on fire. All it will do is make you feel good from the inside, while the eternal fireplace fuelled by your cash keeps burning in the background. Gold and silver are metals that we dig out of the ground. As an investment, they just sit there and stare at you. Just because they shine doesn't mean they're good investments. However, not everyone is convinced of this basic guideline. So if you're hell bent on investing in gold, I recommend going into the mountains and throwing yourself off a tall cliff. A medium-sized one works too.

&nbsp;
##### Insurance =/= Investing
While housewives in the 70s had gold, housewives in the 80s had LIC*. Getting life insurance is critical if you have family that depends on your income, but insurance and investing, like pizza and pineapple, never mix well. Have you ever wondered what the insurance company does after collecting your premium money? Well, the company invests your premium money in stocks and bonds, which is also what mutual funds do. So let the insurance people insure, and let the investing people invest. Separation of labour was something that the caveman figured out in 2nd century. It's time you evolved from being a caveman.

&nbsp;
##### Real estate is not real investing
The only reason for you to buy property is if you're going to be living in it. Buying real estate purely as an investment is one of the worst decisions you could ever make. Real estate: is an illiquid market (need to wait to find a buyer or seller), has high transaction costs (stamp duty and other bullshit charges), has a lot of red tape (needs several government approvals) and faces high maintenance costs (occasional cost of paint and plumbing here and there). However, every other Tom, Dick and Harry will tell you that real estate is a great investment. Why? Because real estate is how Indians signal wealth to others. It is how Indians demand respect from the *chaar log* committee. It's how we tell people that we've got a big dick, and we're not afraid to swing it around. You don't have a big dick. Tuck that little stinker back in your pants. You're just embarrassing yourself.

&nbsp;
##### Pick your poison properly
Identifying the bad investments is a greater skill than identifying the good investments. Now that gold and real estate have been vilified as bad investments, let's turn to the places that actually deserve your money - mutual funds. For the uninitiated, which includes most of you idiots, a mutual fund collects your money and invests it in the stock market on your behalf. A diversified basket of stocks in good quality companies will outperform most other investments over any time period longer than 10 years. Mutual funds can give you this diversified basket of stocks. If you haven't been living under a rock for the past few years, you've probably see the advertising campaign - *Mutual Funds Sahi Hai*. And if you have been living under a rock, stay there. We're doing great without you.

&nbsp;
##### Get yourself into a coma
The best investors, the ones who win the game in the long-term, always have patience. When you're investing in stocks or mutual funds, you need to have a minimum time horizon of more than 5 years. Any less than that, and out come the fireplaces that are fuelled by your cash. Mentally, you need to be in a place where the stock market might run off a cliff screaming into the wind tomorrow morning, and you'll still continue investing as per your plan because you're thinking about the long term. This ensures that your emotions, influenced by the ups and downs of the stock market, don't get in your own way. Ideally, you want to invest and immediately get yourself into a coma. Trust me, no one will notice that you're gone. You're one person in a world with seven billion people. You're really insignificant in the larger scheme of the Illuminati.

&nbsp;
##### Don't watch CNBC
All your life, you've only made socially acceptable choices, because you crave validation from the people around you. To your repitillian brain, approval from strangers feels better than an orgasm. But when it comes to investing, never seek validation of your choices, especially not from the pundits on CNBC. Televised business news focuses on the shortest of short terms, while you need to keep your eye on the longest of long terms. Yes, it is important to keep tabs on current events, but there are far better sources of information than the nightly news. I recommend reading Livemint and Reuters for news. Those two outfits did not pay me to endorse them, but if the PR people over there are reading this, give me a call. I accept cash, cheques and PayTM. Fuck it, I'll even take bitcoin.

&nbsp;
##### Keep It Simple, Shithead
Here is a basic plan on how to use your money when you get paid every month. First off, take care of any loans by paying off the hungry bankers who will come demanding their pound of flesh. Pay off all credit cards, in full and on time. Now, estimate how much you're going need for your monthly bills - this includes everything from your electric bill to your tab at the local bar. Deduct that amount and invest the rest of your money. When it comes to investing, begin by putting in three months of your monthly expenses in a liquid mutual fund. This is your emergency cash stash. Next up, depending on your time horizon and risk appetite, select a combination of ~3-8 mutual funds. There are a few different types of mutual funds, here's a handy rule of thumb to navigate them:
 
|                                    | High time horizon             | Low time horizon  |
|:----------------------------:|:----------------------------------:|:------------------------:|
| **Low risk appetite**  |Large-cap equity funds      |Debt mutual funds  |
| **High risk appetite** |Mid/small/multi-cap equity funds|Debt mutual funds  |
 
When you're done, set up SIPs so that you don't have to do the transfers manually each month. Every year, take some time off to review this process.

&nbsp;

This basic plan will require tweaking, depending on the context of your life. But having that plan is very important, not just for your financial life but also for the rest of your life. In the back of your mind, you've always known that. But you never followed through on making a plan, and now your life is just a series of mistakes and regrets. Is that why you drink so much? 

The lords of literature require that I write a conclusion to this piece. But this is not the end. This is the beginning of your investing journey. The basic guidelines mentioned here are intended to serve as the starting point for your own research. These guidelines are not rocket science, they are not supposed to be complicated. A person of average intelligence and awareness can reasonably expect to understand and follow them. The question is: are you a person of average intelligence and awareness? Assuming that enough of you read this, statistics require half of you to admit that you're dumb as a rock.

Always keep an eye out for the armada of twats that will try to convince you that investing is rocket science, simply so they can charge you high fees or lure you into unprofitable investments. Done poorly, you can expect a mid-life crisis magnified by a bonfire of your cash. Done properly, you can create the kind of wealth that can benefit you as well as your future generations. You've already disappointed your parents. Don't disappoint your children now.

"," Is this a copy-pasta or did you actually spend time making up this...whatever this is Here's the TL;DR for people who just want the important stuff, without the bells and whistles that I have to attach just to keep your short attention span:

* If you're thinking about investing, take a moment to realize that, strictly in the financial sense, you're doing better than most people in the country.
* Be aware of the people who will try to stick you with expensive and bad investments. Not everyone is out to look for your best interests.
* Make sure you're bringing in more money than you're spending. Without any money left over at the end of the month, you've got bigger fish to fry. Mmhhmm, tasty fish.
* Make sure you've got all your loans and debts under control. After your monthly EMIs, think about setting a little more money aside to prepay. Loans with higher interest rates, like credit card loans, take priority. Borrowing money isn't bad, but not having a plan to repay definitely is.
* Pick up a book every once in a while. Start reading any book that picks your curiosity and gradually move towards more topical books on personal finance. It's good for your health.
* Don't invest in gold, or any other commodity. You've got better options than that. As an investment, gold does nothing but sit there and look at you. The exit plan is just hoping that someone will pay higher than what you paid.
* Don't mix insurance and investing. They are two different services, why would you want to mix them? By separating the two, you're making your financial life simpler and easier. 
* Only buy a house if you're going to live in the said house. Property as an investment is not liquid, aces high transaction costs, requires government approvals, faces high maintenance costs and exists without any transparency.
* Identifying bad investments is a greater skill than identifying good investments. Gold and real estate are bad investments. Stocks and bonds are good investments. Mutual funds that invest in stocks and bonds allow you to benefit from them.
* Have patience. All investing is for the long term. The stock market will move up and it will move down. Some days, it won't move at all. None of this should matter to you, because all you care about is the fact that over periods longer than 10 years, the stock market has always created a great amount of wealth.
* Don't watch any televised business news channel. They give you the news of the day. You're not worried about the day. You care about the year and the decade. For news, read newspapers like Livemint and Reuters India.
* Here's a basic plan: when you get paid, make sure you pay all required EMIs on your outstanding loans. With what is left, estimate your expenses for the month. This estimate will get better with time. Take out the money etstimated, and invest the rest. Begin with having three months of expenses in a liquid fund as an emergency fund. After than, pick 3-8 mutual funds depending on your risk appetite and time horizon. Refer table above for more information. Set up SIPs so that you can force some financial discipline on yourself. Review the plan annually.
* This basic plan will require tweaking based on the context of your life. But having that plan is important.
* Investing is not rocket science. Assuming you're individual of average intelligence and awareness, even you can do it with quite satisfactory results. Beware of people who will try to convince you that investing is like open heart surgery.

&#x200B; Really well written and a fun read. Thanks for the write up. This should be a sticky at /r/indiainvestments     * Mutual fund investments are subject to market risks. Please read the offer documents carefully before investing. I used to enjoy your Last week in economy series OP. Keep up the good work. Any plans to bring it back? Huge fan here.  Great write up, OP.


If I can set aside 1,00,000 INR per month aside for investing for a year, is  creating NRE FD good or a bad decision?"
634,Business/Finance,Does anyone use Justdial?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bkceku/does_anyone_use_justdial/,"Guys. I'm sitting in a movie theatre looking at back to back Justdial ads featuring Amitabh Bachhan and  thinking, does anyone use JD these days?

I've always seen my friends and colleagues use Google to find businesses (especially with geolocation), and Urbanclap for booking services. Apart from that there are the standard food delivery and ticket booking apps like Swiggy and PayTm.

Yes, it's a pain to use multiple apps, something JD is promising to solve. But I've never seen anyone use JD regularly. Yes, I've also logged in once, maybe a few years ago and found it severely lacking in comparison to google, and left it.

Next comes the part about Financing. I think that JD is charging businesses to list themselves, but why would anyone pay? The app has a very small user base I recon. So how do they run their operations? Do they have any other mode of revenue, even from other businesses that I'm not aware about?"," Yes I do use it. Things like finding real-estate, home services, repairs, renting or hiring. Most of these small businesses are not listed on Google.

635,Business/Finance,The Kerala Model,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/79u1il/the_kerala_model/,"Let's have an objective discussion of the merits & sustainability of the Kerala model. Please don't downvote if you merely disagree. 



1. Kerala started out with 47% literacy in 1951, at a time when UP had 12% and the India-wide average was 18.33%. To claim that Kerala is high on HDI purely from post-independence governments is a bit of a stretch; they started out with a relatively compact population (13.5m in 1951) and the most advantages among states, thanks to the focus on education by the local dynastic precursors, the Travancore Family, along with contributions with subgroups like the Nair Society and Christian Missionaries. 





3. Unemployment rate: Despite the dependence on remittances and foeign jobs, the state’s unemployment rate is 12.5% against the all-India level of 5%, making it the third highest in the country after Sikkim and Tripura.  [Source](http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/not-rank-state-wants-kerala-high-unemployment-we-need-more-entrepreneurs-govt-says-61216)



3. Political Violence and the most fertile ground for ISIS recruitment in India.

4. Second last in Ease of Doing Business Ranking amongst the general category (removing the somewhat isolated NE states, troubled J&K and small Union Territories besides Delhi) and 20th rank across India. [Source](https://medium.com/@thousifmohammed/why-kerala-rank-last-in-ease-of-doing-business-7da7ed96d113) 


5. Consequently, abysmal FDI inflows, at just over US$1.2billion in 2000-15 (the last 15 years), just 0.5% of total inflows. In contrast, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka received over US$17billion and US$16billion respectively in the same period. [Source](http://indien.ahk.de/fileadmin/ahk_indien/Bilder/2015_News_and_Info/economic_news/collab_-fdi_into_india.pdf)




6. High Debt/GSDP of 29.7% (2015 Budget Estimate) compared to an India-average of 21.2%. Though that's an estimate, the 2014 Revised Estimate was 31% and 2013 actual one was 31.6%. I would take the estimate with a grain of sand. [Source](http://niti.gov.in/content/debt-total-outstanding-liabilities-percenatge-gsdp) This is also with them having a monopoly over the liquor industry through BEVCO, and one of the highest per-capita consumption levels of alcohol by state. (That's cool, I have no issues with alcohol.)

Dire position of the State Finances: [Five charts that explain the crisis in Kerala’s economy.](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/HkujNa0LphyCVSoqFFIEWK/Five-charts-that-explain-the-crisis-in-the-Kerala-economy.html) They even exceeded the Fiscal Deficit Targets which they had committed too.







2. And finally, **the extreme dependence on remittances:** Remittances finance as many as 20% Kerala households, or 2.4 million families. Assuming a family size of three, remittances directly affect 7.2 million of 35 million Keralites, according to a recent paper in the Economic and Political Weekly by K C Zachariah and S Irudaya Rajan based on the Kerala Migration Survey, 2014. [Source](http://www.firstpost.com/india/gulf-remittances-to-kerala-drop-to-four-year-low-due-to-declining-oil-prices-2738866.html)



* Remittances, at Rs 70,000 crore, accounted for 36.3% of the net state domestic product (NSDP) in 2014.



* Remittances constitute a fourth — Rs 22,689 of Rs 86,180 — of the per capita income of Kerala in 2014.



* Remittances were 1.2 times the revenue generated by the Kerala government in 2014. 



____



I like this summary: **“Remittances from global capitalism are carrying the whole Kerala economy,”** said S. Irudaya Rajan, a demographer at the Center for Development Studies, a local research group. “There would have been starvation deaths in Kerala if there had been no migration. The Kerala model is good to read about but not practically applicable to any part of the world, including Kerala.” [Source: NYTimes- Jobs Abroad Support ‘Model’ State in India.](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/07/world/asia/07migrate.html?_r=1&pagewanted=1) It's a pretty good read.






"," Damn you OP, I was expecting some mallu models

(ノಠ益ಠ)ノ Regarding the high crime rate in kerala: 

https://youtu.be/2EH6OWMUCnI

You may skip to 3:45 Every state has dependence on something. I just think that Kerala does the right things with their money. The risk associated with this source is questionable but the money itself is used in improving HDI and not just 'bijness' related indicators.

Their economy and employment is dependent on three things mainly - tourism, gelf and Bangalore. Maybe their next target itself is to reduce this dependency.

The debate is very nuanced with guys like Bhagwati and Sen arguing the merits of Gujarat and Kerala models. With economics, there are no right answers. It's just whatever works.

Now let's take the other extreme - Haryana. The economic indicators are off the charts. But people still hold onto their outdated beliefs and some parts of the state also has law and order problems and is regarded unsafe for women. Now is this development and is it sustainable? >Kerala started out with 47% literacy in 1951, at a time when UP had 12% and the India-wide average was 18.33%. 

And why was so UP being in Ganga belt had historically been a rich place of poor people . Kerala had better indicator at independence bcoz it had  and has better society . And still today UP is a highly divided society .


For Japanese miracle and their industrialization , their homogeneity and social structure played an important foundation part  As a Keralite, I find the chest thumping to be a ridiculous show-off at best and the communist revisionism to hijack all the achievements at the worst. We will be facing dire issues when the middle-east slows down significantly. I personally know so many young men pinning their futures on some small job in the gulf. 

Trade unions must be reigned in and the ease of doing business has to improve. It won't happen overnight, but that will be the greatest thing the current left government can do and only a left government can do.

I really wish there was a way for me to return to my hometown. As of now, the only way I can sustain my current income if I move back is to go freelance, and that is being optimistic. To be fair, a govt can do investment in social welfare without being communist. Just look at what Mamata Banerjee is doing in Bengal, despite me hating her, she has done some good work in mgnrega, improving the hospitals from their dismayl state, and overall improving rural infrastructure. 

The fiscal deficit and high debt you mentioned was common in communist govt of Bengal too. When the Left left, we had a high debt of over 1.5 lakh crore, and the current govt is not doing anything either to reign it. 

My main issue with Kerala model is that it can't be implemented anywhere else. It works for them, good, but we need some other way to lift other states. I like breaking big states to smaller, and then working on them. Likewise, we can produce replicas of Goa which have decent social infrastructure as well as good enough ease of doing business to lift people up.  One of the less spoken advantages of Kerala is that most of its population is either in the cities or live in close proximity to cities. I believe factors like high HDI and low IMR are because of this. 

But regardless of what brought about its high development, I think the Kerala model cannot be adopted by rest of the states. If we are looking to emulate, I guess the Tamil Nadu model of socialism has proven successful. TN may not be Kerala, but is often #2 or #3 on most counts. Again, one advantage that TN has/had that a state like UP does not is that Madras has been a prominent administration city since pre-independence. But I think any benefits from that are minimal at the moment.  Radicalization is a problem in Islam itself. I don't think the rates of radicalization are more in kerala in comparison to an equivalent Muslim population of that number elsewhere.  Do you have a source for this? While OP is raising legitimate points about Kerala’s economy, you seem to be missing the whole point about Kerala model. 

Kerala model is that It has achieved very high material Quality of life/human development indicators, despite being A low income state.

The reason it is called a model is because it is unique. Pretty much everywhere else in the world economic growth and quality of life or Human development go hand-in-hand but strangely Kerala Managed to improve material quality of life with little economic growth.

By arguing that Kerala’s economic growth track record may be considered abysmal, though a fair point, you are only reinforcing the concept of Kerala model.

Nobody calls Kerala an economic miracle, everybody knows it is not. 

Is it a replicatable model? Maybe not. Is it the key to solving the problems across the country? Definitely doesn’t seem like it. 

Has historic circumstances contributed? Perhaps. But historic and geographic reasons also limits its economic potential too. So that is argument that cuts both ways. 

Now, i would say it is facetious to argue that the outcomes have solely been due to the gulf boom, Because the impact of the gulf boom on Kerala really began only in the late 80s. 

Kerala Declared hundred percent literacy in the early 90s, which would not have been possible without strong government policies over the years. 

Also some of the places with most gulf NRIs, such as Malappuram, are actually some of the most backward areas in Kerala.  


And to give credit to the Travancore royal family is laughable, because if that were the case then many regions in Southern Tamil Nadu today was part of the  erstwhile Travancore kingdom. While, parts of the Travancore kingdom that is in Kerala have done extremely well, parts that are with Tamil Nadu have yet to catch up. Also Travancore kingdom is probably covered less than 30% of modern Kerala. 

It is very clear that the most significant government policy that laid the foundation for this transformation was the massive wealth redistribution program launched by the first Kerala government, which was a communist government. 

So, what has the Kerla model achieved? Fewer children are dying, fewer mothers are dying, there are fewer illiterate people. More and more people are getting skilled, hence are able to find higher paying jobs, albeit, elsewhere. I would argue that we are yet to yield dividends of Kerala model. 

So, yes it is a model. Is it the best model? it is hard to say. Has it its own advantages? Oh yes definitely. 
 The riot cases are high because almost everything is registered and reported.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokku_kooli

One of the most ridiculous things I have ever heard of. *Upvotes*

*Grabs popcorn*

**Let the games begin.** I think best things that happened to Kerala were, Progressive Travancore state, Early Communist government and lots of christian missionaries.

Christian missionaries and Progressive Travancore state meant that the state had a robust education system. providing for a progressive and good labor base for development. 

Communist govt took land from absentee landlords and redistributed land among landless laborers. Also, brought social parity by working against caste system. Social parity is very much a prerequisite for economic growth. Kerala achieved is much earlier than others.

State couldn't take full advantage of it's lead, but remittances or not, it did have a headstart on other states in early independence days. > 2. Unemployment rate: Despite the dependence on remittances and foreign jobs, the state’s unemployment rate is 12.5% against the all-India level of 5%, making it the third highest in the country after Sikkim and Tripura.

True. But like @i_hate_circlejerk and many others have mentioned, there is an aversion to blue collar work in Kerala. It's not because of the unavailability of jobs. It's not the best feature to have, but this happens in most emancipated societies. This is more of an issue of how daily wage work is seen from a societal perspective.  > merits & sustainability of the Kerala model

Seems to more Kerala thrashing than anything else. Don't see too many merits mentioned :) Kerala has a lot of things going for it, and I'd rather be here than anywhere else in India. But it has its own challenges as well, just like any other state.

What Malayalis should do is to not gloat too much about how they are better that this or that state in India, but really look at where they are falling short.

The reality is that if the gulf money dries up, Kerala is fucked. Either produce capital and expertise in the state, or leave your beautiful homeland to work in possibly unfriendly places for those who have it.  Why so much unemployment in kerala?  [deleted] > Kerala started out with 47% literacy in 1951, at a time when UP had 12% and the India-wide average was 18.33%.

And that 47% started off from 0, thanks to Kerala's proclivity to open up and mix with other cultures. The various social reformation movements, and influx of Christian missionaries among many other factors contributed to this. Who claimed it was all post-independence Govts? The EMS Govt. though, made giant strides in post-independence Kerala through it's [education bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala_Education_Act_1958_(Act_6_of_1959)) - it's not _all_ post independence, but a _lot_ _was_ post independence

>  Unemployment rate: Despite the dependence on remittances and foreign jobs, the state’s unemployment rate is 12.5% against the all-India level of 5%, making it the third highest in the country after Sikkim and Tripura.

True. But like @i_hate_circlejerk and many others have mentioned, there is an aversion to blue collar work in Kerala. It's not because of the unavailability of jobs. It's not the best feature to have, but this happens in most emancipated societies. This is more of an issue of how daily wage work is seen from a societal perspective. 

>  Political Violence

Violence is never a good thing, but Political violence is slightly different. Political awareness among a population is generally considered to be a prime metric in considering the collective intelligence and societal emancipation of a region. In Kerala, political awareness is super high. This is often misused by parties, but political killings like what the BJP (RSS) have been spreading, are super low. The only political killings that do happen in Kerala are always RSS - CPI (M), in North Kerala. While these are highly condemnable, they are exceedingly rare.

And also, **crime metrics are reported and recorded much more stringently in Kerala, thanks to a well functioning executive**. You might remember a report about how Scandinavia had reported extreme high cases of sexual assault. Similar situation (though high influx of migrants is also a problem there).

> Hotbed for ISIS recruitement

This seems to be the most ridiculous of them all. Almost right out of the RSS playbook. Quoting the exact same article you've quoted: 

> India’s Muslim population, the third largest in the world, has so far contributed negligible numbers to Isis – fewer than 90 people, according to most estimates. “More have gone from Britain, even from the Maldives, than India,” 

Sure, Wahhabism is a growing threat in Kerala, and more and more muslims seem to be drawn to it. But the absolute numbers here are abysmally small and can't really be considered a metric at all.


> And finally, the extreme dependence on remittances

Remittances undeniably drive a bulk of Kerala's economy. You've provided good numbers, sure. What is your point though? Agriculture and brain drain might be flipsides to it, but comparing to other states that _do_ depend on Agriculture, isn't it better that people are employed abroad and are bringing money into the economy rather than flail about in abject poverty? It is funding a flourishing society, and Malayalis have built up vast business empires abroad. And are employing thousands of Indians.

According to this logic, all of the IT engineers flocking to Bangalore, are bad for the nation, because they should be doing Agriculture, and not depend on the US for offshore development projects.




***PS: Kerala has a bunch of issues. Treatment and safety of women, fewer opportunities for employment etc. are clear and present problems. But OP seems to be more interested in painting a comprehensively poor picture of the state, misrepresenting facts. Source - 22 years in Kerala.*** >wants to discuss merits

>Points out only demerits

Yeah, OP is clearly unbiased.
 Thanks OP. As a Keralite, I felt that the whole Kerala-is-best circlejerk on randia was getting out of hand. This was sorely needed.

 3;really? lot of repetitive points.. sanghis are putting in lot of effort in researching about Kerala these days.. such sincere hardwork should be appreciated.. but cherry picking facts to peddle some agenda is not right

you can't judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree

very high population density is not suitable for manufacturing & related jobs.

Huge pressure on land means less agricultural output & heavy dependence on imports

> extreme dependence on remittances

are you trying to spin this off as some sort of insult? it's not because it means human resource is the biggest asset of Kerala.

All these people went through the hurdles of getting a passport & visa in a country where millions can't even read or write. [removed] 1. We have always been more progressive than the rest of the country. That is not a negative mark.

2. We have the low-pay jobs the rest of India counts as employment. We just leave those to out-of-state workers. We do indeed have a problem with not having the a sufficient number of higher end jobs as compared to our output of graduates. This point of yours is partially legitimate.

3. Sweden is the rape capital of the world. /s

4. We do business by the book. There is less bribery and more regulation; that makes things harder.

5. Refer previous point.

6. Debt/GSDP being a bit higher is not bad. I don't know why anyone would think that.

636,Business/Finance,Some Gyan for aspiring MBA students about which no one will bother to talk,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/84vvjc/some_gyan_for_aspiring_mba_students_about_which/,"I am 2013 MBA pass out. 

I am surprised to see so much misplaced expectations and ignorance among MBA aspirants.

I am currently working as a researcher at a think tank that evaluates quality of management education.

So, according to me, here is some general gyan -

Unless you are from top 25 B School in India, your MBA / PGDM is absolutely worthless job wise.

Private B Schools ranked outside rank 25, are only interested in your ""money"". 

Students joining outside 25 rank Private B Schools will face these hardships -

(1) Placement process will be non-transparent, skewed to benefit favorites of the institute, very few good companies.

(2) Lack of summer placements. 

(3) Some even fudge their placement figures.

(4) Average salary declared is almost always untrue.

(5) 100% placement never happens.

(6) Favoritism based on chamcha giri is rampant, you will get better grades/placement based on that.

(7) You will come across relatives or friends of the founder of the private B School posing as ""Faculty"". 

(8) Alumni networking will be non-existent. 

Also, Business Analytics is a new MBA major specialization being offered with traditional Finance/Marketing/HR. 

It makes sense to opt this from job perspective."," Just want to add to the discussion here. I'm a 2018 pass out from one of the new IIM's (set up in 2011) and the picture is not too rosy. If you have expectations of a 12lpa+ package after graduating from an IIM, there are only a few (about 30% of the batch) who have got that.  Placements are very shady and often students are forced to apply to companies which are not even heard of. Our placement process started in Nov, and there are still double digit students left to be placed with our convocation soon.

On the plus side, there is a lot to learn from studying in top 20 B-schools as the alumni interaction and pedagogy is good. All I'm emphasizing on is that the immediate reward of an extremely good job in terms of ROI and role is non-existent in the newer IIM's. What are the top 25 institutions? Seeing the state of top mba colleges ,I'd say top 20 are best. Other than that ,it's useless doing an MBA 

Many of my friends did engineering then immediately mba and now earning 6-7-8 lakhs per annum after spending 6 lakhs for two years ,doesn't make any fucking sense RoI, and brand name play a major role when it comes to do an MBA. I agree with OP to the point that this case of high competition, rat race and missed opportunities exists even among top 10 colleges of the country. Thus, if you are planning to do an MBA, go ahead only if it suits your profile or your expected career progression, and not just because everyone is doing it.  Thanks for posting this - people need to know the kind of fraud MBA education is in many colleges. 

My friend was the secretary of the owner of some private institutions who owned some B and C grade schools and colleges. They decided to start an MBA college and built one fancy looking building within another campus of their college. They were not affiliated with anyone and offered a post-graduate diploma in something-something-MBA. (Note that they are not affiliated to anyone and this diploma is just a worthless piece of paper).

They were having a tough time attracting candidates and one day the CEO asked my friend, her secretary to go and find out what the issue was. He went there during the admission seasons and also joined in with the supporting staff. He managed to convince 12 students to join the institute. The CEO immediately made him the Admission officer for the institute. The next year, the second batch under him got 32 admissions.

The fees in the first year was 8 lakhs and the second year had been hiked to 10 lakhs! 

(After the 2nd year, my friend requested a ""transfer"" to an engineering college so that he wouldn't feel guilty about how he was literally cheating people to do an ""MBA"" that had no value at all.) Where did you do your MBA from, OP? Is Christ University Bangalore any good ? How would you rate the Indian School of Business? CAT 18 aspirant here(not serious as per now), currently studying in an average engineering college. 

80% chances that I will be placed in a mass recruiting company. 

MS from abroad or MBA from India, as a fresher.? Don't downvote, ik both of them are completely different but my aim is to get a good package and a better life (the reason abroad). I belong from a middle class family but parents are ready to spend around 40lakhs for education. Hows fore and symbiosis? Which was your MBA institution?  [deleted] How's SCMHRD? Asking for my sister who's planning to do MBA this year  Just a clarification, what constitutes top 25 though?

Rankings in India are very different in different systems. I'd say the Old IIMs come first, then MDI, XLRI, FMS, IIFT & SPJIMR. Some IITs are also in the top 25. Any particular list to follow? You can read this article .....

637,Business/Finance,Is it worth moving to Canada on the basis of job opportunity at the age of 50 as an Indian Male???,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9w2du8/is_it_worth_moving_to_canada_on_the_basis_of_job/,"I have been holding a license from IRDA, government of India as approved insurance surveyor (for collision of Automobiles) & valuator since 1990. As valuator I have been holding approved licence from other competent authority of India too.

I am Diploma Automobile, post diploma in sales management, B Tech (Mech), MBA Finance, Fellow IIISLA, Alternate dispute resolution and other professional qualifications also. I have my own proprietorship company and having office in prime location of Ahmedabad city of India. As a surveyor we get the allotment of work from insurers. As valuator we generally get the valuation work from banking sector, NBFC etc for refinance purpose of assets like cars, commercial vehicles, Engineering equipment, plant & machineries, earth movers, mining equipment etc.   

Looking to the current scenario of India-Ahmedabad. it seems that the some of the issues like inflation, population, traffic, pollution, reservation, parking issues etc are never going to be solved. They are being increased day by day. India has become of 130 cr. Mentality of certain class people are on too below level and we feel that it is never going to be changed. Business scenario is also being deteriorated due drastic and impractical changes in government policy. Political leaders are minting their own except few. As per international media India is growing but as per my experience picture of actual India is different.

For last 3 years l have been getting job offer from Canada. In 2016 from Alberta and in 2017 from British Columbia etc. I was not sincere about these offers. Taking in a view the worth uses of qualifications, experience and Looking further for better future of my sons I think sincerely this time. The offer is from St john- New Brunswick.

New Bruns wick is an Atlantic province out of total 4 provinces. St john have population of 7.50 lacs approximately. The population have been deviated in last 4 years due to some unknown reasons. I have been offered 60,00 Canadian Dollar per annum from General Insurance company of St John- New Brunswick Canada.  I will be deputed at St John only. I assume that the offer is via authentic consultant of Canada. It is to be noted that nothing is written as off now. I will have to sign the bond for 2 years for the job of said company.  As per my knowledge job profile in st john is same as India. 

The role will be as collision surveyor that is my core competence.   
I have following queries:

01.At the age of 50 is it worth ACCEPTING offer???


02. Dollar 60,000 is suitable amount or I should negotiate? If alone or with family?? Dependent are wife + 15-year old son.


03. Currently I will be offered a work permit. I will be able to file P.R. after 6 months i.e. for me, my wife and my 15 years old son. The compulsory stay required in N.B. is 1000 days for getting Permanent Residence.  Are these the information appropriate???


04. What may be the expenses to be borne by us i.e. visa fees, any other fees etc.??


05. It is very difficult to adjust with cold weather of st john. Due to health issue related to weather, if we are not able to stay there after 2-3 months than how bond will be executed???

06. I will have to leave my social life, family life, business and some notional benefits too. What can be the advantage of Canada if I accept the offer.


07. Are any specialised engineering study institutes/universities being there for part time study??


08. Is the No objection certificate from wife is required as a part of process if proceeding alone for few months??? Or they demand it as extra security??


09. My son is studying in 10th Standard. Is it advisable to complete study up to 12th in India or he should study there?  

10. Is Indian food available in St-John N.B.???


11. Are there any other provisions to get the P. R. earlier??


12 My elder son is of 22 years. How can I sponsor him other than student Visa?


13. My ultimate goal is to settle in Canada with family in pleasant weather province. Please suggest place or another possible sources.

Please share any other information which are useful."," > 01.At the age of 50 is it worth ACCEPTING offer??? 

depends on what kind of life you are aiming for. there are trade-offs involved when you immigrate, so you need to look at the big picture. it's not just a financial decision, but one that involves your family, future generations, cultural changes, weather/climate changes, etc.

&#x200B;

> 03. Currently I will be offered a work permit. I will be able to file P.R. after 6 months i.e. for me, my wife and my 15 years old son. The compulsory stay required in N.B. is 1000 days for getting Permanent Residence. Are these the information appropriate??? 

Please go through the NB PNP website in great detail. Read through the entire website and the application guide, etc. Do not just trust what the consultant is telling you. The canadian immigration process is quite transparent- the process is well outlined so everything you need to know will be on their website, including forms, documents required, fees, etc. Also, from the website, it seems that NB is not accepting applications for PNP currently.

&#x200B;

> 04. What may be the expenses to be borne by us i.e. visa fees, any other fees etc.??

again, go through the NB PNP website. you'll find all the information there

&#x200B;

> 05. It is very difficult to adjust with cold weather of st john. Due to health issue related to weather, if we are not able to stay there after 2-3 months than how bond will be executed??? 

I'd suggest you pose this question in a canada immigration or legal community. In my opinion, such bonds are not enforceable in Canada, but i'm not a 100% sure

&#x200B;

> 06. I will have to leave my social life, family life, business and some notional benefits too. What can be the advantage of Canada if I accept the offer. 

Cleaner air, less crime, better work life balance, higher respect for life, effective government/ public administration systems, tax dollars that actually work and benefit residents

&#x200B;

> 08. Is the No objection certificate from wife is required as a part of process if proceeding alone for few months??? Or they demand it as extra security?? 

not sure what this certificate is but again, please go through the NB PNP site in detail. that will tell you what you need and do not need

&#x200B;

> 10. Is Indian food available in St-John N.B.??? 

most big cities in the maritimes have indian stores and restaurants. you will be able to find most spices and ingredients, but you probably won't be able to replicate your culinary preferences a 100%

&#x200B;

> 11. Are there any other provisions to get the P. R. earlier?? 

Please search ""canada express entry"" in google. that seems to be a popular PR channel these days

&#x200B;

> 13. My ultimate goal is to settle in Canada with family in pleasant weather province. Please suggest place or another possible sources. 

There are a number of options, so depends on what you're looking for. Also, i doubt if any city in canada has ""pleasant"" weather. Vancouver is probably the only city that has a slightly bearable winter.

&#x200B;

To summarize, i would say to read the NB PNP website and express entry website in detail. as i mentioned, do not just trust what the consultant is saying. do your own due diligence.

&#x200B; Kem chho Pandya kaka... I will try to answer your concerns. My background: I was 15 when my father immigrated to Canada from Vadodara.

Here are my responses:

> Dollar 60,000 is suitable amount or I should negotiate? If alone or with family?? Dependent are wife + 15-year old son.

$60,000 should give you savings (even with wife + son), but you should negotiate. Your fixed costs each month would be: rent, groceries (food), travel/commute, phone etc. For rental rates, check kijiji.ca. Groceries can be $400-500. Travel I'd say up to $200. Phone could be easily $200-$250 for 3 people. 

> Currently I will be offered a work permit. I will be able to file P.R. after 6 months i.e. for me, my wife and my 15 years old son. The compulsory stay required in N.B. is 1000 days for getting Permanent Residence. Are these the information appropriate???

Work permit and then PR sounds about right. Not sure about accuracy of the information. Try canadavisa.com forums and ask there, it is a very active community.

> What may be the expenses to be borne by us i.e. visa fees, any other fees etc.??

If you are being offered a job, the company should be taking care of any visa fees. They should even reimburse you if only the applicant is allowed to pay the visa fees by CIC. Clarify this with the company before accepting the offerf.

> It is very difficult to adjust with cold weather of st john. Due to health issue related to weather, if we are not able to stay there after 2-3 months than how bond will be executed???

I don't think companies have bonds in Canada. You can usually leave work in 2-4 weeks notice (as per terms of employment). And companies can do the same, they can let you go with the same notice. I'd recommend starting in summer so it is easier for you to adopt to the weather

> I will have to leave my social life, family life, business and some notional benefits too. What can be the advantage of Canada if I accept the offer.

Benefits:
- /u/das_halifax did a good job summarizing.

> Are any specialised engineering study institutes/universities being there for part time study??

Not sure. If you don't find much, let me know and I'll do some research for you.

> Is the No objection certificate from wife is required as a part of process if proceeding alone for few months??? Or they demand it as extra security??

Absolutely not. No NOC required from your job's wife for you to go.

> My son is studying in 10th Standard. Is it advisable to complete study up to 12th in India or he should study there?

 Best bit for you is your son is in a perfect age to hit a jackpot. As I said, I was 16 when we immigrated. Best thing is that Indian high school system is rigorous while in Canada, high school is a breeze (comparatively), while universities are a significant jump in difficulty. At your son's age, he will get a significant advantage as he would already know much of the content in Maths and Science that is taught here in Grade 11 and 12. But he has to grab the opportunity as well. If I were in India, the best I would have thought of was LD college of engineering, or MS University of Baroda, yet I was able to do Engineering from University of Toronto, which is better than any IIT. Keep in mind that he has to grab the opportunity. I had plenty of Indian friends, but almost none of them took the opportunity. I had done 11th standard in India, and had to do 11th and 12th again here. If your son studied in Gujarati medium, he might have to work hard initially. I was in English medium. If he studies all the way until 12th in India, a downside is that now Canadian universities don't know how he measures up against local applicants, and now he might be competing against International applicants. So, better if he is part of Canadian high school system before 12th. (He will likely have to give IELTS (academic module)/TOEFL regardless, btw).

> Is Indian food available in St-John N.B.???

Every small town in Canada has it. But no guarantees that you'll like the taste. Often, Indian restaurants in remote towns cater to taste buds of white people than Indians. A tradeoff of not living in Toronto, I guess.

> Are there any other provisions to get the P. R. earlier??

Try express entry. Check [CRS tool](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/skilled/crs-tool.asp) and see how much you score. As of Oct 2018, people with score of 442 were granted PR.

> 12 My elder son is of 22 years. How can I sponsor him other than student Visa?

Please don't go for student visa. You have the right thinking. People come here with admission in any random college. In Canada, college = diploma, university = degree. If he has done bachelors, and working, best bet is for him to get 2-3 years of experience and apply through express entry (try CRS tool for him as well). I know someone who immigrated recently at age of 25 and is doing pretty good. PR from day 1 and none of the struggles that people who come on student visa go through.

I don't think you can sponsor him. He has to apply by himself as he is already 21. He may get additional points if you are a PR/citizen, but not sure. You'll have to confirm with the CRS link above.

> My ultimate goal is to settle in Canada with family in pleasant weather province. Please suggest place or another possible sources.

Pleasant weather? Vancouver. But it also rains a lot in Vancouver in summer. Still better than having snow in other parts of Canada though. Vancouver is crazy expensive to live in though, because of chinese black money in real estate. Second, I'd put Toronto. Less snow than other parts of Canada, and even cities like Ottawa, Montreal. Toronto is expensive as well, but Toronto suburbs should work out well.


Concluding thoughts:
- It is a big change to move at age of 50. As you said, you are resetting your social, family life, and business. At this point, you are moving for the sake of your son than yourself. *If it was just you and kaki, I wouldn't recommend immigrating.*
- Please consider the fact that you are also subjecting your wife to a completely new environment, with no relatives around. There are a few Gujaratis in NB now (Moncton, Fredericton etc) but most are international students, so not sure how you'd relate.
- Call me emotional, but it still haunts me that my future generations won't be able to communicate with me in Gujarati if I remain in Canada the rest of my life. Not that they won't know how to, but they won't be comfortable. In 2-3 generations, the language will be wiped out from your family. Also, same thing about good values that might be unique to India. I am still not at peace with this, and am planning on returning back in a couple of years.

PM me if you'd like to discuss more. We can chat over WhatsApp if you'd like. You make the decision, but I can make you aware of all the realities based on the experience I'v gathered here in more than a decade, and that might help you make the decision. Your salary is quite low man, even for N.B. Since you are going with a teenage son, who will enter college, your wife will have to work otherwise you won't be happy at all. Incredibly paltry salary, and there are very few opportunities available in St. Johns for getting higher salary than this. That place has very high unemployment rate. Sort this aspect out, rest everything will fall in place.  I'd advice you to post this in r/canada and r/abcd as well. You might get better answers there. Having traveled to both countries.  100000 times yes 50 is 25 in Canada. You are quite the young man, sir. Good luck. r/iwantout What are you waiting for? As long as you have done homework on validating the PR in 6 months claim, what do you have to lose?  Stay there for 5 to 7 years, become a citizen, get your son a decent shot at life in Canada and if you don’t like it go back. You have worked till 50 and obviously Ahmedabad has not given you what you are looking for otherwise, you would not be thinking about leaving at this stage of life. 

As someone who left India at the age of 17, trust me when I say you will be giving your son the biggest gift any parent can give a child- a gift of choice. 

I say go ahead and don’t look back. Negotiate everything but don’t look back.  Bhaiyya kitni baar bahar gaye ho? Culture shock na ho jaye kahi sare aam chumma chaati karte logo ko dekh kar😂

And the society there is different. So be prepared that Indian way of thinking needs to be changed. 

Weather will be extremely cold compared to gujarat.  It's not worth it. You shall suffer from the lack of food, a familiar natural environment, social life et cetera. Really not a good decision."

A big thank you to all good Samaritans of r/India for their advice and feedback.

I am the ""friend"" mentioned in the original post.

My friend has given me access to this reddit account after seeing the response.

I experienced outright rejection during my recent MBA entry level job interviews due to my situation.

I was depressed, angry and confused about my future.

I was very skeptical if r/India could really help me out with my situation.

But all your feedback and suggestions, have given me a new hope.

**Original Post by my friend:**

Law graduates of r/India, Please share your views on this :

My close friend is a cancer survivor.

He is 36 years old. 

He has these two career options in mind -

(1) Whether he should get back into IT industry as he has 4.5 year's of coding experience in C#. If yes, what steps.

and

(2) Whether to pursue law as his MBA Finance has given him good exposure to Mergers And Acquisitions (M&A),  Business laws and Taxation.

I am asking your help/advice/suggestion for Query No (2) i.e, He wants to study law at the age of 36 years.

He is appearing for these law exams in 2018 -

CLAT, IIT-Kharapur's LLB entrance exam and DU LLB exam.

He says that there is no age limit for studying law and practicing law. 

Is there any merit to it ? (I don't know anything about careers after law education.)

His family supports him wholeheartedly, but they need clarity on how exactly can pursuing LLB law education help my friend at the age of 36.

Please, Please upvote for visibility.

Edit:

Being a cancer survivor, my friend was unemployed close to 3-4 years during his cancer treatment.

Recently, he secured a part time decent teaching job that can become full time.

His family is unhappy that he will resign from his present job, which he secured through lots of effort against all odds.

So, Is there any merit in his decision to take up law education at this age."," I know multiple people with MBAs and PhDs who did an LLB in their 30s and 40s to start consultancies in various business related fields. None of them are practising lawyers but doing the course opened a lot of doors in terms of career opportunities. It adds a lot to your profile, depending on what field you're trying to enter. Benefits greatly in finance, investing and startup entrepreneurship consulting.

IMO it's a great move. Luckily for your friend, this is the first year that CLAT has no age limit after the supreme court made a verdict that said so. He might have to get used to all other students being half his age! lol On a slightly different note. Such a question would've been unthinkable in a developed country. This is one area I'm genuinely envious of. There should be no prejudice about age when it comes to learning. 

I hope he does go ahead and studies. We don't have enough people actually willing to study.  > IIT-Kharapur's LLB entrance exam

IITs have Law programs too, now ? I did llb around 10 yrs back, not practicing. I had a classmate 60+, only reason he did was because he wanted to ""learn more"". Very nice person, he once fought with traffic police as his car was towed from legal parking area. Traffic constable brought back his car, and said sorry to him. 

Llb 3 years course is for those holding graduation. 5 years for 12 pass. Attending classes is compulsory if you are in good college and no one cares in many others, I had 4% in my second year. So attending evening or full time should consider the college he gets admitted too.

While studying and reading the cases is very interesting, practicing would mean spending many years with zero to very low income. Many of my friend still makes less than 10k a month. This is where top law school matters. If you are graduate of such place then getting into good law firms get easy.

I believe everyone should do Llb. No matter what you do it helps to know the law. DU law admits people only upto 30 years of age

Not sure about the IIT it doesnt have a great rep though, a law school needs years of establishment to have good faculties. Most of what Ive heard about IIT law course was the teaching is terrible  If he has ample financial reserves in the form of alternative income/rent/ancestral property, it can be a very good option. Only the very few in India can truly dedicate themselves to litigation without running after money. On the other hand if you think of making money from Law after entering it at age 36, you are likely to be disappointed.

Easy and quick money in Law is only in Transactional Law (i.e. drafting up agreements/affidavits/documents and registering them etc.) and in consultancy/advisory (eg: being on a businessman's negotiating team while he/they negotiate an agreement/merger/tie-up with a potential partner).. Transactional practice can be independent/self-employed as well, infact most low-level low-skilled independent lawyers make money through drafting agreements of leave and license, rather than appearing before a Court. You can make 30-35 K per month from drafting rent agreements and affidavits, you can barely hope to make 15 K per month from fighting cases in court. Even the better known Law Firms in Mumbai do not offer their freshers 30-35 K p.m. as starting salary.

An area in Litigation is indeed profitable but it is cornered by the niche profession of **Solicitor Firms.**   Few solicitor firms will agree to recruit someone at 36 years of age. 

The best thing is someone who owns huge profitable land/rent independently practising Law in the Courts, i.e. actually pleading before a Court. Thats how the profession used to be in Pre-Independence India. Why should there be any age limit to study. Ageism is part of casteism. I guess, there is no age limit for learning.

*For preparation of CLAT, u may suggest this free CLAT mock test site - https://www.cybermocktest.com/clat/*  If he already has masters degree why doesn't he just take a NET exam and teach? Law undergrad student from NLU Patiala, here.

I’m sure your friend has a graduation degree, so I will not suggest going for CLAT, since it is particularly for a 5 year course which is integrated course pursued by students after their 12th. The variants of these courses depending upon the NLU are BA. LL.B(hon), B.Sc. LLB, BBA LLB. etc.
5 years for a course is too much, when he can successfully pursue a 3years LL.B. degree. I will suggest checking out BVP Pune, BHU, etc.
It’s a much better utilisations of his time and resources too, given that a five-year course is very intensive with compulsory attendance and 2 lacs in fees in a year (approx.) if you consider the NLUs and other top colleges.

I would recommend a 3year course from a reputed state university over 5 year course through CLAT.
 Never too late for education and starting afresh aiming for a goal.


He'd just need to keep the eligibility criterias in check. May I know which city your friend is based out of?  In my time at law school, I have seen 40-50 somethings sitting with us 20 year old kids. 

Good thing about law is, it doesn't have age limits and or any retirement age. Some state bar councils do have 45 year age limit, I am not sure if it was challenged in court, but that's a non-issue. 

It can be a task to learn nuances and practicalities of legal practice when you're 30 plus but it's not a challenge big enough to be a roadblock for him to take up law.

Best of luck to your friend  I study in a CLAT affiliated institute. We have never had anyone his age study here. Thats because CLAT institutions don't have a 3 year LLB course. We only have a 5 year BA LLB course or a BBA LLB course. So he'll have to shift to another city for 5 years and go to class everyday with 17-18 year olds. Ask him not to give clat and research about colleges which give the LLB degree alone. For that, he should already have 
a graduate degree like BA, BSc or BBA. Many factors need to considered:


He will feel the age gap a lot, especially if in a 5 year program but also in some 3 year programs since many students join straight after college. The exception to this is probably DU and GLC, mumbai. The reason for that is attendance is not an issue and DU still has evening batches. These attract older candidates who are working during the day and also UPSC aspirants who have law as a back up. Your friend will find it easier to gel with the crowd at such places. 


Your friend might be able to continue working while studying. Even more so if it’s a teaching job and it’s part time. Those can be kind of chill and he is already working there, so cancer-based discrimination may be low. 


Regarding placements: HR recruiters will want cheap workers with no baggage. Hence, ageism crops up. Law schools (all colleges for that matter) are factories and unfortunately, your friend will be an outlier. He is highly experienced in diverse fields. This is bad and good. Recruiters won’t know what to do with him or he will get a offer appropriate for a 21 year old. It can be good if he finds a job that values his experience in B.Tech, MBA etc but that takes a lot of hustling to find. Yet he will have to explain 4 years of unemployment. Truth is, his classmates will be safer bets and his getting recruited through the formal placement process will be tough. 


Litigation stream is always an option. It’s slow work in the beginning but he’d be self employed or in a small firm.


Him being a cancer-survivor, if I were in his shoes, I’d opt for a college with chill attendance, continue with the teaching. Write the LLB exams. Build up contingencies for a cancer relapse (good insurance, access to healthcare, savings). Then carry on with life with the above priority (job with health benefits, low stress) and try to be happy. 

TLDR: technically, age is no barrier. Still, it’ll be tough. He should consider part-time and retain his day job. It is doable. Cancer changes everything. Relapse is a risk that he will have to mitigate always. [deleted]"

This is a very good initiative and deserves appreciation. 

Some suggestion:

- The current format brings attention but is not suitable to stimulate a discussion because of the wide variety of topics listed. Reddit works because each thread is about one topic (roughly put), and it attracts those who are interested in discussing that particular subject. 

- Instead of collecting everything in one single thread, I'd rather that the mods split them by topics into separate threads. 

- Personally, I feel the ""community policing"" model of reddit in general is failing because of vote manipulation by vested interests. (This initiative is a good example for this). 

- As such, I feel the mods here should be bolder - don't just help with the policing of the community but be more active contributors by becoming editors (or nominate or elect members from the community to be ""editors"").

- The task of of the ""editor"" should be as it is in any modern publication or media outlet - sift though the 100's or thousands of moderated content submitted everyday and highlight content that the r/india community should be more aware of, discuss and debate. 

- For this, the mods shouldn't be afraid to have more than 2 sticky threads on the front page. (In fact, personally I'd be comfortable with up to 5-6 stickies every day.)

- Thus stickies by community ""editors"" and the generally community contributed upvoted / debated content on the front page should make things more interesting here and also help more in creating harder to manipulate community with better content.

------------

Edit: On more thought, a simpler approach initially, could be to link to the relevant topic threads  here directly instead of linking to the news sources directly. While it would mean we have to click twice to read an article, but it would also stimulate discussion on the topic and address part of the problem I originally highlighted.

https://np.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fl0pdv/mark_cuban_says_bailed_out_companies_should_never/

The execs of the top US companies who have tonnes of money as it is , I'm not sure exactly, but messed up. Didn't save any money, kept reinvesting profits in their own stocks so that company value goes up and now are basically going through heavy losses and have put the jobs of citizens at risk plus they want the government to use taxpayer money to bail them out.

And from what I gather these companies will remain privatised and won't be nationalised.

There is an uproar within the US against this and a comment I really liked stated ""Why should the profits be privatised and losses be socialised"" 

Anyway, I want to know what the policies are like in India. If India has similar policies and private companies in India will go through the same thing?

What are the policies Indian government in similar situations? Is buying your own stock also legal in India? 

If someone could also explain the situation in US and in similar context the Indian economy and situation. That will be greatly appreciated.

My grandparents are farmers in Andhra Pradesh.
He harvest 25 acres of land. In the past decade itself, I have not seen a single rice crop being harvested properly. There are at a stage where even in rural areas they need to buy rice.

When there is a good crop, the prices are down. 
They sell at 25kgs for ₹600-800. While in Delhi I buy at ₹2500/-. I can't understand this gross miscalculation. Farmer isn't getting it and we as a consumer paying more than thrice of it.

Coming to Auto sector, ""Maruti"" doesn't produce world class products in India. Taking an example of Swift model. There are many differences in Indian version and overseas version. So, if the sales slump in domestic market they can't even push it to overseas. It's a high time for these companies to produce high quality products. 

This government doesn't even know basic economics. How will they? They don't have even one person who has a sound market knowledge.

For a person who had invested 5-6 years back in a stock, he or she had lost an opportunity profit but nothing was ever promised. That's why all these instruments come with terms and conditions.

If a share falls by 30% that doesn't mean that a company with really good fundamentals and performance track will lose 30% of their intrinsic value over minutes. On the other hand if a company was extremely leveraged and had pre-existing skeletons in the closet, it""s going to be horrible for them. This time is more of a period of companies opening up and being honest about their positions and less of a China propoganda or lockdown bad thing.

It's sad to see people lose their jobs but it doesn't matter weather 1 million lose their jobs every year or 6 mill in one freak event but it was going to happen eventually. There is a fundamental demand side shock that has happened in India tracing far back as 2016. It's ironic that the enemies and black money hoarders of the economy, the informal sector, your vegetable vendors, your kirana shops your local chai walla, are currently the world managing and actually saving local district microeconomic commerce with their supply chains and flexibility. 

Right now the world is in an icu and we are paying a massive hospital bill not because of the disease but because of lack of investment in the essentials like infrastructure, healthcare and education. The investment was directed towards other fancier things because it seemed cool or a matter of izzat to do so at the time. I hope after all this is done people don't forget about the local kirana shops and supply chain guys who managed to keep things running."," Actually, corona virus is a great excuse for bjp to blame all their economical problems on. Now, for the next few years any question on economy will be diverged to blame corona virus. Like, how they blame 70 years of congress for most of Indias problems. Well written thoughts. 

This Corona Virus outbreak is a Godsend for this government to bury all their misgovernance and failures in economic policies in deep. 

When we recover from this virus, still they can continue to blame on the Virus until next General Election announced, and during that time the Islamic Monster will suddenly appear from BJP closets.

Not only has yes bank failed but with Supreme court order on Vodafone AGR dues, this is likely to cause over 20,000 crore of NPAs on top banks, including SBI and IndusInd. It wont be surprising to see another bank fail and get saved by cashpayers money.

Moreover Vodafone a large international company failing due to GOI greed will be death knell of foreign investments into India. Imagine a govt so careless they allow such a large company such as vodafone to go bankrupt due to utter stupid policies. This govt has managed to destroy one of the most promising sectors telecom into a duopoly.

Even liquid funds are crashing hard as even GOI defaulting cannot be ruled out at this point. Lot of RBI money has gone into cleaning up the mess created by DeMo, GST, saving private banks, etc. While other countries are announcing several billion dollars of corona relief, there is nothing really left in terms of relief to Indian citizens.


During recession, you need actual economists like Manmohan Singh and Raghuram Rajan steering the ship, not war mongers like Anurag Thakur and Nirmala tai.

It's just sane idiots like us who will die screaming at his/her own misfortune to be alive to see a rising country being pulled down to the rubbles. Now that Corona virus is there to take all the blame, otherwise we would have had a 5-trillion economy before 2024 ! 2020s are going to be a completely lost decade for India. We'll be lucky to get out of lower middle income status. The sad thing is the govt will piggyback on the corona virus reason for the next 3 years for all the economic downturn- and trust me bhakts will buy it. I follow Indian markets for work and stuff.
Your govt has been giving tax benefits and stuff to the stock markets for some years now at the cost of a deficit budget.

Now in the face of a pandemic, things are go to shit.

Knowing politicos as they are, they will probably put up a smokescreen and try to distract over some useless stuff.

The only thing India has going for it roght now economically is that the crude oil has crashed while domestic rates have still been kept up through taxes which should help their budget

Edit: oh yeah and i forgot about the gst and demonitizibg debacle. That threw a cog in your machine too I believe it's a feature not a bug.

And yes - the Govt is fully prepared to handle such or more emergencies.  And dare you resist Corona cess (like Kargil cess) which will be surreptitiously introduced like excise tax increment on fuel and increase in GST on certain products and 5 folds increase on platform tickets. It speaks a lot about our economy when India’s 4th most popular bank faces problems like this. Yeah, I'm not m expecting any improvement in the economy until 2027. Even if we have the sense to vote in a non BJP govt in 2024, it will take them a few years to repair the damage What recession?

/s I see lot of trolls and  complaints,  can we have productive alternatives to this for 2024 and above ? Mera Desh Badal raha hai Ulta chal raha hai Dogger modi I agree with what you said. Just mind well, using a language like ""Dear Sanghi morons"" only divides us further. I support no party. But, from my observation I feel everyone around me cheers for a political party as if they are Football clubs. Hooligans have a very different mentality, the more you alienate or single them out, the more moronic they'll act.

Problem is - we keep a party accountable not the position, not the entire body. We don't try to regulate and hold public forums to make sure right steps are being taken. Since fandom drives votes (or hacked EVMs), people who want progress can't do shit.

It's hard to fix, but unity and making everyone understand the big picture would be your first step. Not saying ""moron"" :)

If you ever managed large number of teams. You'd deal with under performers, critics, cynics, go getters,  etc - driving a change in such an environment requires openness, collaboration, incremental education and then subsequent lifts. Once those processes are in place, you feel that those that aren't contributing (cynics, people that are negative, etc) realize that their opinion isn't right and they shut up automatically. I think that's what our country needs right now.

You bring those ""morons"" in your community. Ask them to help work with you on a cause, test it incrementally and then move towards what works best. Everyone walks out happy. Denial is bad thing atleast they could accept things have gone bad It's not just Indian government. The whole world is not prepared for such an incident. I personally expected the economic bubble to burst for two years now. This time it happened due to a pandemic. The repercussions will be extreme and as usual the big businesses will be bailed out by the banks and government. 

The only solution for us Indians would be to -
1. Pay off all debts
Move from a debt economy to a savings based economy. The ones that our grandparents followed. 
2. Decentralisation
Power and opportunities should not get concentrated in big cities. There is pollution, population, lack of resources and chaos. We need to distribute industries and opportunities across towns and villages where people will no longer have to move to the city for a job. At least we are not being run by scam artists.
Economic development > economic growth
I hate how you all are willing to go back to the scam era of India. Downvote me all you want. You just support the  evil gandu family. I hope you love your dreams of nepotism. Rip me out all you want, the truth hurts. You are a fool if you think governments have anything to do with this pandemic. All governments of the world at puppets of the corporations and bankers. Grow balls and think critically. Vodafone related deal is not related to GoI greed, it started from 2007 with Hutchinson Essar, both Congress and BJP governments have maintained same position. It has something to do related to transaction made in tax heavens being liable to taxation if business is in India. 

I know some people don't like Modi or some people don't like Pappu, but understanding the situation is also important."

I replied without reading this person's entire post - which turned out to be trolling. So I'm reposting my comment here. It starts with some historical background, and ends with a comparative description of how other countries have performed.

---

**My Answer:** Clothes and Shoes

1. **Industrialization**: Historically, models of industrialisation have followed two pathways:
 * *Slow but Steady:* Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. This helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weak.
 * *Accelerated Growth:* economic successes mostly in East Asia began authoritarian, explicitly (Korea, China) or de facto (Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan), and gave way to political transformation only after a degree of economic success was achieved.

2. **Where does India Stand**: India has attempted economic development while also granting universal franchise from the very beginning. The only other countries in this group are Botswana, Mauritius, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Costa Rica — all perennial democracies. At independence, India was one of the poorest nations, regardless of political system, with a per capita GDP of just $617 (PPP). This implies:
 * The Indian state has been ever burdened by the demands for redistribution since early in its life - leading to the poor state capacity we see today (healthcare, education, law enforcement).
 * There is a distrust of the Private Sector and over-reliance on Public capacity.
 * 'Exit', that is, winding down, declaring bankruptcy, and plugging inefficiencies is hard because of diverse stakeholders, vested interests, and poor institutions

3. **What Kind of Jobs does India Need:**  India needs to generate jobs that are formal and productive, provide bang-for-buck in terms of jobs created relative to investment, have the potential for broader social transformation, and can generate exports and growth. Apparel and Footwear sectors fit this bill.

4. **How have Apparel and Footwear worked for the East Asian Economies?** In the successful East Asian economies, countries where GDP growth booms averaged between 7-10 per cent, growth in the exports of these two sectors was exceptional. For comparison, over a 20 year period ""post-liberalisation"" for each economy:
 * Country|Year of Take-Off|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Apparel|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Leather and Footwear|Annual avg economic growth for 20 years post take off (per cent)|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
Korea|1962|30.4|69.9|9.0|
BGL|1985|27.9|29.8|5.2|
Thailand|1960|53.8|44.1|7.5|
Indonesia|1967|65.8|48.6|7.0|
Malaysia|1970|33.4|27.5|6.9|
China|1978|18.6|27.7|9.8|
Vietnam|1985|17.8|16.1|6.6|
India|1980|12.7|5.4|5.6|

5. **Why has India under-performed?** For a lot of historical, religious, and socio-cultural reasons. However, those pertinent to contemporary times include:
 * *Logistics*: Costs and Time for getting goods from factory-to-port are greater. Furthermore, Indian ports are unequipped to handle very large capacity containers. We use Sri Lankan ports for such transshipments.
 * *Labor Regulations*: Labor costs are low, but regulations strangulate formalization because of high overtime pay requirements, de facto EPF contribution taxes for low-paid workers, and inflexible firing policies.

 * *Tax and Tariff Policies*: India's domestic tax policies and unbalanced in that they promote cotton-based fibres instead of man-made fibres, which is the bulk of the global demand. Similarly, the global demand is for non-leather footwear, while India's share of global exports in leather footwear are double that of non-leather footwear (ie. it wrongly focuses on leather footwear)

 * *Export Market Discrimination*: EU and US impose customs tariffs on Indian apparel and footwear exports at ~10%, while it is 0% for Bangladesh. So Indian firms shift operations outside of India.

**What should India do? / What is it doing?** I'll add in this later if I see this post getting enough traction. Writing all of this took a lot of time in and of itself. If you have any suggestions, write away in the comments!"," There's a great recent episode on Rajya Sabha TV's ""State of the Economy"" where they discuss employment in India. It's just 24 minutes(skip the first 2 minutes of intro) and really goes into depth, yet in an accessible way.

 Some really interesting contributions here already. There is one crucial sector we might be overlooking though - public sector jobs, especially police, judiciary and healthcare workers. 

This is important, firstly, because most of our public services are so understaffed. There is massive log jamming in the judiciary for instance, scant police coverage in most areas, absolute lack of healthcare facilities in a large part of the country. An efficient economy can only be built in the foundation of a well functioning polity. A healthier, safer society is an absolute necessity for a healthy economy. 

Secondly, having more public sector jobs ends up creating more private jobs, especially in the service economy. 

The problem we run into when speaking of public sector is jobs is financing. This is a big problem. I believe fully staffing our public services is an investment. We don't question the need for physical infrastructure, we shouldn't for well staffed public services. Also, it's high time we did something about the shameful legacy of the past - housing our netas in palatial bungalows, the most expensive real estate in the country. Sell of Lutyens Delhi babu bungalows, create a fund, invest in human capital.  This should be a sticky post Economic Survey this year had a separate chapter on clothes and shoes, you should read that. EU Resident here. Most of the top quality branded clothes (hoodies, tshirts and jeans) we wear here and houseries (including IKEA) are actually made in Bangladesh.

If anyone can supply these products with same quality and similar price, I can create a few jobs in India. Good start. Admins should close the other troll/genocide thread. 

I'll try to divide my reply in two parts. The first where I reply to some of your points and the second where I'll try to write up some new parts which you didn't touch on.
__________________________________________________________

**First part**

> Slow but Steady: Western Economies

> Accelerated Growth: East Asia

This is actually somewhat inaccurate. As Dani Rodrik and many others have pointed out, *there has only been one single path to prosperity* for large economies which can't rely on fossil fuels or on tourism(like Trinidad and Tobago). That's the path of export-led manufacturing growth. 

Most people mistakenly think this is the ""East Asian"" model but this was how the UK, Germany and France all developed. Same is true with the US. Manufacturing was a huge part of the US economy up until perhaps the 1970s. 

Some people claim India can't replicate this model for two reasons. The first is automation/AI, which limits employment opportunity. The second is slow trade/protectionism. I'll be brief on both.

As far as AI/Automation is concerned, a lot of people have to understand that plenty of jobs that were counted as manufacturing in the past were actually service sector jobs. It's just that they were in the factory back in the old days. Today everything is hyper-specialised, so a lot of those jobs have moved out but are so-called ""auxiliary services"". They don't get counted with manufacturing today, but they should. If they were, job losses aren't nearly as bad as it's made out to be.

As for trade/protectionism is concerned, it's true that the world economy is growing slower than during the boom times, but historical perspective is needed. The average growth during the 1990s was slower than what the world economy is growing at right now. Korea, Taiwan and the other Asian tigers as well as Ireland and some Eastern European nations(Poland, Slovakia etc) had very rapid growth during this period, despite generally low global growth. So, I think this excuse doesn't really hold today. Yes, the opportunities are lower than in the 2000s, but from a historical perspective they are slightly above average.  Sadly our focus has been on cotton and yarn exports. At best fabrics and some niches like home textiles. We haven't been able to crack the apparels segment.

Our largest textile companies (measured in terms of investment or market cap) are yarn companies or home fabrics companies. 

In footwear we could have an edge in leather footwear, but this beef ban thing could be a detterant.  /u/ringtring your original post is good but I would like to point that Thailand, BGL(Bangladesh?), Malaysia and Indonesia are not under East Asia but under ASEAN. Few points.  

> Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. 

Semantic use of the term *in tandem* is not accurate enough plus the timelines are so broad they are meaningless.  

Using such broad terms one can even say that South Korea developed under this slow western model because it changed its system before it had become developed.  

The fact is the political development is a spectrum in itself and the West like US esp. was on the end of this spectrum closer to everyone else who developed than on the other end of it, where basically no one exists.  
Meaning, no one has ever developed under a democracy. And since democracies are of various types we need to provide context for it and that context was provided. Things like universal suffrage is a basic and easy metric(India is an older proper democracy than US in this manner), other can be used as well like the power holdings among a few rich homogeneous elites even despite the voting rights.  

As for the point on why India has under-performed.  

The fundamental reasons are that India has not followed the general path that leads to development. There is no Universal model for it but there are certain practices which are near-universal meaning they are de facto pre-requisite requirements.  

Things like having an Infrastructure in place before you set up a secondary and tertiary sector like Services and R&D.  
This a a dynamic which goes even beyond Industrialization. There is no development and stability without Infra development. Roads were the first things a new empire build.  
Then at the same time as this is Land reforms, its another prerequisite. There are plenty of evidence for this with countries that developed in the 20th century.  

Everything else comes afterwards. India is accumulating factors which are exceptional, things like Democracy from the get go, Tertiary sector before Infrastructure. Land reform not even done barring few places like Kerala.  

Its no wonder things wouldn't be smooth sailing. 

And about What India needs.  
I am of a different view. India should help where the people are and they are in the Primary sector, they are farmers. That is where the labor force is. Help them and you solve multiple problems. Problems like lack of jobs if everyone over the coming generations is supposed to enter the job pool. Problems like not enough capital for other major works which will become obsolete (exclusive factories are not a sound long term gambit). Problems like uprooting people in a country like India which is unique in terms of its diversity and already having massive population density issues.  

Helping the people in the agriculture sector is the biggest bang for the buck. It helps bring the HDI levels up, it helps the social security dynamic. It helps in the balanced development of all/majority people argument.   

Currently though there is no proper model for it. And this is where my views are different than most. India is already doing things in its own way. It is already the exception. It should look for new models of growth instead of relying on pre-exiting ones which may or may not really be that effective at the stage India is in. No model is universal, they have to be fitted to the place they are being implemented in. India should look for solutions which are novel and unique to its situation.   

Currently though India seems to have picked the same model of growth that has been used by majority of the world and that is Rapid Growth through fast tracked Urbanization. 10 years back Indian urbanization rate was less than 20%, now its reaching mid 30's.  
To me this goes against the India ethos and even practically its not sound for India given its unique spread of population over a smaller area and stressed natural resources.   When Koreans/Chinese started to make toys to be sold in the west, they never knew they would become some one like this. Indian ways of growing is not faulty, it can be considered as a new way. We have a lot problems which most previous governments ignored and China/Korea/US gave a lot of importance during early industrialization.

Industrialization needs infrastructure, skilled worker and rule of law which are missing in India.

* We have a pathetic infrastructure. Because the government doesn't want to anger people and politicians have a huge interest in infrastructure building, we could not build everything very quickly. Roads/Bridges/Ports/Railways are very slow and inefficient. Most people will not leave land easily. The environment must be protected. The contractors also make a lot of money by building everything slowly and of bad quality.

* Rural education is in a very bad condition. Most factory workers, construction crew usually come from rural areas. In India, most of them are very unskilled and difficult to be trained.

* Inefficient governance is also another reason. Our state is very backward. It takes days for people to get the documents and months for companies. Bureaucrats usually don't work for people unless someone attacks them. Law enforcement is also very bad. 

 This post and the discussion that it brought fold is gold! I've been through the entire thread and this is some real quality discussion. Thanks to everyone who contributed to the discussion. ☺️ Reading it has been a pleasure. 

It's disheartening that the comments don't have as many points and the ones in the political threads do.  One area prime for reforms and job creation I feel is agriculture. I think India is employing a huge proportion of it's population in farming and yet it's very inefficient, maybe the latter is the cause for former. I think agriculture can be leveraged to bring jobs to rural areas bu investing in rural infrastructure creation, warehouses and storage, distribution and transportation and food processing. This coupled with building human resource capital in rural and semi-urban areas be it teachers. public transportation workers, support personnels etc. 

Manufacturing should be our main focus and we should focus on both domestic oriented and export oriented manufacturing.  >  Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. This helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weak.

As far as UK is concerned, what period was the capacity weak & when did it become strong? I don't think India has an  unemployment problem It just has people who don't want to work.  "

And 2020 kao utlook abhi se itna gulaabi lag raha hai ke poocho mat. Modi - apun ko land pharak nahi padta.. Chaa.... Ntrial secretariat pe hai apun The right question to ask is ""Does he care?"" CNBC international put out a video regarding this on their YouTube channel. I would recommend everyone to watch it who wants to understand the issue with a *briefly* greater depth because our own media surely won't educate you on that. BJP doesn't know the way out of this because they've always lacked intellectual capacity. 

Their best bet is to ride the wave of polarization or hope the economy just bounces back on 'animal spirits' of India Inc Not going to lie. I knew this would be unearthed sooner or later. Because for the entirety of December and I know because I run a restaurant, compared to last year there was no business. And this was not just my opinion. Rather the opinion or many friends if mine too who run the  restaurant business. I knew this would happen. He is watching and he doesn't seem to care, bjp has a different agenda, Ram Mandir, CAA,NRC, UCC,  re-writing the Constitution, removing all reservations, making India a Hindu-Rashtra  and such.

He is hoping / believing that once all these steps are taken, Ram Rajya will usher in and all will be prosperous and happy.

For all we know, he may be right ! Don't wanna sound like bhakt but wasn't the economy before Dr. Manmohan Singh's epic liberalisation of Indian economy in 1992 even worse. If i remember correctly , we were on verge on economic collapse prior to 1991ish. Dr Manmohan Singh literally saved our asses then. Anti national certificate for Forbes incoming Can anyone tell me what measures a middle-class investor should take to brace himself for the inevitable recession? Worst by western standards. Those standards don’t apply here. Have you even polled the cows in UP? Gujrat model my ass Nehru etc etc. Indira and Rajiv etc etc. Scams etc etc Mahatma Gandhi was Muslim supporter etc etc world Mein kharab haalat hain Modi is not responsible etc etc... Every developing country goes through this etc et c.

Let me know bhakts if u have any other argument A google search for “Forbes modi” sorted ascending by time makes for a lovely sequence starting with euphoria, confirmation bias, falling for their PR, cautionary words of advice to straight out “this is a disaster” now He is busy getting narcisssittic orgasms from the bhakts."
656,Policy/Economy,"Salary-earners pay highest per cent of income in taxes, get little in return and see their tax rupee get used for votes",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-edit-page/indias-much-abused-taxpayers-you-dont-get-much-benefit-back-salaried-classes-get-the-short-end-of-the-stick,," Unfortunately salary earners are also the demographic that votes the least It's incredible that this doesn't boil the blood of the salaried middle class. Even when it does, the anger gets manifested as ""fuck taxes"" and ""fuck socialist policies"".

I mean if we were actually living in a half decent socialist or even social democratic country, we would have shit like quality public health care and education, potable tap water, public toilets, and so forth. Hell for the amount of toll we pay everytime we drive out of the city, we should be cruising on Autobahns at this point. 

Instead we spend thousands of bucks on RO cleaning ""drinking water"" (which is taxed again), and now we spend thousands on air purifiers for clean air. Seriously, what the fuck. 

We pay a shit ton of taxes and we get nothing. Where does the money go? This shit impacts you on a daily basis. Why aren't you angry? And even if you are, why does it only manifest itself as anger against Pakistan/Muslims/Lefties/Villain-of-the-day?

We really have nothing to lose but our chains. But all we have lost is our minds. It’s because white income is easy to tax. Really takes effort to curb real tax evasion by the trader and informal class of people. Same
Shit happens with every government. I think it is a miracle that a country where earning $500/mo puts you in the 1% bracket, is not full blown socialist jab tankha leta hoon to aisa lagta hai ki modi ji saath khadey hain meri tankha baatney All hail socialist policies! Doesn't this actually bolster the idea that one shouldn't own a car privately but put more trust in car-sharing and ride-hailing? Yeh gormint bik gayi hai!"
657,Policy/Economy,Rant: When will the Supreme Court finally intervene to stop the madness of Modi and his arbitrary demonetisation policies? It is killing the economy at an astounding rate.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5j5wkd/rant_when_will_the_supreme_court_finally/,"The entire process has been flawed and still they haven't done anything to stop his madness, including the new ruling notification by the RBI today.

Can you imagine the fury if they cancel this? All these people lost time and business/jobs for nothing. [deleted] Sc cannot intervene in each and every matter of the government. If can only observe and comment on it. If they start to intervene then what will be use of government.
Legislature and Judiciary have their own boundaries.. 10 more fucking days I don't think they can do anything more than give their opinion about it. Either way they're busy with more important stuff like forcing patriotism in movie halls. Is it killing the economy if a majority disagrees and would be willing to beat you up over it? Is a fact a fact if no one around you agrees to it?

Modi era has made me definitely more philosophical. Only when a judge from SC gets a lot of their money stuck due to de-monet. I think between SC and Modi, the latter is still wiser at the moment no matter what your standings leanings are. You might not agree with demonetization. But SC (judicative!) making the rules (legislative!) about national anthem is just unacceptable. The government (Modi) might have executive orders with temporary effect. But SC is totally insane at the moment. Honestly pipe down, it'll be over in 10 days, I can already see things normalising around me > Killing the economy at an astounding rate  
  
What is your quantification of economy and how is that being killed at an astounding rate?  
(Anecdotes don't count, since we are talking about a rate after all..)
   > It is killing the economy at an astounding rate.

Can you put some data to substantiate. Most economists expect a 1% growth hit at the max.  SC has no power as we have clearly seen. There is no proper separation of powers. This %hit continue Hopefully never."

EDIT:Some of you think all the fuck ups that are brewing are my fault just because i once voted for modi.We didn't know that this was going to happen.We chose a narcissist over a retard.We rode the wave like many others.So don't act all high and mighty .If you knew this was going to happen,where were you back in 2014 and 2019 huh?Its easy to talk big when its all said and done.Its better to look for an alternative rather than playing the blame game.



EDIT 2 : i have come to the conclusion that most of you find the fact and reason that i voted for modi hard to swallow.Yes i admit that i made a mistake when i thought he is a Guju and he might have a business plan for our country.Turns out he did have business plans but only for Ambani.It was ignorance on my part when i thought the 2002 incidents were not Modi's fault.Most of his other policies were not well thought and anti Muslim.You can all blame me for voting for Modi and still be chin deep in shit or Give reasonable contentions that might help.i personally don't like the idea of voting for Rahul.But now if i had to,i would choose Rahul over Modi.But wouldn't it be better if congress chose a new PM candidate like Tharoor.I have a hunch that Modi will not be around for long.Aggressive sophomaniac piece of shits need not reply."," It's too late now... don't you think? Dude imagine it's just the first year of his second term; and so much has happened. 4 years are still remaining I'm scared as fuck. Stop crying for daddy.  We wanted a suppository from decisive leader modi and he has been giving us doses like demo, gst, balakot CAA and now this. You will take this diblopment and keep voting for him or the next cattle bothered in 2024 while crying about how there is no other choice. Fuck you. Go back to WhatsApp. ""Rode the wave"" my ass. You knew this was coming. And believe me, you will be voting for Modi again in 2024. Sorry, brother. Modi has just about started with you and Shah is still lubing up. Yogi and others are in line too. You don't get to leave now till you get your vote's worth. Enjoy! ""I think Rahul Gandhi is stupid so I will vote for a party of murdering bigots""

Some of ya'll really dont have a sense of depth Manmohan Singh is 87 years old. If I were in his place, I would have shown middle finger to Indians and gone to some foreign country. We don't deserve him. You made it happen. 

Everyone knew it, BJP would enable this eventually. Still, people like you vote for him. 

But, good on you that you realized. “We didn’t know this was going to happen?”

Sorry, ignorant morons like you are the ones who enabled all of this to happen in the first place. 

You voted for development and casually chose to ignore incidents like 2002 and now you’re ranting about this? Good luck. It's Dr Manmohan Singh, not Mr. 😒 Are you from the same constituency as narendra ? Since you want a logical answer here it goes. 

India is a massive country which makes slow and steady progress. We move slowly and that is because we have a lot of inertia. But once we start moving, it is difficult to stop us. We didn't move our asses for close to 2 centuries to send off the Brits, but once we got together, it didn't take too long. This characteristic of ours carries on and is seen in our parliament. Bills take too long to go through and there is opposition from every group (logical because everyone has their own perspective). But once the discussions are done, implementation becomes easy. 

And this tardiness is hated by our generation. We need things to move fast and lack patience. So when we saw UPA going slow with the bills and everything, the hope of a strong leader who can hasten things was sold to people. And we lapped it up. However, we forgot that Indian politics runs on fake promises. We were given images of Gujarat's development, but few even bothered to check whether Modi was the guy who did it. (Fun fact: He wasn't). Thus, our newfound hope, Modi become the PM who would deliver us unto the New India. Nobody paid attention to the 2002 riots or maybe they thought he would have learnt from his mistakes. But lest we forget, it is the RSS that holds the reins now. 


I am okay with you if you voted for him in 2014. If you did vote for him in 2019, you better get off your arse and protest like there is no tomorrow for you fell for the rhetoric of patriotism.

Edit: Congress can do whatever the fuck they want (like sticking with Pappu). Similarly, you can do whatever the fuck you want. You can go protest or spread the truth about this government or work for the development of the society. The choice is yours. Even an Ape is better than Modi as the PM as long it doesn't make the citizens kill each other. How about Shashi tharoor? Rahul Gandhi is not a retard. Narendra Modi's problem is not that he is a narcissist. His problem is that he is a terrorist. Anyone is better that Modi. Especially Rahul. He would actually listen to others such as MMS. People who voted for modi for the second time are the worst. I would give the first time a pass because he was promising development. The second time only thing he promised was this and that's why they are the worst. They knew what he stood for they knew how crooked and dumb he was rafale, demo etc all happened the first term. They only way these people could get worse is saying stuff like Rahul is bad. You guys choose modi after you knew what he did and what he was capable of. Everybody knew this was going to happen especially in 2019. Everybody knows what the rss is. Everyone knew about the 2002 riots. And everyone knew all the bs about Rahul  was just pr. And you believed all that and still do. His quote ""History will be kinder to me than the contemporary media and the opposition parties in parliament"" has never been so damn true. Let's be realistic. He is very old. There are many talented people in congress too. I sincerely hope tharoor's rebel against gandhi family succeed. Not that Rahul gandhi is all bad. But BJP has made his such image so that it is very unlikely for public to support him over few years. He should accept it and keep low profile for few years. Voting for Modi in 2014 is forgivable but not in 2019. If you voted in 2014, then you should be fine. Koi lautaa de mere beete hue din ! Btw Manmohan Singh's term was the highest on corruption. There were new scandals every day. I don't know which one was worse.

Congress let all their minister loot the whole country. Now they victim-blame all the time. They could have done something good, but they didn't. They are the reason for their demise Modi is our only hope peoples of India ... He is your saviour this man has the power to liberate the country from the 800 years long slavery by those foreign powers ... This is your only chance to ride the wave and demolish the empire of those growing powers and bring back the ancient and long gone glory of this nation and it's people.... 
।। नमो नमो ।। We could have Arvind Kejriwal as our PM but nobody voted for him.

I know he was not perfect. But he improved a lot over the years with experience. Most importantly he is a decent person at heart.

More of us should give young politicians/parties a chance rather than voting based on religion."
659,Policy/Economy,An Honest Conversation About Demonetization,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fzs3p8/an_honest_conversation_about_demonetization/,"***Long Post Warning***

Please note I'm only looking at the big picture. I'm not trying to minimize the suffering of lakhs, just want to get an overall view of DeMo and its effects on the economy, black money and the tax base.

**The Good:**

* Under the new Amnesty scheme,  ₹4900 crores of unaccounted income was declared by around 21000 people. (Source - [Rs 4,900 crore black money disclosed under PMGKY, Rs 2,451 crore tax collected from it)](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/black-money-rs-4900-crore-disclosed-under-pmgky-rs-2451-crore-tax-collected-income-tax/story/259891.html)
* Over 2 lakh shell companies (corporations that exists only on paper and are often linked to money laundering and movement of black money) were struck off by the government, rendering them illegal. (Source - [India Cancels 2.24 Lakh Suspected Shell Companies Post Demonetisation](https://www.bloombergquint.com/law-and-policy/india-cancels-224-lakh-suspected-shell-companies-post-demonetisation))
* In similar but separate action, around 3.09 lakh board of directors were disqualified for their companies failing to file financial statements and/or annual reports for a continuous period of three financial years. (Source - [Govt cancelled 2.24 lakh suspected shell companies post demonetisation, disqualified 3.09 lakh directors](https://www.firstpost.com/business/govt-cancelled-2-24-lakh-suspected-shell-companies-post-demonetisation-disqualified-3-09-lakh-directors-4194085.html))
* 48 per cent increase in deposits in Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) accounts, with addition of 18 million accounts post-demonetisation (November 9 to January 25, 2017). The latest data indicate that 38.2 million new accounts were opened until July 26, 2017 since demonetisation. (Source - [Demonetisation and Bank Deposit Growth](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/MSM_Demonetisation.aspx))
* India witnessed a great jump in the account ownership during 2014-2017 as 80 percent Indians owned a bank account in 2017; there were only 35 percent bank account holders in 2011. Please note this is in(significant) part due to the PMJDY accounts. (Source - [55 percent of all new bank accounts in the world opened from India: Global Findex Report 2017](https://www.jagranjosh.com/current-affairs/19-crore-indian-adults-do-not-have-bank-accounts-global-findex-report-2017-1524203973-1))
* Several measures taken to improve transparency in the gold market, including GST have seen a shift from off-book transactions to accounted transactions (Source - [Demonetisation, GST impact: India is fast ceding gold market share to China](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/demonetisation-gst-impact-india-is-fast-ceding-gold-market-share-to-china-118050300388_1.html))
* Much more transparency in the real estate segment which is rife with black money dealings. DeMo paved the way for new acts such as the RERA which further increase transparency. The immediate drop in the prices in real estate (\~30%) can be attributed to black money not playing such a big part anymore (Source - [Demonetisation impact: Real estate sector still recovering from the jolt](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/real-estate/demonetisation-impact-real-estate-sector-still-recovering-from-the-jolt-2432723.html)). The real estate segment seems to recovering from the jolt, but now with much higher accountability. (Source -  [Impact of demonetisation on real estate recedes](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/impact-of-demonetisation-on-real-estate-recedes-117061400058_1.html))
* Direct Tax collection has increased siginificantly due to DeMo. Corporate income tax grew at 14% and Personal income tax grew at 13%. Net collections increased by 17.1% in FY18 and 14.6% in FY17, despite income tax rates staying mostly the same in the last couple of years. Since the note ban, direct tax buoyancy doubled from 0.6 times in FY16 to 1.3 times in FY17 and accelerated further to 1.7 times in FY18.  (Source - ['Direct tax collection up since demonetisation'](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/direct-tax-collection-up-since-demonetisation/articleshow/69077749.cms) and [What demonetisation did to tax collections](https://www.thehindu.com/business/what-demonetisation-did-to-tax-collections/article23550004.ece))

**The Bad:**

* Labourers in the textile, footwear, plastic and metal industry have been adversely affected by the demonetisation move.Labourers in the organised and unorganised sectors bore the biggest brunt of this move. In the time since the note-ban, over 50 lakh men have lost their jobs. The unemplyment rate hit a 45-year high of 6.1 percent in 2018. (Source - [50 lakh people lost jobs since demonetisation, says Azim Premji University report](https://www.businesstoday.in/sectors/jobs/50-lakh-people-lost-jobs-since-demonetisation-says-azim-premji-university-report/story/337980.html))
* In the immediate aftermath of DeMo, MSME's were the most badly affected. Small businesses with no access to PoS machines suffered during the immediate aftermath. This inadvertently led to the bigger players overpowering the market. (Source - [Demonetisation: Indian SMEs suffered a blow, still struggling to find their footing](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/demonitisation-indian-smes-suffered-a-blow-still-struggling-to-find-their-footing/articleshow/61541952.cms?from=mdr))
* The manufacturing segment was hit pretty hard. The Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) fell to 49.6, indicating a contraction. Cash flow issues battered the entire sector, leading to lower employment, reduction in production activity and rise in input costs. The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) saw just a 4.9% growth in November, compared to 6.6 percent in October. (Source - [Demonetisation hits manufacturing sector](https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/Demonetisation-hits-manufacturing-sector/article16979062.ece))
* Agriculture was one of the worst hit sectors. The Ministry of Agriculture acknowledged that due to the lack of cash, millions of farmers were unable to purchase seeds and fertilisers ahead of the rabi season. Due to the shortage of cash, about 1.38 lakh quintals of wheat seeds of the national seed corporation were not even sold. Sale, transport, marketing and distribution of ready produce to wholesale centres or mandis, is dominantly cash-dependent. Disruptions, breaks in the supply chains feedback to farmers as sales fall, increased wastage of perishables, lower revenues that show up as trade dues instead of cash in hand and when credited into bank accounts with limited access affect the sector. Incomes and profit margins were hit hard. (Source - [Demonetization: The impact on agriculture](https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/B1vFTOgwqHjdM5nkmg2CxJ/Demonetization-The-impact-on-agriculture.html))
* The rural and informal economy suffered disproportionately as most of the transactions are cash-based. The pile up at wholesale markets lead to a sharp decline in the Wholesale price index (WPI) of perishables in the immediate aftermath of DeMo. (Source - [How demonetisation affected the Indian economy, in 10 charts](https://www.livemint.com/Politics/ySbMKTIC4MINsz1btccBJO/How-demonetisation-affected-the-Indian-economy-in-10-charts.html))
* A systemic liquidity crunch was created due to the note ban leading to massive disruption in the supply and demand of several goods. The performance of the equity markets saw a sharp reversal, but recovered quickly enough. (Source - [INDIAN DEMONETIZATION AND THE LIQUIDITY CONUNDRUM](https://insight.factset.com/indian-demonetization-and-the-liquidity-conundrum))
* Economic growth slowed to 6.1 percent, a loss of 2-3 percent. Please note we were already on the cusp of an economic slowdown and the subsequent measures such as DeMo and GST further aggravated the issue. (Source - [Demonetisation hit growth by 2 percentage points: US Study](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/demonetisation-hit-growth-by-2-percentage-points-us-study/articleshow/67154320.cms))

**The Ugly:**

* The excercise led to the death of several people, and caused immeasurable distress to a significant percentage of the population. I don't feel the need to go into detail as this is not the point of this post.

A couple more points I'd like to add:

* Just because **99.3%** of the cash in circulation prior to DeMo has returned to the system doesn't mean that the excercise was a complete failure. The issue of black money was tackled on several fronts. I believe the main point of DeMo was never to take out a significant chunk of currency out of rotation (despite what the government says). I believe the government got everyone on the black-money bandwagon as a way to make people feel that they personally were helping in the fight against black money. Again, just my theory.
* I believe the true purpose of DeMo was to bring **more transparency and accountability** to the economic system, in addition to making more and more of India **tax compliant and a part of the formal economy.** I do believe that the informal sector plays a very important role, particularly in the times of economic crisis, but that's a story for another day.

Summing up, I'd like to point out that DeMo can neither be categorized as a success or a failure. It has its place, in the grey, neither black nor white as some people believe. That's the point of my post. Thanks for reading.Please let me know if I missed anything and I'd be happy to update my post."," I do not agree with your summation. As a small business owner myself, my overall takeaway is that it was pretty detrimental for the growth for many of us. 

Earlier I was supportive of a move to eliminate black money but I saw my own income drop by 70% as well as many of my friend's startups failing or forcing enterpreneurs to get jobs instead of trying to pursue their ideas. Instead of getting tax rebates and incentives, if small business provide jobs, we were burdened with thr complicated process of gst and huge fall of demand from the medium-paying client. > I believe the true purpose of DeMo was to bring more transparency and accountability to the economic system

Can we please have this transparency and accountability in all aspects of governance? Or is that too much to ask.

Anyway its enlightening to look at this discussion, please carry on the financial perspectives, sorry about the digression.

EDIT: This thread was submitted 12 hours ago? Come on fellas, this thread needs several upvotes. After long last we are seeing a topic with SUBSTANTIAL data points, we really need to debate this topic to death and there should be more inputs such as the one from /u/ravivazirani TLDR.....Life is so cheap in India and OP has no issues with that. Not to nitpick but analysis need to go further into the ugly part also. The dear leader and the government is for the whole nation and her people, not just the ones that have as much money as they have and not just the ones that speak their language and not just the ones that follow their religion."

It seems the govt is clueless about even providing testing kits clearances. How can you expect such a clueless government to provide the best response for a fast spreading pandemic? 

When people keep drinking gaumutr and voting for ram mandir and statues, a clueless government is what you will get. 

Almost every major country has announced billions $ of rescue packages. Trump has even publicly identified industries like aviation tourism etc which have been hit hard, and the US govt will publicly aid the companies in these sectors.

Indian businesses ranging from airlines to travel, tourism, malls, daily groceries have all been affected  yet not a word has been said about helping the affected industries. 

Chaddies do not have intelligence and thus cannot be expected to vote wisely. That is why chaddies were ruled with an iron hand by kings throughout history, even chaddis wet dream kingdom of ram rajya was autocratic dictatorship and not a democracy. Now chaddi clad sanghie bhaktas are exhibiting their clueless in exercising their franchise, resulting in great damage to India as a whole."," Slow claps from the balcony..

Keep cases low,and prevent mass panic among the public to avoid burdening our health services- this is the govt's strategy. A shitty one, albeit. Ab hum kahe to kahe kya? Bole toh bole kya?

662,Policy/Economy,ITS LOCK ON for Indian Real Estate,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fxmvof/its_lock_on_for_indian_real_estate/,"  

***LOCK – ON means 'Disambiguation' which refers to the removal of ambiguity by making something clear.***

We never would’ve imagined a day when 1/3rd of world’s population would be in a lockdown. While the wrath of the lockdown has totally changed our lives, putting our work and finances in a jeopardy, our future will depend largely on how we utilize the time available today. The lockdown gives us ample of time to ponder upon key decisions taken and to be taken, explore avenues for reviving the finances, make mindful investments and rectify the unpreparedness with which we are facing today’s situation. Make a choice now, whether you want to repent over what went wrong or make lemonade out of the lemons life (or the virus) has thrown upon us. If you choose the latter, then this article is for you to read ahead. 

This pandemic has rightly taught us that **uncertainties come unexpectedly.** How prepared are we to face an adverse situation again?

Businesses are adversely hit and job security has gone for a toss, leaving us in a catch 20 situation. Talking about investments, the FDs, Stocks, shares that we invested in are witnessing negative returns. Our priced possessions like jewelry and gold are locked up in banks and not helping us get through the situation. Fancy cars are stationed in parking lots, unused. The alternate investment options like SIPs, Mutual Funds too aren’t performing. 

Remarkably, **one thing that has stood between us and the disaster is HOME**. A sense of safety and security that a home brings for a family is irreplaceable. It is a physical as well as an emotional comfort zone where one heals and recuperates through tough times. Man, right from the stone age has been wandering in search of a home (caves), to protect himself, establish a family, dwell in and flourish. 

A critical question arising out of the Covid19 scenario is **what will be the fate of home buying and Real Estate post the lockdown?**

Studies and reports suggest that the real estate sector will decline; witnessing the worst hit till date and survival will be a challenge. However, as said by Benjamin Franklin, “Out of Adversity comes Opportunity”. The sector also flashes rays of positivity and you would be intrigued to know about the potential to INVEST in Real Estate, against all the current odds. 

Real Estate will be the most reliable investment option, considering the conditions of banks, share market crash and capital depreciation or any other option that may appear to be safe initially.

**Why will the Indian Real Estate sector grow faster than that of the world?**

1. The world economy will go into recession this year with a predicted loss of trillions of dollars of global income due to the coronavirus pandemic, spelling serious trouble for developing countries, with the likely exception of India and China, according to a latest UN trade report.

2. The virus pushes U.S.-Chinese relationship towards fracture; the fallout from the global pandemic threatens the recent U.S.-Chinese trade deal and could undermine future global stability. This rift will lead India to gain interests of global investors and companies. These investments open doors for better infrastructure, leading to the opening of multiple employment opportunities. These factors directly balm the upward movement of real estate in India.

3. China lost its goodwill and trust from investors and the corporate world, owing to the   
 (rumored) conspiracies in the way the country handled the spread of COVID 19 to the world. After China, India is the only country with the capacity to handle the magnitude of the Global scale, in terms of manpower, resources, transport systems, etc.

4. India so far, has augmented trust in handling corona and has bravely fought pandemics in the past too. Indian Real Estate gains appreciation form world economists for its perception as a Nation full of values and ethics, leading India with great avenues to become a Global Superpower.

5. NRI investment in real estate is bound to improve amidst Rupee fall.

While the above conditions make India a lucrative hotspot of real estate investments, below are few points to consider towards real estate buying: 

 **Emotional Investment**: In India, owning a home is a matter of pride and esteem. The sentiment runs around passing the home possession as a heritage from parents to the future generations. Interestingly, after our first name, ‘Home’ is second most used Word in the world every day. Ultimately, whatever be the circumstances people across the World will not stop investing in a home or buying real estate. 

**Statistics:** The Indian Real estate growth trajectory, since the past few years was likely to emerge stronger and is projected to be USD 650 Bn by 2025 and USD 1,000 Bn by 2030. Residential, commercial and Retail are the three key asset classes, which have primarily been contributing to the sector’s growth. Real estate contributed nearly 6% to India’s GDP in 2017. As per the projected growth trends, the sector’s contribution is likely to rise to 13% of India’s GDP by 2025.

· **Real Estate – Largest Employment Generator:** After agriculture, Real estate is the largest employment generator in the country, creating tremendous opportunities for the skilled and unskilled workforce. **India’s Real Estate employee base is estimated to be 67 Mn by 2022.**

· **High Tangible Asset Value:** Real estate is not paper money, this is the asset you can hold tangibly which again increases its reliability and return on investment.

· **Competitive Risk- Adjustment Returns :** Based on July 2018 data from National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries **(NCREIF),** private market **Commercial Real Estate returned** an **average of 9.85% over the past five years.** This credible performance was achieved, together with low volatility relative to equities and bonds, for highly competitive risk-adjustment returns. 

· **Attractive and Stable Income Return (Specially in Commercial space):** The **rental yield from real estate is much higher than returns on any traditional sources of investment**. Commercial investment can yield upto 12% ROI and lowest to 5% ROI (with capital appreciation) depending upon the construction stage and lease terms of the property.

· **Inflation Hedging:** The inflation hedging capability of real estate stems from the positive relationship between GDP growth and demand for real estate. As economies expand, the demand for real estate derives rents higher and this, in turn, translates into higher capital values.

· **Long Term “Assured” Wealth Building Asset with “Predictable “ Returns and least Risk** :- Real Estate helps you build wealth in long term due to dual advantage of Regular **“Predictable” Returns (yield is higher than Dividend Returns) and an “Assured” Capital Appreciation in long term**, don’t be scared of Corporate Scams, while they can affect the company’s stock price or your bank’s health, but it cannot junk out the value of real estate you own 

· **“Helps you Raise Money Quickly”** \- **Hard Asset is the most preferred collateral for a Bank**, to raise capital through a loan (LAP/LRD) your property is the best asset you could own!

· **The Ever Rising FSI Benefit** \- **“Wine and Real Estate improve with Age”** \- While as per accounting standards real estate is not a depreciating asset, in practical life too an older development can reap benefits of redevelopment wherein due to ever increasing FSI norms of MMR the incoming developer would not only offer rent for transit accommodation and corpus as hardship allowance, but also offer at least 25% to 30% enhanced Area (which is of great value as remember, 1 sq.ft of Real Estate in Central Mumbai is valued more than 10 gram of gold) !!

· **Work from Home Culture:** We are in the middle of the largest test of home-working in history and corporates are adopting, refining and testing policies, processes and infrastructure to make it work. We expect quarantine protocols to encourage work-from-home initiatives and for these practices to be adopted in new geographies as the contagion spreads. Large multinationals who recently, and publicly, announced the scaling back of home-working practices now indicate a desire to embrace widespread use of this practice until the outbreak passes. So commercial demands and co-working space or bigger house may increase.

· **Student Housing:** An unusual market development that is gradually emerging is student housing in India. Real estate consultancy firm, Anarock Property Consultants says that of the 37 million students pursuing higher education in India, more than 75% live away from home. Existing hostel facilities can accommodate only 18%-20% of this migrant student population. Developers in Mumbai & Pune have already ventured into this space that offers 7% returns.

· **Co-living market** size across India’s top 30 cities is expected to grow more than double by 2025 to $13.92 billion from current $ 6.67 billion. The demand for co-living in terms of beds is slated to grow to 5.7 million from 4.19 million, while the share of private beds is likely to rise from 15% to 30% of total demand in the co-living segment, showed a Cushman & Wakefield India report.

· **REITs are a great investment avenue** not only for institutional investors but also for retail investors, who find it difficult to invest in the commercial real estate, which has a better rent yielding than residential properties. Unlike other equity investments, REITs provide assured returns to the investors through a compulsory dividend distribution policy. REITs are mandated to distribute 90% of their net distributable income as dividend. There is also a further upside potential for the investors from periodic property valuations. India's first listed REIT, has gained 50% since listing in March 2019 as against a 10% gain in the Nifty Realty Index and 5% return of the benchmark Nifty 50.

· India’s improved rank on **Ease of Doing Business** and the courage to implement reforms such as DeMo, RERA, and IBC are indeed creditworthy. These are expected to yield fruitful results in the future and help establish Indian real estate as a preferred destination for global investors, occupiers, and homebuyers.

**WHY REAL ESTATE DURING LOCKDOWN?**

Probably most of the people interested in buying real estate would be holding their decision till the lock down opens due to speculations in the market or risk pertaining to economic conditions. Yet for any **clever investor who is observing the current market will testify buying of real estate during lock down to be the smartest move. Here is why –**

1. **Reduction in Home loan rates:** On 27 March 2020, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reduced the repo rate by 75 basis points (bps). The reduction saw the repo rate reduce from 5.15% to 4.40%. New home loan rates start at 8% from 1 March 2020. So indeed this is good time to buy your home if the decision was just hiding behind the corner for some better rates or good units.

2. **Low Demand – Value for Money:** Real estate is facing deficit demand in the market which leads to generation of various attractive offers by Developers. To maintain the good books, builders are currently offering very low rates, lucrative payment plans and additional offers resulting in lowering the cost of property. End-user can expect to buy a property as low as the launch price during this lock down.

3. **Reduction in Stamp Duty:** The Maharashtra government on March 6 announced that it is reducing stamp duty on properties by 1% for Mumbai, MMRDA Region and Pune for a period of two years.

4. **Passive Income:** Various small investment options are being introduced in the market starting as low as 5 lacs in real estate that too with a rental income. This is again an opportunity to create a separate asset class in your portfolio and start a source of passive income.

5. **Demand- Supply breakthrough:** Due to low demand, discounted rates on good inventories are available. But once the economic condition will start settling, the bargain will reduce and demand will also start floating upwards. The rates will not be as low as they are now during lock down.

6. **Segment Shift** : Earlier Lower middle class people used to buy 10 to 12 Lakh property. Now middle class will buy those as an investor and rent it out to lower middle income group. Similarly shift will take place on affordable segment likewise. Middle income group will emerge as new investor community.

7. **Strike the Iron when it is Hot:** We all must have heard this at least once. But it’s time to implement the strategy to gain extensive returns on the investment. Not only the rates are strikingly low, the return on investment that are being offered by some Developers is as high as 15-18%.

**Final Thoughts:** 

**Your Money is SAFE IN Indian Real Estate**

\- Regulator like MahaRERA leading the cause of timely justice, 

\- High Court Judiciary being extremely proactive and pro-consumer / investor, 

\- NCLT giving prompt hearings and orders favoring customer and financial institution and lastly 

\- The Supreme Court judgment re-affirms the rights of the homebuyers as financial creditors under the bankruptcy code.... 

Simply put, it means that homebuyers share equal rights of recovery in the developer's assets which are liquidated as part of the bankruptcy process

**The Bottom Line**

**Real Estate cannot be lost or stolen, nor can it be carried away, purchased with common sense, paid in full, and managed with reasonable care , IT IS ABOUT THE SAFEST INVESTMENT IN THE WORLD.**

Real estate is a distinct asset class that is simple to understand and can enhance the risk and return profile of an investor’s portfolio. On its own, real estate offers competitive risk-adjusted returns, with less principal-agent conflict and attractive income streams. Though ill-liquidity can be a concern for some investors, there are ways to gain exposure to real estate yet reduce ill-liquidity and even bring it on-par with that of traditional asset classes. Real Estate investing even on a small scale, remains a tried and true means of building an individual’s cash flow and wealth.

**“BUY Real Estate in areas where the Path EXISTS , AND Buy MORE Real Estate where there is no PATH, but YOU can Create Your OWN. Don’t WAIT to BUY Real Estate , BUY Real Estate and WAIT.**

Can't afford groceries if the lockdown goes on for another month. Sure, suggest us to buy cheap properties. Fucking real estate assholes. To a hammer,every problem looks like it can be fixed by a nail. Fact of the matter is real estate is a bad investment in India. You may buy a house if you wish to live in it. However as an investment vehicle with pitiful rental yields of 2-3% due to over supply in most cities, it is a renter's market.

Buying land on the outskirts where the city will grow into is a much better investment compared to buying built real estate. REAL ESTATE SHOULE BE THE LAST THING one should be investing in , in the next 12-15 months.

1. Rental yields from a rented home would barely be enough to cover the EMI of a housing loan ( let alone act as a secondary source of income ) 
I'm




2. Houses are highly illiquid investments. With the kind of job losses predicted over the next 12-15 months , one needs or have a solid savings pool to be easily accessible. If there are no takers for your house , you will have virtually no  liquidity on hand to provide for emergency expenditures ( mom and dad falling ill, deferred jobs for your sons and daughters , layoffs for you etc ) 



3. Post corona,  the reverse migration that has happened will not see most migrants returning any time soon. Most villages are self sufficient and labor migrates for better opportunities to cities. There will be  scant opportunities  post corona recovery and labour shortages will not be accompanied by commensurate wage increase as real estate firms will not be able to afford higher project outflows for labour. 

So expect massive delays on projects that are under construction . 


A large number of real estate firms will wind up. Quite a few will be stuck in litigation . You money may be stuck and you may never even see an asset. 


We are going through a highly irregular time. This is not a good time for such stupid investment decisions 

PSA : Stay away from this wall of text put up by OP !!!!! 

Real estate is the last thing a smart man should be looking at for the next 15-24 months. 

Park your savings in easily liquifiable and safe investments for the time being. ( FDs and savings accounts and maybe a few blue chip stocks )

663,Policy/Economy,Oil slump? India will rather play dumb by raising prices,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fiolca/oil_slump_india_will_rather_play_dumb_by_raising/,"https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/government-raises-excise-duty-on-petrol-diesel-by-rs-3-per-litre-2194742?pfrom=home-topstories

The taxes on Petrol and Diesel have grown by over 100% in the tenure of Modi government. While the other big economies are trying to ensure that they do not go in economic slump by easing their monetary policy, India is busy dampening consumer confidence.

This news closely follows another one where the Modi government fired Urjit PATEL for not financing 1.56L crores worth of government expenditure.

The markets are reeling heavily downwards under pressure due to C scare, and it is very likely that the investors will pull out their investments from higher risk based emerging economies. In a looming recession, the growth can flee and the institutional investors may pull out in hoards.

The Indian banks are failing and the modi government is further dampening the consumer confidence by raising taxes on staple like Petrol. The recent drop in oil prices was perfect opportunity for the government to announce a reduction. 

In the times needing economic rescue via freer monetary measures , the government has chosen to play out a decision lacking economic prudence."," They did the same thing in 2018, when crude oil prices fell, they increased taxes on petrol and diesel.

https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/policy/excise-duty-on-petrol-diesel-to-give-big-boost-to-centres-revenue-kitty/article22723716.ece

It worked out really well for them, centre got a big boost in revenue, and no one seemed to have noticed or cared (going by the resounding victory in the 2019 general election). Since the strategy worked so well before, of course they will try it again. Chutiye hain, they are only trying to help out their financiers, corporate donors. The corporate tax cut was the worst decision in the last 6 months IMHO. 

Modi's legacy will be filled with pakoda logic when people study history. He has the same place in history as Tuglak. [deleted] Bhai aur to koi income hai nahi, petrol se hi kuch kama lene do central aur state govt ko yes but you are antinational and no one listens to people like you because hindu khatre main I always support higher taxes and prices on oil. we need to reduce our dependence on that shit. in addition, i want that extra money to be  put into alternative energy like solar and electric vehicles and in fighting the impact of climate change"

**India Can Become Powerhouse Economy If Policies Managed Well, Says IMF** 

 ______ 
If economic policies are managed well India will be a powerhouse economy, IMF
has said

**Washington: **

India can become a powerhouse economy if policies are managed well and reforms
are supportive of inclusive growth, a top IMF official has said.

David Lipton, the International Monetary Fund's First Deputy Managing
Director, also expressed hope that India's growth will be reflected in poverty
reduction statistics and eventually in a measurement of metrics of inclusion.

""If policies are managed well and reforms are supportive of inclusive growth,
India's economy could become a powerhouse economy. It is already, I think the
10th largest, but with the population and the growth rate there's more
potential,"" he told news agency PTI.

""I've said there's more to be done. There are further reforms both in terms of
consolidating the budget situation to ensure that there's never an incident of
doubt about fiscal finances in terms of making the banking system more
competitive and dealing with the legacy problems of NPAs (non- performing
assets),"" he said.

He said the important job was not just to recapitalise, but to change the
governance and change the competitiveness so that banks serve as a positive
force by allocating credit well and being a driving force in the economy .

__ Comments

Asked about IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde's remarks that she does
not expect any major economic reforms in an election year, Mr Lipton said:
""It's always a difficult to make policy during election years.

""We certainly hope that there can continue to be a progress, but it's really
the judgement of the politicians, the government about what can be done when"".

This mass exodus of migrant workers is what happens when a government is myopic to the point of blindness. A proper plan could and would have prevented this. A proper stimulus package planned in advance, and not one quickly put together in reaction to this, should have been there. This mass exodus has many, many, many problems surrounding it. For one, can you imagine people turning into nomads overnight when food and water that's usually available everywhere is missing thanks to a lockdown? Can you imagine, how these men, women, and children are supposed to *walk* hundreds of kilometers in absence of public transport? It's beyond cruel what the Centre has compelled these already oppressed groups of people to do right now. These migrant workers will also (many already are) face the brutality of lathi-happy cops. With state borders locked, they will essentially remain nomads, unless proper arrangements are made for them.  And, worst of all, these migrant workers, who don't have the luxury to wash hands for twenty seconds with soaps (can't afford soaps, can't afford to waste what little water they have), how are they supposed to remain safe from the pandemic? It's also equally likely that they make take the coronavirus along with them to their villages. And let's not forget that rural public healthcare is already in shambles. Those rushing to fellate the prime minister for his ""brave"" and ""strong"" step do not fucking understand how this lockdown has already disrupted the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.

This thread is to document this tragedy. Please post any more videos, images or news articles in the comments. I will update the thread."," Requesting all to keep this thread updated. We need to keep alive this sincere and serious attempt. Lockdown should have been done giving enough timeframe and means to people to reach their home. Instead it was done almost over night and hence these problems. Chances of homeless migrant workers spreading disease are higher also they have to survive in difficult conditions as mentioned in the post. Modi's incompetence knows no bounds. 

These fucking grand, over the top, bombastic decisions will be our ruin. I'm 100% in favor of a lockdown, but the way this was announced just goes to show how out of touch modi is. For someone who claims to be a ""fakeer"" he doesn't know anything about India's poverty levels it is the govt of the pandit, thanedar, sahukar, zemindar... remember how they hated NREGA"
666,Policy/Economy,Opinion: BJPs policies have alienated a large section of Middle Class Hindus,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f15kgm/opinion_bjps_policies_have_alienated_a_large/,"One of India's Election Commissioners, Ashok Lavasa, in a brilliant [recent ](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/the-difficulty-of-being-honest-prevention-of-corruption-act-ashok-lavasa-election-commission-of-india-6188078/)article  wrote,""People are generally good; they are also generally timid"". And I think it defines our middle classes perfectly.

India has always had an aspirational middle class. This middle class is largely moderate, driven by ambitions of economic prosperity and social stability (just like the middle classes of any other country). They want to be socially and economically upwardly mobile, resent overtly divisive policies with uncertain ends and are busy in their lives (thus the timidity).

Now, the point of a democratic society is democratic changes (a.k.a gradual changes). There's a reason we're regarded as elephants and China's as a dragon. We praise China for what they've done with their economy but hold dear what we have i.e our voice.

Modi Govt seems to be constantly stirring the pot with radical policies. This has started affecting the lives of a common Indian more than ever, and negatively too. Modi supporter or not, demonetisation, for example, in hindsight, is uniformly chided for being wasteful and avoidable.

Middle and lower middle classes will now increasingly start disassociating with what this govt stands for. The CAA crackdown, kashmir situation but most importantly the incompetent handling of the economy will soon have them looking for viable alternatives. A BJP, which for the longest time stood for economic liberalisation, corruption-free politics, efficient governance - atleast in the minds of the educated - now stands exposed with its vitriolic campaigns and its ineptitude to handle nuanced issues like the Kashmir problem. 

I see a political vacuum forming soon, and a desperate search for alternatives by the upwardly mobile middle and lower middle classes and an opportunity for something new."," > A BJP, which for the longest time stood for economic liberalisation, corruption-free politics, efficient governance - atleast in the minds of the educated - now stands exposed with its vitriolic campaigns and its ineptitude to handle nuanced issues like the Kashmir problem. 

Anybody who's followed the history of the BJP has always been aware that the BJP stands for none of what you've mentioned. 

Hate and vitriol have always been their identity, backed by protectionism, corruption, and incompetence. They were pretty smart in messaging during 2013 and 2014 with promises for jobs and economic growth. Now their ineptitude has been exposed and they veil has come off. No wonder this isn’t what people voted for. progressive & liberal in the office/onsite jobs/internet/school/college , archaic and conservative at home.  This is the average middle class household, being ""educated"" doesn't help. India's middle class is very conservative and believes in bigotry. I don't think think they are even close to being moderates. Perhaps not. Take a look at this comment on another thread.

> I talked to a friend who had worked for a BJP think tank, he told me BJP people aren't stupid, they polarize because his think tank and other companies have literally done data analytics stuff to show it works. They submit reports subtly suggesting keeping these policies running in nice white binders professionally typed out in English and with impeccable grammar to Amit Shah, Fadnavis, Modi, everyone. It's literally cause and effect. These guys are calculative thinkers, they don't care about religion and cow either, whatever makes them rich and keeps their friends happy. If the majority somehow starts becoming atheist overnight, BJP will literally start singing about eliminating religion tomorrow. I honestly want to blame the people for being so fucking dumb in the first place.

There are several votebanks in operation for BJP. There is the core RSS votebank, the Modi votebank, the development votebank, a newly minted SC/ST/OBC votebank and so on. The development votebank is fast disappearing, true. And probably turning into an anti Modi votebank. But the rest are new, believers in **what Modi has been doing since 2014** and they remain steadfast.

End of the day, the total anti BJP voter share in India is higher than BJP's vote share, all put together. But there is no one to bring those votes all across India against BJP. There is no leadership, no unity, no clear strategy. I like your optimism The fundamental truth that I have learned about Indian politics is that it is dependent not on ideology, policy or party allegiance but largely on cult of personality. We have had people like Bal Thackeray who was never elected to any position but controlled the politics of one of the largest states and one of the most important cities of the country for decades. Gandhi's,  Jaya Lalitha, MSG, Mamta Banerjee the list goes on and on. 

Modi has created a cult of personality for himself that even opposition candidates are fearful of attacking him directly (rather than trading barbs with Amit Shah or BJP MLA's). Until an opposition party with cross national muscle has a leadership figure who can cultivate a cult of personality around himself to oppose Modi, there will be no real power vacuum at the national level.

Congress is dead behind Rahul Gandhi, no other opposition party has a nationally relevant figure. Future I could see is with AAP/Kejriwal who has moulded himself into the archetype of middle-class Indian man, but AAP have years if not decades of work ahead of them to build a national party rather than a regional one. Lauda kuch nahi hone wala. This country is full of chutiyas. BJP will win again at the national level because Congress has shat the bed. I so hope somehow Kejriwal sir does well in Delhi again in the next 4 years and he can form a good opposition to the Nazi Sanghi squad. Middle class in India is tiny percentage of population. BJP knows they can take them for granted They had this great opportunity after revoking 370, win the confidence of people there, bring stability. Instead they installed a dick of a governer who is bullshitting and their ministers from other states giving statements that they will go and buy lands there.

In no time, local news channels flashed celebratory headlines and even recalled that the same credit ratings agency had downgraded India’s outlook to negative only last month.
Far from trumping our eastern neighbour, we are not even close to them when it comes to international credit ratings. On a scale of 1-21, we rank 16th, while arch-rival India ranks 9th.

>In the latest review, Moody’s upgraded Pakistan’s outlook to positive, which simply means that the country’s economy is moving in a positive direction. But it didn’t increase Pakistan’s credit rating, which remains at B3 –  the level it has been maintaining since June, 2015.
>India, on the other hand, stands at Baa2 or seven notches better than Pakistan on Moody’s scale.

https://www.samaa.tv/money/2019/12/no-pakistans-credit-rating-is-not-better-than-indias/amp/ Actually I read an article where it was mentioned that places where some kind of political turmoil subsides and things begin to calm down, there is a sudden increase in foreign investment opportunities. The example of Egypt was given in the article, that right after Arab Spring or Hossini Mubarak was voted out and the coupe and after all that, Egypt became very lucrative for foreign investment. Pakistani here, been following our economy closely so may be able to shed more light on this.

Moody is not saying that Pakistan is a better place to invest than India or that Pakistan's economy is better than India's right now. 

What it is saying is that its outlook for Pakistan is positive while its outlook for India is negative. This means that, according to their assessment, India's economy will be worse than it is right now in the future while Pakistan's will be better than it is right now

How is Pakistan doing this? Pakistan has had some strict policies, which the general population is hating because all imported goods are now much more expensive, life is harder for us right now. However, through this policy Pakistan has drastically lowered exports, which has 'improved' our trade deficit. 

Pakistan's current government has many similar policies which are targeting macroeconomic indicators to strengthen the economy. Our previous government was artificially inflating the rupee (the rate was around 100pkr per USD) by selling its dollar reserves and buying rupees. The current government stopped doing this and let the rupee reach its actual value. The rupee went from 100 to 150 per USD in the matter of a few months, but it is now stable and slowly starting to improve

On the other hand, Indian government is doing stuff like demonetization and fudging economic numbers to make itself look good. Moody basically looked at the way both countries are being run and assessed that Pakistan is improving because they are willing to take hard decisions to improve the economy, while India is, uh, doing other things Investors in Pakistan having a blast Kashmir masterstroke coming home to roost. 

Most Indians don’t realize what a Pandora’s box that has opened up. 

When the MEA says that the greatest defense obstacle for India’s progress is its unresolved borders that bloat the armed forces, and then the same government unilaterally decides to massively change the status quo without taking into account external threats, and ends up making it so that now China claims all of Ladakh(South-Tibet) and is constantly upping the ante on neighboring countries like Nepal to take up border issues with India, not to mention the uptick in incursions in the North East.

So now India is bleeding resources on self inflicted wounds while the adversary gets to sit back, focus on building internal strength, and cry foul about the human rights violations that tarnish India’s image and economic desirability. 

Indians can act like the repeated bashing’s in premier western publications are worthless but all these add up to form public and investor perception, this will have long term consequences and they are already coming to fruition. You keep saying Go To Pakistan. Everyone is going there... Is this the same Moody's that gave CDOs with subprime mortgages a AAA rating? Ofcourse, who doesn't like to be shot in their head once in a while."
670,Policy/Economy,"Delhi Government today raised the minimum wage to highest for any state in the country, after SC ruled in their favour. Almost 3 times as much as UP. Will immediately benefit 55 lakh workers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dooafc/delhi_government_today_raised_the_minimum_wage_to/,"Delhi government had tried to raise the minimum wage in 2017 but this had been taken to court by a number of associations of employers. High Court ordered against the hike in 2018, which was then appealed to Supreme Court. 

Delhi government then constituted a Minimum Wage Advisory Committee in November 2018 that finalised the wages. This amounts to Rs14,842/month for unskilled workers, which was submitted before the Supreme Court. The SC has now accepted Delhi Government's proposal. 

Comparison with some other states:

> Delhi ₹14842

> Haryana ₹8827

> UP ₹5750

> Gujarat ₹8190

> Maharashtra ₹10411

> [National Minimum Wage](https://thewire.in/labour/delhi-minimum-wake-hike) ₹ 4,576 (recommended, but not implemented ₹9,750) 

Of course Delhi has a higher cost of living, but I can't imagine other cities like Lucknow being 3 times cheaper. Therefore other state governments also need to look at their wages and revise them. 


> A Bench of Justices U.U. Lalit and Aniruddha Bose, in an order passed on October 14, permitted the Delhi government to bring into effect its draft proposal to revise minimum wages of unskilled labourers to ₹14,842, ₹16,341 for semi-skilled, ₹17,991 for skilled workers, ₹16,341 for non-matriculates, ₹17,991 for matriculates who are not graduates and ₹19,572 for graduates and above.

> In an affidavit filed on August 26 this year, the Delhi government said it has proposed the revised minimum wages taking into consideration “the average prices of food items and clothing component and other prescribed percentage of other components i.e. housing, light & fuel and education/social obligation”.

> https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/sc-allows-aap-govt-to-revise-minimum-wages/article29817076.ece

Delhi had earlier removed more than 1300 contractors from working for the government because they were not paying the prescribed minimum wage."," Whoa! I just realized how much less I was paid for my job. Internship is still a loophole Question: Do the employers actually pay such minimum wages? Not just Delhi, in any place. India has minimum wage? It is a good step. Although many unskilled workers' work is not documented and is paid whatever the employer feels like one would agree to work on. 

Currently, in NCT Delhi daily wage worker/ contract based/ dihadi majdoor / construction labors are paid around 300 rs /day for 10 hrs of work. 

So not much is changed however what has been done is commendable. Curious - how much merit is there to concerns of labour intensive businesses migrating to other states? This sounds good on paper. But **it is a good step if and only if the government has factored in whether the business industry can afford the additional cost.** This is why it is important to talk to the industry too. Otherwise, the industries will just move their factories to other states causing a huge job loss in Delhi. And the businesses who remain will be forced to increase their price to be in business making everything for the consumers in Delhi costlier. 

This will probably end up as a costly learning experience to the inexperienced AAP government - **if you side only with the workers it's communism, and if you only support the corporates it's capitalism**. And both these models won't work in India. That is why it is important to talk to both parties to understand each others problem, and then create policies that address them.

-------------

**Edit**: As an example of considering a lot of things when making a policy - free education for all sounds like a great idea. Until you factor in the reality that you then have to create jobs for all these educated people. And you would also drive down the cost of labour with so many educated people seeking jobs. This is why education in India (and other countries) is deliberately affordable to only a certain section of society or to the exceptional (scholarships). That is why education is only free up to the level our economy can accommodate (currently at school levels, as offered in government schools). This is why it is important to talk with every stakeholder when making a policy. Hopefully AAP has done this.

-------------------

For those interested, [Minimum Wages For States Across India](https://www.simpliance.in/minimum-wages). It's a good move. Depending on how strictly they are followed it can have direct and indirect effects on the wage curve. And I think the indirect effects is what the companies are scared of, because it cost them more. So they will try to find loopholes or have undocumented work done. Wow, I was paid 15,000 bucks for 6 days a week, 8 hours a day and I had an MA in psychology. Depressing as fuck. Also, we pay our maids way less than the minimum wage in Maharashtra, looks like. why won't they vote for them first free travel for women in DTC now this Highest in the country? I think Kerala has a minimum wage of 18000 , correct me if iam wrong I don't understand why this is such big news, the central minimum wage for unskilled labour in Cat A centres has been 15,184 per 26 calendar days of 8 hours each with 2x for overtime since April and it's expected to be revised again this month.

These rates are religiously followed by Central govt/PSUs for contract labour. The Delhi govt. is not even matching this figure.

Edit: the rates have been revised upwards since October 1, 2019. >	Comparison with some other states:

>Maharashtra ₹10411

I would literally have to fire half my staff if this was ever actually enforced. 

Regulations should be made based on what's plausible and enforceable. These 'best case' regulations are fucking stupid. It just encourages people to do underhanded shit. Now see industries shift from Delhi. 

Atleast this will reduce the pollution. [deleted] Kejriwal and Bernie Sanders are so damn similar.

673,Policy/Economy,"Economists of r/India , can you give your views or comments on inflation in India and it's relationship to unemployment . Read details below",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g141sz/economists_of_rindia_can_you_give_your_views_or/,"Recently , I was reading an article on inflation and unemployment

>A.W. Phillips was one of the first economists to present compelling evidence of the inverse relationship between unemployment and wage inflation. Phillips studied the relationship between unemployment and the rate of change of wages in the United Kingdom over a period of almost a full century (1861-1957), and he discovered that the latter could be explained by (a) the level of unemployment and (b) the rate of change of unemployment.

>Phillips hypothesized that when demand for labor is high and there are few unemployed workers, employers can be expected to bid wages up quite rapidly. However, when demand for labor is low, and unemployment is high, workers are reluctant to accept lower wages than the prevailing rate, and as a result, wage rates fall very slowly.

>A second factor that affects wage rate changes is the rate of change in unemployment. If business is booming, employers will bid more vigorously for workers, which means that demand for labor is increasing at a fast pace (i.e., percentage unemployment is decreasing rapidly), than they would if the demand for labor were either not increasing (e.g., percentage unemployment is unchanging) or only increasing at a slow pace.

Does this mean the current government's quest for low inflation is indirectly leading to unemployment going up .

Low inflation means companies and investors have no initiative to invest . However during times of inflation , investors look for places to invest their money in since it will keep on losing its  value if it kept ideal .

During Congress years of 2004-2014 , high inflation also most probably lead to increased consumer spending and expenditure. Since a large sector of Indian economy is dependent on internal consumption , it experienced significant growth due to it 


The reserve bank of India has been also extremely focused on fighting inflation . Many people are saying that this obsession with inflation is causing them to keep interest rates too high , as a result of which private companies have no initiative to borrow loans for new ventures


>As these examples of hyperinflation show, states have a powerful incentive to keep price rises in check. For the past century in the U.S., the approach has been to manage inflation using monetary policy. To do so, the Federal Reserve (the U.S. central bank) relies on the relationship between inflation and interest rates. If interest rates are low, companies and individuals can borrow cheaply to start a business, earn a degree, hire new workers, or buy a shiny new boat. In other words, low rates encourage spending and investing, which generally stoke inflation in turn.By raising interest rates, central banks can put a damper on these rampaging animal spirits





https://m.economictimes.com/news/economy/policy/is-low-inflation-the-culprit-for-indias-economic-woes/articleshow/71190710.cms"," The relation between unemployment and inflation is not as simple in practice as modelled in Phillips Curve as it reduces human to a rational economic entity and will be willing to do the job at wages less than he/she deserves just because the inflation is high. 

&#x200B;

> “Do Phillips curves conditionally help to forecast inflation?”, a 2017 paper by Michael Dotsey, Shigeru Fujita and Tom Stark published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, however, argues that central bankers may be using the wrong economic model to frame policy. **The authors argue that there is no real trade-off between inflation and unemployment, as assumed by generations of economists, as models based on the Phillips curve have a poor forecasting record. This should not be surprising.**   
>  
>The stagflation of the 1970s proved quite convincingly tha**t high unemployment and high inflation can very well co-exist**. Also, wages may not be as rigid as many economists assume, which means that they could adjust downward quite comfortably in many cases. Lastly, loose monetary policy, apart from ramping up inflation, often also causes structural distortions in the economy which lead to higher unemployment. Given such complexity in an economy, any effort to micromanage it may well be a fool’s errand.

Also, the issue of unemployment in India is a structural one and can not be dealt with making small changes via Quarterly Monetary Policy Committee meetings. 

The issue lies with the fact that large amount of labour force depends on the Primary Sector which is worrisome as Primary sector does not contribute to GDP commensurately."

 February projected a 5.4 per cent real GDP growth for India in 2020. This too was a downgrade from 6.6 per cent earlier forecast. 

 “A number of governments and central banks have announced countervailing measures, including fiscal stimulus packages, policy rate cuts and regulatory forbearance; however, the effectiveness of policy easing will be blunted by measures to contain the outbreak, and policy space is constrained for some sovereigns,”

675,Policy/Economy,Why Russia in the Revolution of 1905 is analogous to India today,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fjkxnm/why_russia_in_the_revolution_of_1905_is_analogous/,"Russia in 1905 was controlled by a very hated Tsar. He was in control only because he controlled the police and media. The courts were also controlled by him and thus no real justice was possible. 

Ring a bell? Read on. 

He ruled only for the vested big industry and land owners. They made policies and he simply was their puppet. Farmers were in distress and yes you also had farmer suicide but the Tsar didn't care because his sycophants told him he was the best Tsar ever and that the Economy and people were in great shape?

 Ding ding ding. 

Now in 1904 and 1905 began a series of mass democratic protests, all inorganic and a will of the people. Did the Tsar listen to them? No, he ignored them at best and at worst unleashed his army and police on unarmed masses murdering them by the 1,000's. 

You have made the connection haven't you. 

As this was all making the Tsar look bad, a group of fascists called the Black Hundreds, supported by the police came up. Like the RSS today they were a fascist mob who used the support of the state to silence dissenting voices by violence. Now go read about them and you will see that they mirror the RSS exactly. A summary from Wikipedia. 

>The Black Hundreds were also noted for extremism and incitement to pogroms, nationalistic Russocentric doctrines, different xenophobic beliefs, including anti-Ukrainian sentiment[4] and anti-semitism.

Replace russocentric with Hindutva and anti Ukrainian with Bangladesh and semitism with Islam and you have the exact same Ideology. 

Whenever a peaceful protest came up, these thugs will show up, murder the peace loving protestors while the police turned a blind eye. 

This is exactly the same as India under the Fascist thug Modi.  

I do hope that the people rise up and eventually overthrow him, restoring the rule of democracy we had before him."," Ding ding

We are living in a democracy 



Ding ding 

Rules who pushed their luck too far , are defeated no matter how powerful they are 

Ding ding

Opposition is run by a joker 

Ding ding 

We have elections on frequent basis

Ding ding 

Ruling party lost a bunch of states in free elections 

Ding ding 

All the country  need is an opposition leader who is not a joker. Azaadi What happened in the end? How Russia got freedom form him? How many years it took?"
676,Policy/Economy,Narendra Modi is damaging India’s economy as well as its democracy,https://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/10/24/narendra-modi-is-damaging-indias-economy-as-well-as-its-democracy,," But voters are voting for BJP. If they are happy to get shafted, what can we do? Bharat mata ki jay!!

                                 -- argument khatam Demand for a complete democracy and stable economy is anti-hindu and anti-india. Isn’t it’s too early to say this? /s I have seen more critical news from The Economist and New York Times in past 1-2 years than any other Indian news outlet. Economist especially is going bonkers in recent times. Someone legit told me ki ""gst ane se efficiency itna badh gaya that vehicles are making the trip faster. Hence less trucks needed. "" 

My husband asked him, ""toh fir personal vehicles main bhi demand kam kyu hua.""

Silence on the other side. Government bus increased in Maharashtra directly by 5rs up from 25 to 30 after the results. Not just narendar chodi, but also the majority of bigots in India who support him/vote for him and defend his actions with baseless logic. 
They are equally to blame. This guy is illiterate, probably hasn't seen the world from the perspective of us redditors, and is just like an outlet for their bigotry along with rss propaganda. He tells people what they want to hear. He sells people what they want. People buy what they want. 
I think it's time we face the fact that not just this one guy, but the majority of the Indian population is fucked up in the head and *THAT* is what we need to repair and change. https://outline.com/VpSRFs People who voted for Modi, don't expect him to fix economy !

They want him to trouble Pakistan, talk about Ayodhya temple & cows, do massive rallies abroad, but most importantly to generally piss off muslims/christians citizens.
 
He has been excelling in all of those. No no we are best economy^/s No matter who comes in power, as long as the IAS still make policies, we will have a shitty economy. * Bad exports policy. [Textile exports](https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/indian-textile-sector-losing-edge-in-international-market-citi/article29184896.ece), [software exports](https://tech.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/corporate/indias-software-exporters-may-lose-based-on-falling-incentives-and-rising-tax-rates/70743190). We are no longer able to compete with other nations in various sectors.
* High taxes on transactions. An example from the advertising industry is the [6% equalization levy](https://cleartax.in/s/equalisation-levy](https://cleartax.in/s/equalisation-levy) charged on online advertising expenditure (If you spend 100 rs. on ads on Google, Facebook, or any online advertising platform, you have to pay Rs. 6 on the ad spend, making it Rs. 106, an overhead of Rs. 6 on your business.). This has made Indian advertising businesses and businesses requiring online advertisement, incompetent in the international arena. If your expenditure is Rs. 100 on ads, you'll have to pay Rs. 6 as an overhead to the Indian govt as a levy, making the cost Rs. 106.
* Exorbitant GST rates on various services and goods.
* Ease of doing business has decreased due to increased filing requirements for corporations and small businesses.
* Quick to ban, but not quick enough to regulate. Example: Cryptocurrency ban by the RBI. 

There are many things this Govt. is doing right as well, such as increasing the minimum turnover required for a business to register on GST. However, a major policy overhaul is required to boost competitiveness against countries with relatively relaxed tax policies to bring foreign money into India. Oh thanks for giving us an existential crisis right there !! >	The country at last has a leader with the power and the incentives to push through big reforms. But he is not acting

Oh, but he is Narendra Modi is NOT damaging anything! WE, the people of India ARE. We are failing as a democracy if we continue to elect him and his party on the basis of pseudo nationalism and Hinduism. In the long run, the country will get what it deserves. Comment 'aye' if you love reading the Economist. I wait on Thursday nights for it to come out. But listen. Arent you glad you knew about the shitbags before you made something good here and then saw it torn down by assholes? 

Atleast now, you have better idea of where to invest personal effort. By exploiting our people, not adulating them. The basic premise is fear. Some random guy says that he can solve all the problems and the public laps it up. Even though the person has no proven record or worse is known to be incompetent, fear drives mob crazy and we end up with leaders like Trump and Modi who promise everything under the heavens to the masses. I am astounded by the hate most of r/Indian have against Modi.

And all these 20 year old believe they know how economic reforms work. But hay who am I to question. Damaging?  ... It's been done already. I am dull when it comes to economy , can someone elucidate what policies affected our economy negatively ? One thing I noticed is inflation increased by 2-3 times in last 10 years. on a serious note, do we have a better option? Every economy in the world is shrinking at the moment and facing global slowdown https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2019/07/18/WEOupdateJuly2019 I think op is right.

677,Policy/Economy,Lives & livelihoods in India,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fzfkko/lives_livelihoods_in_india/,"Lives and livelihoods

Context:

The Prime Minister, while announcing the lockdown had to decide between saving lives and ensuring livelihoods. He rightly privileged the former over the latter then. As India nears the end of the lockdown period, the serious damage to the economy and livelihoods is beginning to make itself apparent. The editorial talks about various measures to manage the unprecedented crisis on the economic front.  

Issues:

There is tremendous pressure from industry bodies to opt for a nuanced policy that will help economic activity to restart.
They fear a collapse if activity is stopped for another fortnight.
Lives could be lost to hunger and livelihoods sacrificed in the lockdown.
Way ahead:

One way to sidestep this existential dilemma is by bringing on a second round of an economic relief package that goes well beyond the first both in terms of the financial commitment and the spread. 
The ₹1.7-lakh crore package announced by Finance Minister was a good start but barely accounted for 1% of GDP. India should spend at least 5% of GDP for now — about ₹10-lakh crore. 
The cash transfers to the poor should be hiked to at least ₹3,000 a month for the next three months. This should be in addition to free rations and cooking gas, as was announced earlier.
Out-of-the-box ideas for delivering support and also for raising the required funds might be required. 
The government should let go off fiscal conservatism and go all out to spend and support the economy. Economists are unanimous that there is little option now but to print money and spend (what the developed countries are doing).
In the harvest season, farmers need logistical support for moving their produce to markets.
Lenders, including NBFCs, should be granted freedom to reschedule their loan accounts so that borrowers are not under pressure to repay for fear of turning delinquent. 
A credit guarantee fund that will support non-delinquent borrowers for the next six months will be a good option. 
Such a fund can be financed through a domestic bond offering. 
The bankruptcy code should be suspended for the next six months, at least for MSMEs. 
A GST holiday for the next three months would be a good option.
The loss of revenue will be ₹3-lakh crore at worst, but in reality will be much lower than that because economic activity is at a standstill now. 
Such a move will ease cash flows for business and also obviate the need for statutory compliances at a time when the focus will have to be on getting businesses back on track. 


Conclusion:

The crisis now is without precedent and the solutions must not be conservative. Generous support from the government, and quickly delivered, is the need of the hour.", The gov want to restart the economy. I have no issue with that. But to start this stage of the virus where cases have just started to come out that's risky. Instead of stopping it this measure may accelerate the spread. Imo wait a month. Start restarting d economy from next month.
678,Policy/Economy,‘India in the midst of growth recession': Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan,https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/india-midst-growth-recession-former-rbi-governor-raghuram-rajan-113681,," From what I gather there's a kind of lethargy in the economy, like despite having capital people don't want to invest it. Any potential solutions to this problem. there is fear among everyone.muslims fearing about religion based crimes, industrialists fearing govt policies, middle class fearing losing jobs. then there are idiot politicians who instead of caring about this are making absurd comments defying all logic all science. Unless fundamentals improve, there won’t be private investment . If the government cuts jobs, investment, the vicious circle is complete. A bit  related question : 

Since markets are down, will it be good to invest in some of the good company shares for long term ? The greatest trick thats been played on the common masses has been the trickle down effect. The government caters to the problems of big multinational companies, and big lenders and hoping that the effect trickles down the pyramid to the lower section of the society. Decrease tax rates for wealthy because it would somehow improve situation for the other 98%.


Fuck this shit. I want the government to fucking care about common people instead. Make policies that benefit the 99% instead of the fucking 1% that have been increasing their share of the pie for years now. Economy is better when there is better circulation of money. The fact is that once the rich sense a weakness in the economy, they pull out. They invest elsewhere or just keep it to themselves. It leaves less for the other 99% and that's what we are seeing now.

Companies don't want to hire people because there is a lack of consumers. People are unemployed or working on much lower incomes which means they can only spend on what's necessary. Youth are not going for higher education because there are no jobs to get with those higher qualifications. This is an irreversible event the effects of which will be seen for years to come. A section of a generation that is undereducated and has low job experience in their formative years, and it can't be reversed now. The colleges have closed down and that can't be reversed. Companies have closed down and that can't be reversed either.

The thing is that common man ki gaand me itna dum nahi hai ki wo bahar ke deshon me money spend/invest kare. Or in immovable assets. These actions are reserved for the 1%. If common man has some extra money, what is he gonna do with it? He's not gonna deposit it into swiss bank accounts. In the end, the guy is going to spend it here:

- Buy a car: automobile industry profits
- Buys a home/flat: Real estate and construction
- drugs/prostitutes: unorganised skilled labour(?)
- better food: Groceries, Resturants, Farmers
- Start a business: The whole fucking economy+ more jobs
- Gadgets: Electronic industry, shops + jobs
- Health: Healthcare, Better life for common man is also supposed to be a goal for a government
- Education: Better generation of workers. Greater skills. Education industry

We've seen the top down approach and it's fucked the economy and I for one am pretty sick of it. The rich have become richer and they don't give two shits about you and me. Humari gaand bachane koi bahar se nahi aega, this is real life not a fucking movie. We have to vote based on the policies of the politicians.

My father tells me that *Ese hi chalta aya hai, when Congress was in power they did the same and now BJP is doing the same. Same shit, different toilet. The government has to bow down to the demands of the elites*. Who says we are restricted by these two options. Vote based on policies not party lines. Unless we vote based on the demands of the common man, no one would give a fuck about the demands of the common man.

Jai Hind. Still Sensex is making new highs, makes zero sense to me. Is ""growth recession"" one of the most unnecessary oxymorons in the English language.

**Indian economy: From policy paralysis to investment paralysis** 

 ______

Last week Prime Minister Narendra Modi joined the ongoing rhetorical debate on the state of the Indian economy with a strong defence of his government’s actions over the last three years. Among other things, his intervention put the spotlight on the Indian economy—something long overdue, but not for the rhetorical charges that are being flung around on both sides.

If indeed there is a pithy way of summarizing the state of affairs suffice to say that the country’s economy has transitioned from a state of policy paralysis (which identified the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance or UPA) to one of investment paralysis.

Both are cause for worry but for entirely different reasons. One was the outcome of a government which, for whatever reasons, went into a policy funk with disastrous consequences.

The other is the result of structural disruptions—some of which, like spiralling bad loans with banks, are a legacy of the UPA regime and a few induced by policy changes, like the rollout of the goods and services tax (GST) and demonetization of high value currencies, undertaken over the last three years.

So while one arose from inaction, the other is largely a fallout of not anticipating or reacting in time to address the disruptions arising from hitting the reset button on the economy.

It is important to grasp this distinction. Alternatively, there is a risk of being overwhelmed by the rhetorical claims and counterclaims on the economy; and missing the woods for the trees as it were.

As such the economy is not doing as badly as the opposition is claiming—especially with almost every agency forecasting a rebound in economic growth, albeit marginal, in subsequent quarters. Most importantly, macroeconomic stability has been restored. On the other hand, it is certainly not performing to potential—which some argue is around 8-8.5%—as the government’s spin doctors are arguing.

This potential can be tapped only if the investment levels, which have dropped to worrisome lows, recover. But this is easier said than done. The legacy of bad debts or what Arvind Subramanian, chief economic adviser, describes as the twin balance sheet problem (because it affects the books of both companies and the banks who extended the loans) is not something that can be resolved overnight.

Alongside the disruptions caused by structural policy responses like GST are causing considerable pain. As the old business structures built over seven decades are replaced, rather abruptly in some cases, the new systems are not up and ready to take over—indeed, execution of ideas is where this government has erred. It is the fallout of this transition, which is lending hope to critics and a cause for worry to the government.

In a column published in Mint last week, Indira Rajaraman, alluded to this phenomenon very succinctly. According to her, GST has completely recast the existing risk-sharing mechanism, dealing a death blow to retail trade volumes. The solution, like Rajaraman argued, is not to backtrack on GST (as some political parties are suggesting), but instead to fix the anomaly through tweaks (one of which was accepted by the GST Council on Friday by putting in place quarterly filing of returns, instead of every month).

Similarly, the government’s anti-corruption initiatives are forcing a transition to a more transparent transactions framework—exactly why real estate, which thrived on unaccounted cash, is in such doldrums. Here too, the alternative framework has been slow to evolve and the government and other institutions like the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are guilty of not pushing hard on walking the country through the required behavioural change.

The Economist Intelligence Unit in a note issued last week said as much.

“The deceleration in bank credit growth to industry is partly attributable to the RBI’s initiatives and the Bharatiya Janata Party’s efforts to reduce corruption at higher levels of business and government. However, the difficult business environment and slow-moving judicial system will make the transition to a more market-driven financial system extremely difficult,” and then added, “We believe that a revival in private investment depends on the government injecting additional capital to banks’ balance sheets, but also on companies readjusting their business models to the new financial system.”

In the final analysis, it can safely be said that the attention to the economy is welcome, but reducing it to a political blame game is not. And looking at a new and rapidly transforming India through a conventional lens is a bad idea.

The Union government, which has visibly begun its countdown to the 2019 general election as well as elections to key state assemblies like Gujarat, may be tempted to hit the panic button.

Even though politically expedient, it would be very myopic in terms of the long-term health of the Indian economy.

### 1) SARS-­CoV-­2 

* A paper published in a recent issue of the peer­reviewed, open­access journal ‘Emerging Microbes and Infections’ has cautioned that SARS­-CoV-­2, the virus causing the COVID-­19 outbreak, is being shed through multiple routes, so testing through oral swabs alone might not be sufficient
* A paper by Wei Zhang, et al, all from the CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, says investigations on patients in a local hospital infected with the virus revealed the presence of SARS-CoV-­2 in anal swabs and blood as well. What’s more, more anal swabs than oral swabs tested positive at a later stage of infection. Since COVID­19 is believed to be a disease of the respiratory tract, usually only oral swabs are used for diagnosis, and discharge is based on the oral swabs testing negative. The anal positives suggested, they argued, shedding through the oral ­fecal route, and therefore transmission is possible as well. The researchers also showed that a serology test (testing blood for antibodies) can improve detection positive rate, and thus should be used in the future.
* As part of the research, samples ­ including oral swabs, anal swabs and blood were collected by Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital. Two investigations were performed the paper describes ­ In the first investigation, samples were taken from 39 patients, 7 of whom were in a ‘severe condition’. In the second investigation, samples were lifted from 139 patients, whose clinical records were not available.
* When counting all swab positives together, we found most of the positives came from oral swab (8/10, 80%) on day 0. However, this trend appears to change on day 5. We found more (6/8, 75%) anal swab positive than oral swab positive (4/8, 50%)
* The data suggested a shift from more oral positives during the early period to more anal positives during the later period
* The current strategy for the detection of viral RNA in oral swabs used for 2019­nCoV diagnosis is not perfect. The virus may be present in anal swabs or blood of patients when oral swabs detection negative
* This observation implies that a patient cannot be discharged purely based on oral swabs testing negative, and the researchers go on to make a recommendation to do serological tests to confirm the status

#### About Coronaviruses

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.

#### What is COVID-19?

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

#### About SARS

The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. SARS is more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003.

### 2) G20 Meeting in Saudi Arabia

* Recently, the ministers and central bankers from the world’s largest economies participated in the G20 meeting held in Riyadh (Saudi Arabia).
* It was presided by Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is the first Arab nation to hold the G20 presidency.
* The 2020 G20 Presidency will focus discussions, forums, working groups and Ministerial Meetings under the theme of “Realizing Opportunities of the 21st Century for All”.

#### Key Points

* Global Economy:
   * The global economic growth remains slow and downside risks due to the geopolitical and remaining trade tensions, and policy uncertainty.
   * Though the economic growth is expected to increase in 2020 and 2021 due to loose monetary policy and an easing of trade tensions.
* IMF’ Views at the Meeting:
   * It projects a “V-shaped, rapid recovery” for the global economy, but it warns about the uncertainty around the spread of the coronavirus (COVID 19).
   * The IMF also warned about other risks including rising debt levels in some countries as well as climate change.
* Demand for Global Taxation System:
   * It discussed ways to achieve consensus on a global taxation system for the digital era by the end of 2020.
   * It aims to allow governments to tax digital companies where they do business, rather than where they are registered for tax purposes.
   * India has also demanded closer collaboration between international revenue agencies to investigate the tax affairs of offenders who cross borders for escaping tax investigation.

#### G-20

* About
   * The G20 is an informal group of 19 countries and the European Union, with representatives of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
   * The G20 membership comprises a mix of the world’s largest advanced and emerging economies, representing about two-thirds of the world’s population, 85% of global gross domestic product, 80% of global investment and over 75% of global trade.
* Headquarter
   * The G20 operates as a forum and not as an organization. Therefore, it does not have any permanent secretariat or management and administrative structure.
* Origin
   * 1997-1999 Asian Financial Crisis: This was a ministerial-level forum that emerged after G7 invited both developed and developing economies. The finance ministers and central bank governors began meeting in 1999.
   * Amid the 2008 Financial Crisis, the world saw the need for a new consensus-building at the highest political level. It was decided that the G20 leaders would begin meeting once annually.
* Members
   * The members of the G20 are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union.
   * One nation holds the Chair every year, known as the 'G20 Presidency'. Argentina chaired the G20 summit of 2018 and Japan for 2019.
* V-Shaped Recovery
   * A V-shaped recovery is characterized by a sharp economic decline followed by a quick and sustained recovery.
   * The recession of 1953 is an example of a V-shaped recovery.
   * A V-shaped recovery is different from an L-shaped recovery, in which the economy stays in a slump for a prolonged period.

### 3) International Judicial Conference 2020

The International Judicial Conference 2020 was held from 21st-23rd February 2020 in New Delhi.

* The Conference was organized by the Supreme Court of India.
* The theme of the Conference was ‘Judiciary and the Changing World’.
* Important Topics of discussion at the conference included :
   * Gender Justice,
   * Contemporary Perspectives on Protection of Constitutional Values,
   * Dynamic Interpretations of the Constitution in a Changing World,
   * Harmonization of Environment Protection vis-à-vis Sustainable Development and
   * Protection of Right to Privacy in the Internet Age.

#### Highlights from the Conference

* Sustainable Development: The Indian judiciary was appreciated for its balance between development and environment, and continued guidance in it.
   * E.g. Judgement on Sardar Sarovar Project
* Increased Accessibility: The Supreme Court was hailed for the “extraordinary effort” to make its judgments more accessible to the common man by making them available in nine vernacular languages, keeping in mind the nation’s linguistic diversity.
* Gender Justice: The recent directives for granting equal status to women in the Army, guidelines for preventing sexual harassment at the workplace, etc. were appreciated.
* Global Reference: The Chief Justice of India said that the Supreme Court’s judgments are cited by courts of other countries and have served as a “beacon of hope” to independent and developing nations.
   * A 2001 verdict of the South African court cited the Indian case of Narain Das Jain v Agra Nagar Mahapalika decided by the Supreme Court in 1991 to benchmark the compensation to be provided while acquiring land.
* Use of ICT: The need for technology was highlighted to deliver speedy justice.
* The Government is making an effort to connect every court of the country to the E-court Integrated Mission Mode Project. The establishment of the National Judicial Data Grid will make court procedures easier.
* Future Challenges: It was highlighted that issues like data protection and cybercrimes pose new challenges for the judiciary.

#### E-court Integrated Mission Mode Project

* The E-Courts Project was conceptualized based on the ""National Policy and Action Plan for Implementation of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in the Indian Judiciary - 2005"" submitted by the e-Committee of the Supreme Court of India (set up in 2004).
* The main objectives of the e-Court Project are as follows:
   * To provide efficient & time-bound citizen-centric service delivery.
   * To develop, install & implement decision support systems in courts.
   * To automate the processes to provide transparency of Information access to its stakeholders.
   * To enhance judicial productivity both qualitatively & quantitatively, to make the justice delivery system affordable, accessible, cost-effective & transparent.
* The e-Courts National portal (ecourts.gov.in) was launched in 2013. This provides Case Status, daily Case-list, Cases Filed and Cases Registered through the Case information System (CIS) Software.
* The National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) is a part of the e-Courts Integrated Mission Mode Project. It was launched in 2015. The aim is to track judicial performance across different courts in the country.
   * The NJDG is working as a National data warehouse for case data including the orders/judgments for Courts across the country.
   * NJDG works as a monitoring tool to identify, manage & reduce pendency of cases.
   * It also helps to provide timely inputs for making policy decisions to reduce delay and arrears in the system, facilitate better monitoring of court performance and systemic bottlenecks, and, thus, facilitate better resource management.
   * NJDG has specifically helped India improve its ranking in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Report.

### 4) Craspedotropis Gretathunbergae

A group of scientists has recently discovered a new species of land snail in Brunei.

* The new species reside in tropical rainforests and are sensitive to drought and extreme temperatures (which have become more frequent due to climate change).
* Hence as an honor to Swedish Climate Change activist Greta Thunberg, who has been making efforts to raise awareness about climate change, the new snail species was named Craspedotropis Gretathunbergae.
* Recently, a tiny species of beetle was also named after her as Nelloptodes Greta.
* In 2018, a new species of beetle (Grouvellinus Leonardodicaprioi) was named after the actor Leonardo DiCaprio (an American actor, producer, and environmentalist).

### 6) Joint Commands

Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) office is working on a tentative timeline for the establishment of joint commands among the three defense services Army, Navy and Air Force beginning with an Air Defence Command.

#### Joint Commands

* It is a unified command in which the resources of all the services are unified under a single commander looking at a geographical theatre.
* Meaning, a single military commander, as per the requirements, will have the resources of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force to manage a security threat.
* Functions of joint command:
   * The commander of a joint command will have the freedom to train and equip his command.
   * He will have the logistics of all the services at his beckoning.
   * However, the three services will retain their independent identities as well.
* Joint command at present:
   * There are two tri-services commands at the moment.
   * The joint command at the moment, the Andaman and Nicobar Command (ANC), is a theatre command, which is headed by the chiefs of the three services in rotation. It was created in 2001 after a Group of Ministers had given a report on national security following the Kargil War.
   * The Strategic Forces Command was established in 2006 and is a functional tri-services command.
* What is the structure right now?
   * There are 17 commands, divided among the three services.
   * The Army and the Air Force have seven commands each, while the Navy has three commands.
   * These commands report to their respective services and are headed by three-star officers.
   * Though these commands are in the same regions, they are no located together.
* Need for joint commands?
   * The leader of unified command has control over more varied resources, compared to the heads of the commands under the services now. And the officer commanding will have access to the Air Force’s fighter jets and can use them if needed. Through such integration and jointness, the three forces will be able to avoid duplication of resources. The resources available under each service will be available to other services too. The services will get to know one another better, strengthening cohesion in the defense establishment.
* Do the militaries of other countries have such commands?
   * Several major militaries are divided into integrated theatre commands. China’s People’s Liberation Army has five theatre commands: Eastern, Western, Northern, Southern and Central. Its Western Theatre Command is responsible for India. The US Armed Forces have 11 unified commands, of which seven are geographic and four functional commands. Its geographic commands are Africa, Central, European, Indo-Pacific, Northern, Southern, and Space. Cyber, Special Operations, Transportation and Strategic are its functional commands.

### 7) World’s largest cavefish discovered in Meghalaya

A team of experts from the UK, Switzerland, and India have discovered the world’s largest species of cavefish in Meghalaya’s Jaintia Hills.

#### About

* The cavefish, similar in anatomy to an endangered mahseer species, is around one and a half feet in length and was found inside a remote cave in Jaintia Hills.
* The fish has no eyes and is white due to a lack of melanin pigmentation.
* As they live in a nutrient-limited environment most of these species are small.

### 8) Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR)

* The State Government of Arunachal Pradesh intends to build a highway through the 862 sq km Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR) in East Kameng district.
* The Government had in the past built a highway through the Namdapha National Park.

#### Key Points

* The project is named the East-West Industrial Corridor which is a proposed elevated corridor at the tiger reserve, to be constructed at an estimated cost of Rs.2,550 crore.
* The highway aims to connect Bhairabhunda in West Kameng district and Myanmar in Changlang district along Arunachal Pradesh’s border with Assam.
* The argument over an elevated corridor at the PTR was that it can ensure the free movement of wild animals.
* The state government felt the project would enhance connectivity and develop the state’s foothill areas into economic and industrial zones.

#### Issue Area

* Trees may have to be felled and pillars erected from the ground. Petrol, diesel and other materials will be transported, leading to loss of natural habitat.
* This corridor will be a threat to the adjoining Nameri Tiger Reserve in Assam too.

#### What should the Govt. do?

* The Government, while building such a mega project, should consult renowned conservation organizations in the area and also bring all stakeholders who will be impacted by the project on to the negotiating table.

#### Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR)

* It lies in the foothills of the Eastern Himalaya in the East Kameng district of Arunachal Pradesh.
* It falls within the Eastern Himalaya Biodiversity Hotspot.
* Pakke is also the only Hornbill sanctuary in India.
* The vegetation is predominantly tropical semi-evergreen forest.
* What makes PTR special are the brilliant efforts of the Forest Department and local communities like that of the Nyishi Tribe who inhabit the area around the park to protect the wildlife here.

682,Policy/Economy,What the fuck is modi doing ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fmob0d/what_the_fuck_is_modi_doing/,"What the fuck is modi doing ? He's unfit to be leader of this country. 

He always touts his horns when representing india by elevating it as world largest democracy. 

Now what ? World's largest democracy' economy is probably will be in ruins by the time this is all over. 

As far as I have gathered:- 

He's not really giving people any financial support. He only urged people to not leave the disadvantaged behind. I understand that. But dude, even people who will be paying them will have no income stream left. 

So what maybe you pay your employees. Will your landlord be generous enough to forget your monthly payments. Maybe he is, but now even he has to pay property tax without any income stream.

He's not providing tax cuts or financing salaries of people. 

Now when this shit storm is all over he doesn't even have any policies if place if he decides a full lockdown. Many business will become bankrupt. Many company will be dissolved. It will be a period of unstable financial turmoil. Many life's will be ruined and that fucker will still not be accountable for all his action ( like erection of 3000 crore statue ) or rather his inaction. 

This could very well lead to another event like Great Depression. Without support from government many people will be laid off and many will become bankrupt. Industrial activities will be delayed as demands will be greatly reduced due to depletion of people's cash reserves."," None of this is new. He has always been doing PR giri only. It is not so much modi as the voting public, and lack of competent opposition. Yatha praja, tatha raja. Public who voted for him knew this already. You can't counter idiots with logic. They will still support him. Yes no one is talking about it. But I've seen many documentaries about our economic condition (I'm no expert but I've heard what experts been saying). This bubble was building up by the time of Congress but Manmohan was very smart. True that loans were high in that time too. But when you are in economic boom you're supposed to give loans to companies and take calculated risk. But now the loans are about 5-6 time higher, unemployment is 45 years high, bad loans have gone 3 to 9%. The bubble have been burst. Experts say normally it takes a decade to come out of this condition. That's why it is called lost decade.
Now it was before corona. Lol. Get ready to go into stone age guys. What can he do best ? He can charm the people to stay home. Most of his tv appearances in recent times have been very intense. I guess people take his words. 
What hurts me the most is where are the Ambani’s the Adanis the Virat Kohli’s the Dhoni’s the salmans the shahrukhs.  And the countless other billionaires of india.   They should come forward and donate money towards this epic fight against  Covid 19. Ghanta bajaao"

>* Nearly two months after Modi canceled the value of the two biggest bills in circulation  worth about $7.50 and $15  cash remains scarce and scores of people have reportedly died while waiting in line at banks and ATMs.

>* The misery has also taken subtler forms: migrant workers unable to send money home to their families, small businesses forced to close, a slowdown in sales of everything from SUVs to spinach.

>* It is unfathomable why some of the smartest minds and most competent officials were unable to see that the currency transfusion will be a complex, difficult, painful process full of unintended consequences, said Nitin Pai, co-founder of the Takshashila Institution, an independent policy research organization.

684,Policy/Economy,Ex-PM Manmohan Singh: The state of economy today is deeply worrying. Last quarter's GDP growth rate of 5% signals that were in midst of a prolonged slowdown. India has potential to grow at a much faster rate but all round mismanagement by Modi govt has resulted in this slowdown.,https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1168025028916465665?s=19,," Let's not forget, 5 is the biggest *answer* they could come up with. A colleague was saying ""educated people should never run country they cannot take brave steps like Modi does"".. People seriously don't care about economy all they care about is Pakistan and Kashmir. BJP is doing right ... We are fucked boys More on current situation:

>Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh: It is particularly distressing that the manufacturing sector's growth is tottering at 0.6%. This makes it very clear that our economy has not yet recovered from the man-made blunders of demonetisation and a hastily implemented GST. India cannot afford to continue down this path. Therefore, I urge the govt to put aside vendetta politics and reach out to all sane voices and thinking minds to steer our economy out of this man-made crisis.


In such distressed time for economy, even [few words](https://twitter.com/INCIndia/status/1168018140971905024?s=19), even a criticism (though he rarely criticize anybody) by him is like rain in drought...

Wish he had majority in parliament like the incumbent PM, wish he could implement his knowledge and experience to grow India into superpower... My father runs a business in the automotive industry and says that this is the worst slowdown he's seen is 25 years. He says even 2008 was better and that was during a global recession. Factories halting or running 2/7 days, bodyshops shutting down or halting orders etc(throughout India). These are really troubling times. I hope that change is forced quickly or we'll stunt ourselves for a really long time. I don't know how competent the people in charge of the decisions regarding finances are. 

You just pick anyone random and make him/her the finance Minister. I know they don't make the decisions themselves, have a team of supposedly experts behind them, but I won't be surprised if the so called experts may also just be bootlickers rather than competent individuals.

And it should not be tough to find competent people in our country. Check out the comments in any article reporting the same.. bhakths out in full force abusing him..to solve a problem you have to admit that you have one. Cow economics and ram mandir finally taking effect. Acche din bros. He's not wrong. This guy is hands down *the* greatest Prime Minister the country has ever had. No politics, no drama, no braggadocio, no bullshit. He wasn't tainted by crises like Indira Gandhi or Nehru, either. He was all work and no talk. He singlehandedly pulled India out of the mouth of a potential economic depression in 1991 and helped set it on the right track as Prime Minister. 2004 to 2009 saw stratospheric economic growth and even 2009-2014, despite the global financial turbulence, was pretty impressive. No amount of praise will be enough for his contributions to India's growth story. 

But, today's hateful, terrorist-electing India doesn't deserve him. Today's India deserves Yogi Adityanath, Sakshi Maharaj, Pragya Singh Thakur, Amit Shah and that failed theater actor-cum-riot-monger.

PS: Enjoy the Hindutva way of running an economy, India. Just another 5 years. Or maybe 50. Make the most of it anyway. Condition of bhakturds in 4 months of Modi 2.0 
https://twitter.com/free_thinker/status/1168042369909805057 Man, I miss good old of Days of Manmohan Singh.. Remember we used to have an economy ? Now what we have is just shit and giggles I think after the end of this term Modi will have a hard time gaining popularity. Mody govt how to solve -- DENY Could anyone estimate how low the GDP will be if we had the old non fudged formula?? We chutiya Indians deserve such economy.. We all are bullyish in nature and we don't care about actual growth. We will make fun of your introvertedness and will laud extrovertedness of Modi even though he know shit. Though if you have said two words when the corruption was high in Congress, we wouldn't have given or even consider BJP. bjp didn't came bcoz of mandir and cows, but it came bcoz of people being fedup with your untolerable silence towards the shameful corruption

You were too much introvert and the current one is too much extrovert. No balance in between Sadhus are becoming CMs. What do you expect? The comments as usual are cancer. The job market is so fucked already, can't imagine how much more worse it can get C'mon now , someone should come up with solutions! Amd BJP govt should fucking accept it and implement it ! Nirmala Sitharaman's response for any question about the economy is acting all haughty and telling the finance secretary to answer it Oh so now he talks! If this man would have been allowed to rule unhindered from the Gandhi duo he would have completely transformed the country. Man, I miss the golden era of booming growth of the 70s. Overall economy - worldwide, has slowed down. But don't let that stop you from selective blaming and faux outrage."

Also,why is India still a developing nation when our history is longer than say,the USA?(as far as my knowledge goes,which isn't much)

I'm just curious.I'm not trying to demean anyone or any culture."," >Also,why is India still a developing nation when our history is longer than say,the USA?(as far as my knowledge goes,which isn't much)

Did you miss 150 years of colonism which existed till 1947?

India, as an independent nation and a free economy has existed only for 70ish years. 

Our economic policies have also been flawed for a large party of our history. Idealism, corruption and incorrect policies had pretty much shackled the economy until 1990.

Despite liberalising the economy later, we still had massive growths from 1990s onwards (the quality of the growth is whole another matter) The mentality is bad. Agreed. 
Development of a country is based on industrialization, income per capita, GDP, literacy and other such aspects, not history. So even though we have  a richer history, we lack in every other aspect. This is an Asian problem not an ""Indian"" problem, this is because our opinions are heavily influenced by our parents and the older you become the more conservative you get so your children too are conservative. I think many people in india have this kind of ultra conservative mentality because of our education system, in short, it makes people rote learn rather teaching them to think critically.

Also, in india still has low literacy rate of about 74% as of 2011 census. In 2011 census population of India was 1.21 billion(121 crore), so we have about 300 million(30 crore) people who are illitrate in 2011, so the number illitrate people in india in 2011 is almost equal to the entire population of USA.

India still remains as developing country even after more than 70 years of independence can be blamed to bad govt policies, corruption, the mentality of people and the worst one being population explosion. 

To get an idea how insanely fast population of India increased : In 1951 census the population of India was 361 million(36.1 crore), in 1961, it was 439 million(43.9 crore), 1971 it was 548 million(54.8 crore), in 1981, it was 683 million(63.8 crore), in 1991 it was 846 million(84.6 crore), 2001, it was 1029 million(102.9 crore), in 2011, it was 1210 million(121 crore). Presently, 2019 it is about 1370 million(137 crore).

So since independence we have added about 1 billion people to this country. So we need a lot of resources just to sustain the existing population. Now to add insult to the injury, we also had, many bad govt policies, corrupt politicians, who only look for their personal gains, rather than focusing on the development of the nation. Not related to your questions, but add a space after a punctuation (period, comma). Its always Shashak  Sewak mentality still rampant in India . Judiciary , bureaucracy , defence , industry etc. ,everywhere you will find this culture . 

As long as we don't accept everybody equal , how can we expect our society to grow ."

Many households and companies find it difficult to cope with the current lockdown situation. As important as it is to get work turning out, it is more important to ensure the safety and well-being of all our employees. Fortunately, we at Lohono Stays have managed to tackle the challenge caused by this pandemic. Realising the density of the situation soon enough, we were able to proactively apply the work from home policy.

&#x200B;

Applying the work from home policy well in time, helped us safeguard the interests of all our team members. However, this was not the smoothest ride. Considering our operations run in over 4 locations across India and South East Asia, we had to ensure that everybody was secure. We ensured that every staff member or villa member staying at our luxury holiday homes received the bare necessities to get through these quarantined times in perfect health. To enhance the productivity of all our team members, our CEO, Mr. Nibhrant Shah personally suggests good articles to read and encourages all to build on their skillset. Our team members are also encouraged to take up online courses, better yet we are setting up online MasterClasses for them. These will help all team members to learn and grow every day.

Our team is constantly working on improving the sanitation and comfort offered at our villas for rent in Goa, luxury villas in Lonavala, Coonoor villas for rent and private villas for rent in Alibaug. We want to be able to immediately get back into action as soon as things are up and running again. We at Lohono Stays, urge everyone to stay safe and stay at home. This battle can only be won by everyone staying indoors.

688,Policy/Economy,India's forsaken IT / BPO and other professionals post COVID-19 breakout and Lock-down.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fqqi9p/indias_forsaken_it_bpo_and_other_professionals/," As of 5th of March NASSCOM had sought permission from Govt to allow Work from Home [WFH](https://www.google.com/amp/s/m.economictimes.com/news/economy/policy/coronavirus-nasscom-urges-govt-to-allow-techies-to-work-from-home/amp_articleshow/74487287.cms) to deal with COVID-19 & permission granted by the 13th of March. Most of the IT companies did start allowing Work from Home (wfh) for a majority of their employees. But some were left out from this under the pretext of essential work for banks such as Wells Fargo. They were forced to work from Office and only after much hue and cry and police raids did they allow the employees to take the desktops home as late as 24th March. This has opened a scope for the spread virus since the virus can still be transmitted amongst employees with out the employee showing any sign.

It has also come to notice that unofficially many employees were threatened of pay cut if they are unable to take the desktops home in spite of 24th Mar lockdown.


The pertinent question arises as to what happens when these employees and their families are found to be infected..? Will they have complete access to health care under company policy? But then, what about their family?

How will they manage their expense if there is mass lay-offs? Given that they are considered too rich to receive ration from govt and too poor to receive grants in the form of bail-outs.

Signs are not encouraging, given that top officials of [corporates](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2020-03-25/billionaires-want-people-back-to-work-workers-aren-t-so-sure) (including retired) are not providing encouraging statements (though overseas it will have rippling affect in India) & many companies [like this](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/coronavirus-impact-future-groups-kishore-biyani-in-a-difficult-situation-as-lenders-invoke-shares-report-5070601.html/amp) are already finding excuse of pre-existing loans which signals deferment  of salary pay, for many if not all.

**Indian economy: From policy paralysis to investment paralysis**

Last week Prime Minister Narendra Modi joined the ongoing rhetorical debate on the state of the Indian economy with a strong defence of his government’s actions over the last three years. Among other things, his intervention put the spotlight on the Indian economy—something long overdue, but not for the rhetorical charges that are being flung around on both sides.

If indeed there is a pithy way of summarizing the state of affairs suffice to say that the country’s economy has transitioned from a state of policy paralysis (which identified the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance or UPA) to one of investment paralysis.

Both are cause for worry but for entirely different reasons. One was the outcome of a government which, for whatever reasons, went into a policy funk with disastrous consequences.

The other is the result of structural disruptions—some of which, like spiralling bad loans with banks, are a legacy of the UPA regime and a few induced by policy changes, like the rollout of the goods and services tax (GST) and demonetization of high value currencies, undertaken over the last three years.

So while one arose from inaction, the other is largely a fallout of not anticipating or reacting in time to address the disruptions arising from hitting the reset button on the economy.

It is important to grasp this distinction. Alternatively, there is a risk of being overwhelmed by the rhetorical claims and counterclaims on the economy; and missing the woods for the trees as it were.

As such the economy is not doing as badly as the opposition is claiming—especially with almost every agency forecasting a rebound in economic growth, albeit marginal, in subsequent quarters. Most importantly, macroeconomic stability has been restored. On the other hand, it is certainly not performing to potential—which some argue is around 8-8.5%—as the government’s spin doctors are arguing.

This potential can be tapped only if the investment levels, which have dropped to worrisome lows, recover. But this is easier said than done. The legacy of bad debts or what Arvind Subramanian, chief economic adviser, describes as the twin balance sheet problem (because it affects the books of both companies and the banks who extended the loans) is not something that can be resolved overnight.

Alongside the disruptions caused by structural policy responses like GST are causing considerable pain. As the old business structures built over seven decades are replaced, rather abruptly in some cases, the new systems are not up and ready to take over—indeed, execution of ideas is where this government has erred. It is the fallout of this transition, which is lending hope to critics and a cause for worry to the government.

In a column published in Mint last week, Indira Rajaraman, alluded to this phenomenon very succinctly. According to her, GST has completely recast the existing risk-sharing mechanism, dealing a death blow to retail trade volumes. The solution, like Rajaraman argued, is not to backtrack on GST (as some political parties are suggesting), but instead to fix the anomaly through tweaks (one of which was accepted by the GST Council on Friday by putting in place quarterly filing of returns, instead of every month).

Similarly, the government’s anti-corruption initiatives are forcing a transition to a more transparent transactions framework—exactly why real estate, which thrived on unaccounted cash, is in such doldrums. Here too, the alternative framework has been slow to evolve and the government and other institutions like the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are guilty of not pushing hard on walking the country through the required behavioural change.

The Economist Intelligence Unit in a note issued last week said as much.

“The deceleration in bank credit growth to industry is partly attributable to the RBI’s initiatives and the Bharatiya Janata Party’s efforts to reduce corruption at higher levels of business and government. However, the difficult business environment and slow-moving judicial system will make the transition to a more market-driven financial system extremely difficult,” and then added, “We believe that a revival in private investment depends on the government injecting additional capital to banks’ balance sheets, but also on companies readjusting their business models to the new financial system.”

In the final analysis, it can safely be said that the attention to the economy is welcome, but reducing it to a political blame game is not. And looking at a new and rapidly transforming India through a conventional lens is a bad idea.

The Union government, which has visibly begun its countdown to the 2019 general election as well as elections to key state assemblies like Gujarat, may be tempted to hit the panic button.

Even though politically expedient, it would be very myopic in terms of the long-term health of the Indian economy.

	1.	Are NRC and CAA separate?

Yes. 

NRC is not a law, It is a process mandated by  the Indian Citizenship ( Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules 2003.
Source

But are they connected? 

YES.

Since any rules issued from time to time by the government are taken into consideration while interpreting any law. In fact there is a clause in every Act specifying the same, in our case, Section 18 of the Indian Citizenship Act 1955.

Source

	2.	What is the CAA, how can it be misused?

(a) CAA and why it’s unconstitutional

The core idea is to make it easier for  undocumented immigrants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan to get Indian citizenship. The catch is that these immigrants can’t be Muslims.

Are there really ‘persecuted minorities’ that would benefit from this legislation?

Yes, 31,313 individuals to be precise.
This was revealed by the government itself during a hearing by a parliamentary committee on the 2016 version of the Bill. The committee had asked how many people would benefit from the legislation. The Intelligence Bureau replied:


But by specifically excluding Muslims (and Jews), the Bill has raised justified concerns that the Modi government is trying to enshrine religious discrimination into law. 

This when Article 14 of India’s constitution prohibits discrimination on religious basis.

Why does this Act violate Article 14?

Article 14 is Equality of Law.

‘the state shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of laws within the territory of India prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth’

The opposition MPs had pointed this out but Amit Shah insisted the exception to Article 14, “reasonable classification” when making laws. 

In simple words the State can discriminate between citizens on above grounds if special benefits are offered to them for eg; reservations for marginalised communities.

This matter of whether “reasonable classification” is justified is why the Act is being contended in the Courts and will be decided later.

(b) How can CAA be misused?

CAA can be amended only by parliamentary procedures. 

The government has said that the amendment was made to provide remedy to the six communities namely Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian community from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan seeking shelter from religious persecution or fear of religious persecution.

However, religious persecution is not cited anywhere in the CAA, 2019. The bare act reads:

""Provided that any person belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian community from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan, who entered into India on or before the 31st day of December, 2014 and who has been exempted by the Central Government by or under clause (c) of sub-section (2) of section 3 of the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 or from the application of the provisions of the Foreigners Act, 1946 or any rule or order made thereunder, shall not be treated as illegal migrant for the purposes of this Act;"" 



Religious persecution is actually mentioned under the Rules to the amended Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920.



This is very important to understand because the Government can make changes to these rules anytime they want. Rules are basically subordinate laws that the central government can issue through a gazette notification at any time. These laws do not require the approval of the parliament.


*The above point will be important while explaining NRC.

3. What is the NRC?

The National Register of Citizens (NRC) is a registry maintained by the Government of India containing names & certain relevant information for identification of Indian citizens. 

The Nationwide NRC is as a process already underway through the NPR, which is proposed to be implemented in the 2021 census.

(a) What is the NPR?

The NPR is a list of “usual residents of the country”. According to the Ministry of Home Affairs, a “usual resident of the country” is one who has been residing in a local area for at least the last six months, or intends to stay in a particular location for the next six months. 

Unlike the NRC, the NPR is not a citizenship enumeration drive, as it would record even a foreigner staying in a locality for more than six months.
 It is mandatory for every “usual resident of India” to register in the NPR.

The NPR will collect both demographic data and biometric data. There are 15 different categories of demographic data, ranging from name and place of birth to education and occupation, that the RGI is supposed to collect in the NPR. 

For biometric data it will depend on Aadhaar, for which it will seek Aadhaar details of the residents. This will allow the Union government, for the first time, to connect their biometric details with information like the birthplace of their parents.

Apart from this, in a test run going on across the country, the RGI is seeking details of mobile number, Aadhaar, PAN card, Driving Licence, Voter ID card and passport (in case the resident is Indian). It is also working to update the Civil Registration System of birth and death certificates.

Even as issues of privacy associated with Aadhaar continue to be debated in the country, the NPR is on a drive to collect detailed data on residents of India. With the recent introduction of Personal Data Protection Bill, in which the Centre exempts its agencies from some or all provisions of the proposed bill there are a lot of red flags being raised about misuse of such data.

Source

(b) How is NPR linked to the NRC?

The legal framework for the National Population Register is grounded in the Citizenship Act, 1955. In 2003, the Act was amended by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led BJP government to introduce the category of an “illegal migrant”. To implement this amendment, a set of rules were issued. 

(The link to the rules is the same as 1. Are CAA and NRC different)

The rules read: “The Central Government shall, for the purpose of National Register of Indian Citizens, cause to carry throughout the country a house-to-house enumeration for collection of specified particulars relating to each family and individual, residing in a local area including the Citizenship status”.

How would these registers of citizens be created? The rules explicitly spell it out: 

“The Local Register of Indian citizens shall contain details of persons after due verification made from the Population Register.”

When the Local Register is generated from the Population Register, a “verification process” would be carried out which would create the category of “doubtful citizenship”. 

The final National Register of Citizens would be prepared by asking doubtful citizens to prove they are Indians as part of a “claims and objections” process.

This Population Register mentioned in the rules is nothing other than the National Population Register.

Link
 In a gazette notification issued on July 31, 2019, the Modi government passed an order to “prepare and update the Population Register” in every state other than Assam.

(c) Arguments against NRC.

	(i).	A botched exercise in Assam

The National Register of Citizens in Assam was updated over the past few years to identify undocumented migrants who had come mostly from Bangladesh after 1971. 

The updated NRC was supposed to document all those people whose names were listed in the NRC of 1951 and were still alive as well as their living descendants who could prove they were permanent residents of the state.

It was a botched exercise. There were many errors during the process.
Source

 In all, around 19 lakh people in Assam were excluded from the final register. 
Source

Soon, the BJP started complaining that many undocumented immigrants had been included in the register, while around five lakh Bengali Hindus were excluded. In fact, even some people who had campaigned for the BJP found themselves excluded.

Source: BJP complaining about a botched NRC
Source: 5 lakh Bengali Hindus excluded in NRC
Source: BJP campaigners find themselves excluded

Anyone who is not able to prove citizenship under NRC is put in detention centres.
Reports of the violation of Human rights in these detention centres is alarming.

Source: A newborn died in a detention centre in Assam. Their mother was later found not to be a foreigner.


	(ii).	Loopholes and inconsistencies in the existing citizenship laws

There is a lot of speculation around cut off dates and proving of ancestry based on the pilot NRC launched in Assam but nothing concrete so far can be determined since the nation wide Bill hasn’t been drafted.

But one thing we know for sure - every person resident in India will be required to prove their citizenship.

How does one prove their citizenship?

This is where matters get complex.

If we don’t consider the speculated ancestry provision which may or may not be included in the nation wide NRC, The current law for citizenship is as follows -


The Citizenship Act defines a citizen as:

Section 3:

Citizenship by birth —

(1) Except as provided in sub-section (2), every person born in India,—
(a) on or after the 26th day of January, 1950, but before the 1st day of July, 1987;

(b) on or after the 1st day of July, 1987, but before the commencement of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003 and either of whose parents is a citizen of India at the time of his birth;

(c) on or after the commencement of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003, where—
(i) both of his parents are citizens of India; or
(ii) one of whose parents is a citizen of India and the other is not an illegal migrant at the time of his birth, 

shall be a citizen of India by birth.

Short of this is,

If you were born in India before 1987 but after 1950, you are a citizen.

If you were born after 1987 but before 2003 and either of your parents are Indian citizens, you are a citizen.

If you were born after 2003 and both your parents are Indian citizens or one of your parents is an Indian citizen and the other is not an illegal immigrant, you are a citizen.

So if you were born before 1987, you’re an Indian citizen by birth.

If you’re born after 1987 you have to prove that your parents are Indian citizens. (What about the orphans?)

How do you do it?

If you’re born before 1987, you can prove citizenship by provision of birth certificate or other documents as may be prescribed by the NRC.

Assuming your parents were educated and organised enough they would be able to preserve your birth certificate and other such documents but people from lower middle class or slightly under privileged backgrounds may not have done the same because they weren’t educated and informed enough about the importance of these documents. This leaves a person in a state of handicap.


If you’re born after 1987, considering that  almost 44% of India’s population is under  24 years of age and a total 85% of the population is under 54 years of age, we can safely conclude the above group constitutes a large chunk of India’s population.

You have to prove that at least one of your parents is an Indian citizen. So if you’re born after 1987 naturally your parents are born before 1987. You’ll have to provide the necessary documents of YOUR PARENTS
to prove THEY’RE Indian citizens. Basically they expect you to preserve and possess documents dating back to as much as the 1960’s.

Many news agencies are reporting that mere submitting of passports and Aadhar cards shall suffice and THIS IS ABSOLUTELY FALSE.

Mere submitting of passports, birth certificate shall not suffice to prove citizenship, this was ruled by Bombay high court in 2013.
Source

In conclusion,
67% of our population is still rural as per the 2015 census. This coupled with inadequate infrastructure and lacking admin capacities to implement a nationwide program like this would be a disaster.

	(iii).	Why NRC promotes inequality against the Muslims?

Imagine a scenario where a nationwide NPR is rolled out. The babus administering the exercise mess up and end up sending a whole bunch of people  of all faiths a “specified proforma” from the register. 


Now, a legal recourse is available only to people of the six religions mentioned in the CAA. Do note that the law specifically says that people belonging to these faiths “shall not be treated as illegal migrants"". Muslims, however, will not have any such recourse. For that matter, even Jews won’t be able to do anything about their exclusion from the register. 

As a result, lakhs and crores of excluded people might have to declare that they are illegal immigrants to become Indian citizens again.

The tricky part is proving religious  persecution in another country.

To benefit from the CAA, the person issued a specified proforma by the NPR must prove that, one, they are a non-Muslim migrant from Afghanistan, Pakistan or Bangladesh, 

and, two, that they came to India to escape religious persecution. 

*(read with the point mentioned in CAA) But because the Government can make the rules under the Passport Act essentially at whim, the government can simply strike out the second condition and keep only the first.

	(iv).	Economic cost

The Global economy is on a slowdown and India is no exception to it, I generally never attribute GDP numbers with a Government since the only active participation of a Government in a GDP is via public expenditure which is still crucial. However, when a Government actively makes policies which are detrimental to the state of the economy, then fingers will be pointed.

This is the case with NRC.

 In Assam alone it cost 1220 crores - 1500 crores and ended up in a massive failure.
Source:
 
The national cost of implementing the NRC would run into lakhs of crores. With the Indian economy in its current situation, implementing NRC would surely leave a visible dent on the Indian economy. Especially when there is absence of any ROI (Return on Investment) from such a policy.

The estimated cost of this might be close to 2-3 lakh crores (unverified).

Source: This is an opinion piece and the figures may have the effect of being inflated or underestimated.

Say, it costs 3 lakh crores, it’s still just 1.57% of our last year’s GDP i.e. $2.72 Trillion.

However, just like Demonetisation this act will bring the country to a halt. People will have to line up yet again at verification centres, for document verification, follow ups & enquiries. 

In Assam, the NRC updating started on July 30, 2018 and ended on August 31, 2019 and despite taking over an year to complete this process, the entire process ended up in material inconsistencies and glaring errors.
Source:

A nation-wide implementation would cost years in loss of productivity and the economic cost of this practice would be dangerous.

Demonetisation caused the GDP growth to drop to 6.1%, though it recovered in the later quarters and consumption patterns stabilised too.
Source:.

Over 1.5 million jobs were lost in Q3 of FY 2016-17 post implementation of demonetisation.
Source CMIE report.

The nation wide implementation of NRC will have a similar or larger impact on the economy but this time it will come with a substantial human cost.

	(v).	Cost of Error

The NRC exercise would be highly prone to error—both Type I and Type II. 

Explanation:

Type I errors:  False positives 

Mistakenly identifying a person as an immigrant from protected minority communities such as Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan, and erroneously giving them the benefit of Indian citizenship. 

Immigrants are usually a net economic benefit; so the costs of Type I errors are only confined to national security. 

These costs are not nationwide and typically limited to a handful of border districts in India.


Type II errors: False negatives

These occur when those who qualify as Indian citizens are mistakenly categorized as illegal immigrants. A nationwide NRC, if similar to the one in Assam, would imply that false negatives get sent to detention centres or deported.

Type II errors are extremely costly. To minimize false negatives, the bar to qualify as a citizen has to be very simple and easily identifiable. 

Also, infrastructure to scrutinize the paperwork for the NRC has to be exceptionally efficient. 

The Indian state usually fails on both counts. Given the CAB’s current religious exclusionary basis, Muslims are at higher risk of exclusion through false negatives, though all groups, including Hindus, are likely to be affected by errors.


There are three main issues to consider here. 


The first is the trade-off between Type I and Type II errors. 

If, to avoid false positives, the government has a high level of scrutiny for NRC inclusion, all individuals will have the burden of meeting this higher bar. In the process, some might be mistakenly excluded. 

On the other hand, if the bar is set very low to prevent false negatives and erroneous exclusions, then some illegal immigrants may slip through the cracks. 
The current CAB framework, combined with the NRC, is set up to minimize false positives, which will automatically increase false negatives.


The third issue is of the magnitude of error.

1) If Govt executes well with 5% error, 67.5 million people will be displaced (equalling displacement by WW II)

2) If it has Aadhaar error rate (8.8%) 120 million will be left out.

3) If it has 1% error, still 13.5 million Indians will be displaced (same as partition of India)

Both the source materials for the data above are opinion pieces since the numbers can only be estimated as of now and should be read accordingly.

Opinion -
There are a lot of narratives around the CAA and NRC but one thing that we need to stress on too is that illegal immigrants coming to India are disenfranchised and very poor.

In this subsection you should mention the Assam exception as the rules are different for them. This is great work! Finally something objective and reliable! Hey.. I’m an Indian Muslim and the last 3 months in India have been a complete nightmare. I saw your post a while back and really appreciated the time you took to lay everything down with sources, easy to absorb. For a while I tried to get other people to read it too, but most people aren’t really readers, and not into politics either, especially if it doesn’t affect them directly. 

So it inspired me to create a YouTube video with sources, much like yours. I tried to keep it entertaining (without being inappropriate), and sprinkled it with pop culture memes and animations. So even if people weren’t politically inclined, they watched it. 

I couldn’t fit all your points into it, as it was too long. But I just wanted to extend my deepest gratitude for your post, as this is where the video really began.

In case you’re interested to see it: [India: CAA NRC WTF](https://youtu.be/AqwQiSy01CE) I am opposing CAA but this is wrong. There are around 1.4 million Hindus in Assam already who would benefit from this."

Looks like we will be back to the country placing their wishes before 33 million Gods and hoping for a miracle.

Already RBI is signalling about imminent 2nd wave of NPAs. OPEC had lowered the price of oil to beggar shale oil revolution. As shale company bankruptcies rise, OPEC might decide to raise oil price. That will make everybody shit their pants.

In a growing economy, where the size of the pie is increasing, a billion people ignore the daily slights and the frictions. I don't like to visualize the situation as the bubble bursts. > Dark clouds loom over the economy, but, ­paradoxically, this is a result not of any policy paralysis. Decision-making is speedy—perhaps too much so—but the hand on the wheel is unsteady. The absence of a competent manager of key economic policies sticks out as a sore thumb. The government betrays a flaky approach to economic policy and complete ignorance about macroeconomic levers. But no one dares to say so openly. 

In addition to the lack of expert economists at the helm of our economy, we have an extremely vindictive and malicious admin that does not hesitate to persecute and harass anyone who disagrees with them. 

Who will agree to work on those terms?

692,Policy/Economy,SOS: 3 ways how the DoT can help #FlattenTheCurve #Covid19,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fkomvp/sos_3_ways_how_the_dot_can_help_flattenthecurve/,"https://preview.redd.it/xl5x0otkbfn41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=e129292a378cf251da1f916f9dcdf9ed02cb6cbd

### Tl;dr

Access to good quality internet has never been more important than right now. With most experts unanimous on the need for  social distancing and many workplaces putting into place work from home plans, voice and data connectivity become critical. To ensure that high quality bandwidth is available to all parts of India we have suggested specific steps to be taken by the Department of Telecom. 

### ""We the people..."", of the Internet

Due to the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Union Government is taking various policy measures to safeguard the health and welfare of all Indians as per an advisory by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare titled, “*Advisory on Social Distancing Measure in view of spread of COVID-19 disease*” ([**link**](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/SocialDistancingAdvisorybyMOHFW.pdf)). Point number 3 to this advisory recommends to, “*Encourage private sector organizations/employers to allow employees to work from home wherever feasible.*” A “work from home” measure is critical during this time to contain adverse economic impacts on individuals, companies and the entire Indian economy.

At the same time during this period many people are likely to undergo mental stress and will reach out to loved ones for comfort and support. Even for children, remote educational modes of learning will become vital at this time as schools are closed. Many such interests which require social distancing necessary to restrict the spread of Covid-19 are supported by the availability of telecom and data services. However, as is the case with such a measure we would like to highlight that there comes certain network capacity related risks which policymakers must respond to. 

A recent report in the New York Times, dated March 16, 2020 informs us that a work and learn from home set up, leads to considerable stress on underlying network infrastructure ([**link**](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/technology/coronavirus-working-from-home-internet.html)). This is because last mile home service networks are designed to handle traffic patterns which are considerably different to enterprise grade internet broadband networks. Moreover, Wi-Fi based home internet systems have their own set of challenges in terms of reliability and quality of service. 

### We need to have a plan to support each other

We urge for crucial policy measures by putting forth a comprehensive plan in coordination with appropriate government departments and ministries. We specifically suggest the following:

1. **Periodic reviews of telecom infrastructure** **constraints:** There is an urgent need for the DOT and TRAI to conduct assessments in consultation with large telecom and internet service providers on the capacity to carry voice and internet traffic. Separately, there's a need for authorities to engage with representatives from internet users both enterprise facing stakeholders and consumer facing stakeholders in challenges they may face in continuing their day to day activities online. All of these actions must nonetheless, uphold the spirit of net neutrality and not lead to discriminatory treatment of internet traffic.
2. **Encourage voluntary pledges by telecom companies:** We recommend that a voluntary pledge may be encouraged by the Union Government in which telecom and internet service providers decide to not terminate services of any residential or small business users because of their inability to pay their bills due to disruptions caused specifically by COVID-19. 
3. **Ensure full and complete access at all times:** We urge that an advisory may be issued to all State Governments to halt any internet shutdowns or actions under the Telecommunications Suspension Rules, 2017 which are likely to increase hardship for people and organisations. This includes measures which slow down internet access speeds since that has the potential cripple economic activities.

We urge people from across the community (especially technical experts and small businesses) on if they have experienced any difficulties whilst accessing the internet, or using voice and video conferencing services. IFF will remain alert to the situation should it develop.

The Indians were in every facet of the economy & their expulsion led to a decline in the Ugandan economy. 

This is the same for other nationalisation policies such as in Zimbabwe, Kenya & South Africa. In all these cases training the locals with various skills & running businesses and entrepreneurship would have been more helpful and sustainable. Let us learn from their mistakes and train our people."," What's impact of this exercise on the economy? Imagine same money if they spend on education and hospitals, on the future of country. 

But now you end up looking at past, for docs, your documents, your parents documents and then grand parents. Digging grave will get you only skeletons. Better learn from what happened in Assam.

Summary: 

 Reject [#NRC](https://threadreaderapp.com/hashtag/NRC) in all states including Assam& NE. It's unacceptable that people from a state say that they want to be free to live/study/work/marry/settle in any part of India, BUT that they will not allow citizens from other states to live/study/work/marry/settle in their states. 

 [https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1224789632837021696.html](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1224789632837021696.html)"
694,Policy/Economy,"How I see the Pulwama Attacks, Abridged",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f3t8ip/how_i_see_the_pulwama_attacks_abridged/,"So an year ago, there was some intelligence input that there was a possibility of a terrorist attack. Naturally, they relayed the information over to our honourable Prime Minister the Great Narendra Modi. Now our beautiful Modi was so preoccupied with thinking out policies for the then Budget to boost our economy that he did not pay attention to it. Those stupid intelligence officers should have found a better time to inform our marvellous Modi, like, say, after February 14th.

Anyways, the CRPF men were planning to go to Srinagar from Jammu. Our fantastic Modi told them to take 78 vehicles so that the people would not miss the glory that is the Indian Army. Some fools raised possible security threat in going in a conspicuous 78 vehicle convoy. How dare they?! Shouldn't the people of India, especially those antinationalistic Kashmiris, see the glory of our Hindu nation?

Anyways, while they were moving, a car laden with explosives rammed into one of the vehicles, and the resulting blast killed 40 of our brave CRPF men. This act of terrorism irked our magnificient Modi, who meditated to let their souls rest in peace. During this meditation, Modi got a divine message. ""Those putrid Pakistanis committed this act. We must punish them."" Now this was divine, because even after a year, the NIA still has no clue where the bomb came from, while Modi understood it in a fraction of a second.

Anyways, our divine Modi swore revenge on the damned Pakistanis, and sent our brave Indian Army to Balakot to kill them. Our Indian Army dropped bombs there, killing several Pakistani terrorists. This was a very valiant move. I heard that a soldier was so brave that he gained the Vir Chakra for bravely getting his plane shot down and getting caught.

Anyways, the attack was a success. Exactly 420 terrorists died, including 256 antinational bacteria, 69 anti-Hindu fungi, 42 anti-Indian ferns, 31 anti-democratic trees, 13 Congress lizards, and 9 Muslim Crows. The satellite image in this [Reuters article](https://in.reuters.com/article/uk-india-kashmir-pakistan-airstrike-insi/satellite-images-show-madrasa-buildings-still-standing-at-scene-of-indian-bombing-idINKCN1QN02Z) should show all casualities. If you don't see all of them, including the bacteria, that means you're antinational. Get wrecked by NRC, you filthy Non-Bhakt.

Anyways, the intelligent people of India realised that our excellent Modi should rule India for decades to come. They saw that under our admirable Modi, we can regain the glory of our Vedic age, where there were satellites, where people used the internet, where people had nuke-laden arrows, where divine cows cure cancer, where women were trophies to be placed rightfully in kitchens, where we were proud of our caste system, where Dalits knew their place, where there were no Muslims and hence no terrorists, where kingship was hereditary; wait no, kingship can't be hereditary otherwise we'd be no different from those crazy Congressmen and even crazier Congresswomen, to say nothing of Congress-transgenders. So the Vedic age wasn't perfect, after all. Huh. You learn new things every day.

Anyways, this is my belief of what really happened in Pulwama. Hindustan zindabad.

&nbsp;

PS: /s for those who are incapable of understanding sarcasm. I'm just sad that 40 brave CRPF men died for Modi's selfish ambitions."," 1. Those brave men sacrificed themselves to their line of duty. 

2. Petty politicians milked the sacrifice of these brave men.

3. Airstrikes were a knee jerk response of cornered coward who was seeking a re-election to coveted post which ensured his position of power.

4. Incapable inept top brass of security cloaked their inefficiency behind those strikes. http://beta.dawn.com/news/223681/afzal-case-is-indian-govt-trying-to-bury-embarrassing-questions Well-written mate! Someone also has to write about the atrocities committed by our armed forces in J&K. They aren't all angels. And then Modi asks for votes in the name of Pulwama martyrs and Balakot.

695,Policy/Economy,Quick Explainer on how to actually read and understand the Budget and Economic Survey,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ex24ov/quick_explainer_on_how_to_actually_read_and/,"Before the deluge of talking heads and op-eds overwhelm you with their thoughts, here's a rough guide to independently understand 
what the budget and Economic Survey are saying. Source: am research scholar in Economics. 

1. Listen to the whole budget speech or read the transcript online (usually available on a ministry website after a few hours). Dealing directly with the budget speech is the best way not to be swayed by random claims.

2. Filter through the hawa-baazi. A good chunk of the budget speech will be dedicated to singing the government's praises. Ignore all of that; the budget is as much a political speech as it is an economic one.  Do make a note of what they claim to have done though, in order to cross-check later. 

3. Most crucially, listen to how they intend to fund any new schemes. Are they going to increase taxes? Will they just give out loans via PSBs? Do they hope to draw on CSR resources? Will they divert funds from existing schemes?  There are typically two parts to the budget speech: Part A and Part B. Part A is mostly what they intend to do, Part B is mostly about how they intend to raise the funds for it; i.e. the taxation tweaks. Part B in my opinion is more important, as the how of these schemes is as important as the why. 

4. Listen to multiple commentary sources. Big business interests will obviously praise any budget that makes their life easier, and will also obviously praise the government in general to facilitate easy business. Thus: question anything that they say without highlighting specific plus points. The same applies to government critics, professors etc: They (myself included) have biases that lend themselves to automatically assuming the worst of any decision made. 

5. Don't overhype the budget. Between data manipulation and upcoming elections, the budget is no longer the significant economic blueprint that it once was. The same applies to the Economic Survey. It is important, but no longer sufficient to gauge the direction of the economy and the government's economic policies.", To get the best picture of the Economic Survey and The Budget search for them on YouTube in context of UPSC Civil Services preparations. One surely get the better understanding of the different topic as the emphasis of the coaching institutes is on making aspirants understand different topic easily without getting too technical about it. where do i find their off-balance sheet borrowing numbers? Where the written budget will be available ??? Can you please send the link Any specific order in which all those documents available should be read for better understanding?

Dorsey said “we have policies around violent extremist groups,” but did not give a straightforward answer to the question. Dorsey did not respond to two requests for comment sent via Twitter DM.

.....

>The argument that external experts made to Motherboard aligns with what the Twitter employee aired: Society as a whole uncontroversially and unequivocally demanded that Twitter take action against ISIS in the wake of beheading videos spreading far and wide on the platform. The automated approach that Twitter took to eradicating ISIS was successful: “I haven’t seen a legit ISIS supporter on Twitter who lasts longer than 15 seconds for two-and-a-half years,” Amarnath Amarasingam, an extremism researcher at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, told Motherboard in a phone call. Society and politicians were willing to accept that some accounts were mistakenly suspended by Twitter during that process (for example, accounts [belonging to the hacktivist group Anonymous](https://www.theepochtimes.com/hackers-say-twitter-isnt-telling-the-whole-story-about-anti-terror-fight_1983519.html) that were reporting ISIS accounts to Twitter as part of an operation called #OpISIS were themselves banned).

The aftermath of the Delhi pogroms looks just as grim as the riots,  the only good thing being the absence of blood bath. The fascist forces are running campaigns titled SupportHinduEconomy, and its no surprise their proposal is to boycott of Muslim businesses esp in the riot affected areas. They post many deplorable things and I'll paste some of them here.   


>If you are a hindu then don't give your money to terrorist to spread terrorism.  To support Hindu and Hindu Economy always bought from hindus.

>Stop calling M electrician in house call Hindu electrician only. 

I can paste hundreds of such tweets ( this campaign has garnered 85.4k tweets) and I'm sorry if it makes you feel sick in the gut like it does to me.   
Twitter's inaction on these accounts makes me more worried. Twitter is excessively used to promote nazi like ideology here in India. Many of these campaigns are paid and Twitter is also a beneficiary of these campaigns.   
How can we make twitter more accountable here in India? My first suggestion would be for twitter to filter hate speech independently and block those accounts like it used to block ISIS' accounts.", No one cares

**Tl;dr**

IFF has responded to the call for public comments and suggestions by the Joint Committee on the Personal Data Protection (PDP) Bill, 2019 and sent across a submission on behalf of the #SaveOurPrivacy campaign. In it we have provided substantive inputs on essential privacy principles and a thematic analysis of major issues with the Bill. We have also appended a public brief containing a high-level clause by clause analysis of the Bill. Additionally, we have appended two issue specific briefs on (a) workplace surveillance and (b) the relationship between the PDP Bill and the National Population Register.   


**Essential First Principles**

As a first step we apprised the Committee that since the right to privacy as recognised by the Supreme Court also includes informational privacy this should be the primary lens through which the eventual law should be framed. In this regard, we also mentioned that the Supreme Court in the right to privacy judgement (*KS Puttaswamy v Union of India*) made the observation that the right to privacy subsists in public spaces as well. In this regard, we highlighted that a lot of users’ experiences online occur in certain corners of the internet which are public/semi-public in nature. Therefore, India’s data protection law must respect that and therefore accord adequate privacy protections in these domains  


In addition, we noted that the Joint Committee could shape India’s data protection law to incorporate the [**seven privacy principles**](https://saveourprivacy.in/principles) of the Indian Privacy Code, 2018 which was developed by the #SaveOurPrivacy campaign. These principles are based on the Hon’ble Supreme Court’s decision in KS Puttaswamy v Union of India and global examples like the European Union’s (EU’s) General Data Protection Regulation. The seven privacy principles emphasise that individual rights should be at the center of privacy and data protection and that the government should respect user privacy. They also address the need for the creation of a strong supervisory authority; and for surveillance reform.   


**Major Concerns that should be addressed by the Committee**

Subsequently we have done a thematic analysis of our top substantive concerns with the PDP Bill. This includes but is not limited to themes such as:  


*1.    Inclusion and treatment of social media intermediaries in the Bill*

The Bill requires social media platforms identified as “significant data fiduciaries” to set up infrastructure which allows users in India to voluntarily verify their accounts. This measure hampers online anonymity and thereby the right to privacy. Additionally, it will allow social media entities to access people's government issued identity documents. This can lead to aggregation of demographic information across different social media companies and databases. This creates immense scope for companies to build granular user profiles and commercialise personal and sensitive personal data of individuals. **We therefore ask the Committee to remove this provision from the PDP Bill**.  


*2.*   *Need for a chapter on surveillance reform*

Presently, India does not have sufficient privacy safeguards in place when it comes to surveillance carried out by the government. The frameworks currently in place (under India’s Information Technology Act and the Telegraph Act) are geared towards national security and fail to adequately protect privacy. In particular there is a lack of sufficient institutional or legislative oversight. **Thus, we have proposed that there is a need for a separate chapter on surveillance reform in the Bill along the lines of the Indian Privacy Code, 2018**.  


*3.*   *Exceptions for central government to access non-personal data*

A provision in the PDP Bill (Clause 91) provides a carve-out for the Central Government to access anonymised or non-personal data to frame policies in the interest of its digital economy. Such provisions show that the proposed law is far more interested in treating data as a resource. **We believe that a data protection law should not be used as a legislative backdoor to commodify data**.  


*4.   Issues with proposed structure of the Data Protection Authority (DPA) and the accompanying appellate structure*

* The selection committee consists of secretary-level officials. Two issues that arise here are of: i) accountability (these are neither democratically elected nor judicial members), and ii) diversity (it doesn’t reflect executive, judicial and external expertise). **Thus, we have proposed having an open call for applications and for the selection committee to have be inclusive in terms of representation**.
* We have noted that the Bill **impairs the independence of the DPA** by allowing the Government to frame policies which will be binding on them.
* To ensure quicker and localised decision making, we have proposed having **state and regional DPA benches**.
* We think that as things stand, the Appellate Tribunal would lack transparency. To that end, we have **proposed that it must publish all its decisions**.   


*5.*   *The “reasonable purposes” exemption which allows personal data to be processed without consent for reasonable purposes under Clause 14 of the Bill.*

The exemptions granted under this clause are fairly wide. It classifies publicly available personal data as under the “**reasonable purposes**” category. We think that this is a backdoor towards profiling and allow collation of demographic/individual sentiments on issues. We also think this would allow the government (and other powerful data fiduciaries) to aggregate social networking activities without the need for individual consent. The right to privacy is applicable in public spaces. Therefore, we proposed that this **provision be removed from the reasonable purposes exception since it is an excessive encroachment on people’s privacy in public spaces**.  


In addition to these themes, there are also other major issues with the Bill that we have discussed at length in our submission. The #SaveOurPrivacy collective has also authored briefs and explainers on different areas of the PDP Bill. We are sharing them with the JPC, the public and other relevant stakeholders in the hope that our analysis can inform future outcomes.

698,Policy/Economy,"Anti-national, who me? Anti-""Hindu-Nation""-al, certainly!",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ee6xey/antinational_who_me_antihindunational_certainly/,"**The goal of** ***Hindutva*** **is the religious conversion of India.**

Call me a pessimist, but I believe that the BJP is actually benefiting from the CAA+NRC protests. Call me paranoid, but I think that Modi and Shah will use the chaos in the nation to justify even more fascist measures.

Fascism relies on the dichotomy of ‘us and them’. ‘We’, the caste Hindus, led by a strong patriarch, versus the Muslims (who are really Pakistani infiltrators and/or terrorists; dirty, conniving sub-humans who want to destroy Hindustan) and the Christians (a lot of them Dalits, who ‘belong’ to Hindus but are taking away Hindu college seats and jobs, leading the country to shit, while they should be cleaning our shit).

This is *Hindutva*: hatred and ignorance masquerading as a political philosophy. Not socialism, social democracy, liberalism or conservatism, but hate. These philosophies, whatever their merits or demerits may be, take effort and dedication and love of the subject to study. Hindutva requires only hate. Forget Hindu texts, they don’t even have to study the Constitution. Doing so takes effort, you see. Hating and lynching is far easier.

This is why saffron-toting goons stop Muslims (and in [one unforgettable instance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJfvp59Kufs), Kanhaiya Kumar) and force them to chant “Jai Shree Ram”; this is why Amit Shah dehumanizes Bangladeshi migrants to “termites”; why Narendra Modi says the protesters can be recognized from their clothes.

Why abrogation of Article 370, why the blackout and human rights violations in Kashmir, why the abnormal Modia focus on Pakistan, why Ram Mandir, why NRC, why CAA? The message is clear: Muslims are not Indians, and they cannot stay. India is a Hindu Rashtra.

*But what about our Preamble? What happened to ‘sovereign socialist secular democratic republic’? What of Article 14, Article 15? Our Fundamental Rights?*

Okay, maybe we aren’t ‘socialist’ or ‘secular’ anymore. But from a young age we have been reading and hearing these words. “Unity in diversity.” “United we stand, divided we fall.” “India is the world’s largest democracy.” “We are a secular country.” “Indians are known for their hospitality.”

From our youth, the Idea of India is ingrained in us. And Hindutva -- hatred, really -- has attacked the very core of Indian-ness.

The fight today is not because we don’t want persecuted religious minorities to seek haven in India. That’s absurd. We are a very hospitable people.

We fight because 14 percent of Indians face religious persecution in their own country. We fight because the economy is going down and hatred is on the rise, and the ruling party has done nothing to fix either. Instead they are trying to alienate crores of Indians, making detention centres where at least [25 people have already died](https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/25-declared-foreigners-died-in-assam-detention-centre-750773.html) (as of 31 Jul ’19), and set the police and armed forces on peaceful protesters leading to the death of at least 20 people (as of 22 Dec ’19). Their fantasy project will cost us [lakhs of crores](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlTKGz-TvJk) (to pay for NRC, CAA and detention centres). And if 20 people have died in the 18 initial days of the protests, we may be looking at hundreds, or even thousands of deaths within the next year alone.

If you think what BJP is doing is for the good of the nation, then we disagree on the definition of ‘good’.

And we certainly disagree on the definition of a ‘nation’. Hindu Rashtra and Hindu nationalism violate the Constitution. And turning India into a theocracy like Iran is what Modi and Shah and the Sangh Parivar machinery wants to do. Can Modi say under oath that he does not want to convert India into Hindu Rashtra? Can the bhakts say so?

&#x200B;

**Fascism creates the conditions through which it can justify its own fascist policies.**

Religious conversion of India will require imposing tighter restrictions, and more fascist policies. And how does one justify the use of fascist policies?

An enemy.

While the protests have been going on, Indian and Pakistani firing across the border has increased (which was on the rise since the abrogation of 370). On [18 Dec](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/situation-along-loc-can-escalate-any-time-army-chief-bipin-rawat/articleshow/72872824.cms), Bipin Rawat issued a very provocative statement about “escalatory matrix”. On [19 Dec](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/12/letter-pakistan-india-placing-missiles-kashmir-191219101643065.html), the Pakistani Foreign Minister wrote to UN alleging India had positioned missile-launchers in Kashmir, and the Indian government refused to comment (*a* *great way to defuse tensions /s*). Then Imran Khan on [Dec 21](https://www.dawn.com/news/1523532/pakistan-will-give-befitting-response-if-india-undertakes-false-flag-operation-pm-imran) replied with such terms as “bloodbath” and “false flag operations”. And today ([22 Dec](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pakistan-violates-ceasefire-along-loc-in-jammu-and-kashmirs-rajouri-poonch/article30371876.ece)) morning there were major firing and shelling from both sides on multiple places: Pakistan [reports](https://thesouthern.com/news/world/pakistan-says-indian-shooting-kills-in-kashmir/article_e76017d4-78f9-5481-92c9-1a147f352159.html) three civilians killed with a dozen homes damaged, while India says our soldiers “retaliated effectively”.

Funnily enough, no talk of surgical strikes is floating around. Perhaps this time they do not serve Modi Ji’s purpose. Or perhaps there are no clouds in the sky? In any case, this time the purpose will perhaps be served by sacrificing our soldiers in a direct conflict. Against the Muslim-majority Pakistan.

And oh, the protesters who can be recognized by their clothes? Clearly they are Pakistani infiltrators and terrorists. The protesting students? *Tukde-tukde* gang. The professors, academicians and journalists? Anti-nationals and urban Naxals. International critics? They carry the ""white man's burden"" if they're white, and are inconsequential if they're of any other colour.

Fascism, elected democratically, will destroy democracy. Say your final “good morning” on WhatsApp.

In Nazi Germany, Jews were portrayed as dirty ‘rats’ (well, at least a mammal, not insects) who were lazy, stupid and cunning and stole the hard-working Germans’ jobs (see the contradictions?). In fact, Jews were on average well-educated and held important positions and ran businesses due to their hard work. Then through fascist policies, inch-by-inch, Nazis made the conditions unbearable for Jews, so that they really had to lose their jobs, their homes, had to live in squalor, and some started committing petty crimes to feed themselves. “See!” said the Nazis, “we told you they were cunning criminal rats!”

Thus they justified the Holocaust.

Justifying a holocaust is not that hard. We Indians are living that process of justification right now. Not so long ago, Islamophobia was frowned upon or at least hidden, and “anti-nationals” and “urban Naxals” were merely juvenile name-calling to be shrugged off (not so much for Gauri Lankesh). By creating the conditions, Modi is making these words into serious accusations, which will help him bring into effect more fascist policies, and then the Constitution will be re-written. The *ghar wapsi* of India will be complete.

We can at least make the process of justifying the holocaust hard for him. By calling out fake news, boycotting Modia, boycotting companies which support and finance BJP (you-know-who), and above all, by using non-violent means of protest. Y’know, protesting Indian-style.

*Ahimsa* is the word I believe."," I really really appreciate what you had to say. We are screwed on so many fronts that I honestly believe CAA js a good facade for the government to keep people engaged. Good news is that people are coming out in large numbers. 
The anti-muslim, anti-dalit anti-anything that isn't savarna Hindu (that too a very very specific type) policy is dangerous and the govt will unfortunately carry it out via the front or the back door.
I have also learnt a good lesson now- no party should get absolute power. The federal structure of government was designed by our founding fathers for a very sound reason. This is beautifully written. Can't disagree with any of it. Do you believe all of this will end in a remotely democratic manner? As in bjp's removal through elections? Or is it likely all bloodbath and genocide from here on culminating in civil wars and perhaps even foreign interference. As much as I agree with the spirit of this post, I completely disagree with the substance - or rather, your interpretation of India.

This isn't about _ghar wapsi_ or about Modi or, indeed, the BJP (scum though they are). This is about the creation of India as a political entity since before 1947. You see, it's this bit:

> And we certainly disagree on the definition of a ‘nation’. Hindu Rashtra and Hindu nationalism violate the Constitution. And turning India into a theocracy like Iran is what Modi and Shah and the Sangh Parivar machinery wants to do. Can Modi say under oath that he does not want to convert India into Hindu Rashtra? Can the bhakts say so?


The Constitution is only valid so long as the people of the country choose to hold it as valid. Pieces of paper have no power or sovereignty, they derive sovereignty from the people. The people have chosen to reject the constitution, because here's the kicker - the constitution and India are, and have always been, an inherently instable construct. The ideas of a secular India has always been deeply antithetical precisely because India is _not_ a nation by any rational definition of a nation. India is a hastily cobbled-together post-colonial creation that validates itself solely by creating an enemy - first the British Empire (justifiably so) and then Pakistan (unjustifiable) and Bangladesh (horrendously cruel).

It is these chickens that are, today, coming home to roost, because India's latent Hindutva was incredible easy to exploit. It always existed, it just lacked someone to point it out. And now that people are told that their Hindutva is threatened, the only justification they have always given themselves for the existence of their nation is collapsing, and they will shred the institutions meant to keep democracy safe just to keep their Hindu project safe.

India should never happened - the country was a post-colonial error, Britain's final kick to south Asia, and pretending it could ever be a secular country was a mistake. Secular nations are built on tangible cultures and cultural beliefs with concrete identities, like European nations, or Indian states. India was always Hindutva, and Hindutva was always India - all it lacked was the spark to set fire to the hatred and xenophobia that always existed, because that hatred is what justifies India's existence.

Tear the Republic down and demand statehood for your state, which is currently subjugated by India and Indianness. Sovereignty derives from a mandate of people living in consensus, and India will never have consensus that isn't phony and manufactured. That is the only way you can guarantee a better future for those not particularly religiously inclined. The idea of a Nation is based on commonality of language&culture. We preach ""Unity in Diversity"" and at the same time we also preach others to be ""Indian First"". These 2 messages are contradictory, why do we have to forgo our cultural identities to be an ""Indian"" if being Indian is just embracing the diversity?   Therein lies the ***real*** problem, the so called National Politics is stuck in a time capsule of North Centric Post-Partition Hindu-Muslim conflict. There is no nuance or logic to this narrative, BJP considers Hindu Nation as a foregone conclusion based on Partition whereas the other side doesn't have any retort other than ""let's not be a Hindu Pakistan"".

Liberals have lost the ideological battle because they're living in their own little worlds where they imagine India to be something its not. Majority of Indians don't give a damn about Progressive liberal beliefs and are drawn towards Charismatic leaders who talk in platitudes. What is the alternative to Modi? RAGA? Secularism is a noble State policy but it cannot be the only basis for a Nation. The ONLY ideological challenge Hindutva currently faces is Nativism from states such as Tamil Nadu&Bengal. Assamese opposition to CAB is also the same phenomenon, Assamese speakers have fallen below 50% in their own state and they don't want to fall any lower than that. 

>Forget Hindu texts, they don’t even have to study the Constitution

Liberals have spent the better part of 70+ years deconstructing and pointing out all the flaws of Hinduism but have done little to no attempt at highlighting the GOOD aspects of Hinduism to create a positive liberal Hindu identity. BJP has exploited this Hindu Identity vacuum by claiming that they understand&respect the good aspects of Hinduism,  people who would've sided with Liberals now side with BJP because they ""respect"" Hinduism, however superficial it may be. You should read [this article](https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/jyzFxtxjd2iGQPqA3mgOfN/Narendra-Modi-and-the-mystery-of-the-Hindu-Left.html) for more details. 

>Islamophobia

You're playing right into BJP's hands by using this term. BJP can&will use an UNO reverse card and label you as HinduPhobic.  **BottomLine:**You CANNOT defeat Hindu Identity politics by appealing to secularism&constitution ad nauseam.  You have to create a political Liberal Hindu identity in opposition to their bigoted one and market it to the masses. That is the only way i can see Hindutva going down. In summary:

1. BJP wants to change India into Hindu Rashtra
2. Muslims, Christians, Dalits and people who take the Constitution and secularism seriously will oppose that
3. Hence the BJP is hiding its intentions now; it has to change people's perceptions to normalize Hindutva even more than it is normalized currently
4. So how does it justify its fascism? By creating the conditions necessary for its justification
5. Muslims protesting in the streets will be portrayed as 'Pakistanis' or 'jihadis' who want India to become an Islamic state
6. Students will be seen as supporting Pakistan and jihadis, hence anti-nationals; they want to break India into pieces
7. Intellectuals are anti-nationals and urban Naxals, maybe even supporting China
8. Slurs such as these were merely slurs, not to be taken seriously, but now they'll become actual accusations (with perhaps legal, or extra-legal, consequences)
9. A conflict with Pakistan, or a very tangible fear of one, will help these slurs become real accusations
10. Thus BJP can justify further fascist policies like detention centres (which they deny now), and even unthinkable ones"
699,Policy/Economy,The problem with BJP supporters,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ed1ehe/the_problem_with_bjp_supporters/,"Okay, so this is my first ever post on reddit. I have been a keen observer of Indian politics since the last 6 years. I was a voter who voted for BJP in good faith thinking that they are different from other parties. But since the last few years my view point has completely changed. But this post won't discuss about the actions of BJP that led to the change in my political stance, but this would rather be a post about what is the real problem with the BJP supporters. 

I might be wrong here but here are some of my observations from my personal experience. 

1.) BJP fans simply don't understand that you can simultaneously oppose two political parties. As soon as you start debating them on a certain issue, they will straight away associate you with congress, communists or even with a terrorist. They believe that every one who is against BJP has joined a faction. 

2.) Staunch BJP fans certainly don't realize that a person isn't against the nation if they are against BJP.  They just rebrand you anti national even if you ask logical questions on government policies. These people are forgetting that we have every right to question the government and protest if we don't think something is right. That is what distinguishes us from a country like North Korea or Saudi Arabia. We do not have a king, rather we have a prime minister who is responsible for answering us. 

3.) BJP supporters tend to discredit each and every source which criticizes the government. These people are just not ready to accept the fact that someone who is not affiliated to any political party can criticize the government. If a post or a newspaper article condemns the government, they simply start calling it anti Indian or congress sponsored propaganda. 

4.) BJP supporters also use a tool called Whataboutism. They justify their wrongdoing by referring to the wrongdoing of other parties. For example, okay BJP is corrupt but what about congress it was more corrupt. But they do not understand that this does not change the fact that even BJP is corrupt, and if you are trying to bring positive changes you cannot repeat the same mistakes that your predecessors have made. 

5.) BJP supporters can't accept the fact that a person can do both constructive and destructive work. I agree that BJP has also brought in some positive changes, but that doesn't justify its wrongdoing. You can appreciate and criticize a person at the same time. Just because you have voted for them shouldn't make them immune to your criticism. You chose them to represent you, you have every right to criticize their actions and appreciate any good work. 

6.) Even if they can clearly see that BJP is playing communal politics, they will turn a blind eye to it. They say congress played a dirtier one, again whataboutism at its best. Congress played communal politics, that is the reason you voted against them. But if the new party also starts doing the same how can you support them only on the basis of your vote.  

7.) As soon as a communal card is played like mandir the BJP fans will always deviate from real issues like economy, poverty, economic reforms, business investments. Their first priority will become to resolve that petty issue rather than the real ones. 


So my thoughts on this issue is that in this day and age we are still fighting for the issues that the British wanted us to fight on. Religion, once upon a time it was used to unite people but right now it is only playing a divisive role. We as the modern generation have to stop taking pride in our religion and just not get emotional while voting on the basis of your religion. It does not matter whatever degree you have because if you caste your votes on the basis of just being from a particular religion then the value of getting that education goes to zero. Don't let social media dictate your perspective, do your own research and make your own mindset rather than following the mindset of the crowd. 

I would seriously like you guys to give your insight on this post. Thank you."," Every point is spot on! A physics prof from IIT Madras is my friend and we endlessly point out to him that anti bjp isn't pro congrss. I mean this is a guy who has learnt topology where a set that is not open need not be closed either. And still doesn't get this! They don't know what critical thinking is

Whatsapp University, Modia and IT Cell has brainwashed them BJP knows what racists Indians want to hear and spews that out over and over. that's why we call them Bhakts...for them opposing Bhand Janta Party is Blasphemy I agree with all these points. The saddest thing that has happened to me is I am no longer able to talk to my friends from highschool, we were friends since class 9th and since he supports Modi unconditionally he wouldn't even listen to me. So I hate this party and politics for this they have polarized us alot. The biggest problem I see is that they lie blatantly. It's so hard to have a good faith argument because they try to use every trick in the book except honesty. Very nicely said. Great job. 

By seeing all this text it is understood that you have done lot of debate and argument with people.

In a way u hv defended our great nation and tried to make it a better place. U defended it not at the border but from inside. So great job. I could agree more. I am so glad that people are starting to see the reality of things. 
Great job. Yea,and its absolutely right to call every bjp supporter (which far exceeds any other people) illiterate, bhakt and It cell if they support bjp and living yourself with pseudo superiority complex while thinking yourself as a 'intellectual' just because you don't support bjp, right?"
700,Policy/Economy,You. Yes!!! It's You. Do it.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ekjgwb/you_yes_its_you_do_it/,"It's high time already! It's so bad that a lurker has to post this. Have always been one, so as to never degrade the content quality of the sub. But, assessing the current political situation has made me impromptu promptly write this.
I'm not here to be a keyboard warrior by bashing the fascist leader and gain karma out of it.
Instead, I'll lay down a plan to tackle the current regime. It only deals with their propaganda power since it has time and again proven that propaganda plays a major role in convincing people to support or commit atrocities. This is the pillar that provides support to the oncoming fascism. Let's BREAK them into pieces. 

1) Since, lack of karma has refrained me from writing things in other subs. As a sound citizen, we need you to get our situation to be heard globally (like the HongKong protest). Henceforth, Fella redditors with high karma and eloquent writing skills. Do post articles, videos, engage in group discussions happening in global subs like world news, Politics and many more. Subs that has their presence in the front page.
Use your meme knowledge, post and repost memes to subs like memes, dank meme, meme economy and so on.

2) WhatsApp is the breeding ground for BJP propaganda. Inorder to counter this, we need you to post videos highlighting the hypocrisy of this party. Especially the ones that OFFICIAL PEEING HUMAN uploads. Tweet him asking for an offline download link of his vidoes. Or do download it by illegal means ( anything illegal for greater good is good).
Do not post link to the videos. Mid-life crisis unkills and aunties won't open the link and watch it. Even if they did, not gonna watch more than 5 seconds. They are brainwashed in thinking Modi is the superman that's gonna save their arse from monotonous life. Do not send them to a liberal's den. They identify themselves as Bhakt due to the sheer propaganda and will refute to believe any of it. Hence, remove the doctrine slowly. Administer the truth little by little in their silly heads. Truth is, if they can be brainwashed to an extend that can support this regime without giving any batshit about the trend of the country. They can be rewired to think in the right way as well. Sharing offline videos in WhatsApp groups will definitely make them watch it accidentally atleat once. Since, they are prone to clicking it on their Phone Gallery.  Apparently,most of them don't care to even delete it later.

You will obviously face criticism from your family, friends and acquaintances by sharing the videos in their WhatsApp Group. Calm your nerves down. Do not engage in a rebuttal with them. Keep posting every hour every day. Things will change. People who blindly supported the party's claims will progressively begin to think about it. They may not change their stand an overnight, a week, a month or forever. But will definitely cross think about the situation. And will not start shouting slogans praising this fascist regime.
Do add photos and videos highlighting great leaders,celebrities,experts of any field expressing their opinions. Do quote Golden words said by past leaders and dictators regarding the fascism.
Share pictures of scientific data and statistics highlighting the economic growth, unemployment     trend and so on. 

Might seem like a silly thing to do. But things like these are definitely the ones that pulled them in supporting BJP in the first place.

3) Eloquent writers of this sub. Please Write messages that serves like a WhatsApp forward messages. (You know, like the share with five groups to charge your smartphone to 100%)
Mods, please make an active thread on it. Allow us to copy and share it in the other online medias.
Use your wit and style, to enhance the power of the message. 

DO NOT LABEL an ignorant or a brainwashed mind as a bhakt or sanghi. I trusted Modi by the party's propaganda thinking they did good for the nation. Unlike the mainstream propaganda, I fell prey to the pretentious Quoran who bags the number one place in followers count. He sold lies without telling lies. He never lied about the policy and regulations government made. Instead, he bent and twisted the facts in favour of the party. He sold hopes after every failure of the government's action. He's a prime example of an educated moron. He highlights the fact that an educated mind is not equivalent as an intellect's mind.
Sorry it turned into a rant.
Wanted y'all to know,how a budding mind like mine fell to his black magic. His educational credentials is what makes growing and educated minds fall for such propaganda trap. If I hadn't stumbled upon this platform, I would've remained a Bhakth even now. 

Change starts from your home. Don't involve in a verbal abuse or quarrel with your hardcore right wing conservative family,if they are one. Instead, keep mumbling about the country's situation then and now like a casual talk.
Let their mind process it.
Educate them about history like How Hitler rose to power and how our country is trying to be the 1930's Germany.

Unlike the Nazi's  who had control over the media back then i.e the newspapers and Radio which was and is only one-sided where the true mind couldn't express the truth. Our generation is blessed enough to have countless online presence and mode of communication is much easier and two sided.

Brainwash the minds into thinking right.

Do not outcast them into a different sect. This will only create chaos. Their sadness will be disguised in the form anger. This will make them loathe our ideologies and ultimately send them into the deep pit of what propaganda machines dug.

Rather,listen to their side and make them understand. I don't know how many of the downvoted answers/ comments were genuinely by people who just needed to hear the other side of the story aka the true and filtered one.
If they are hell bent on being a bhakth,just ignore them. 

You know,brain is a fragile thing. It's shaped by the things that it's surround itself with.

4) Post Documentaries, articles, paragraphs from well renowned books about our world history or anything that seems relevant to the current cause

Fellow redditors be ready to smash the upvote buttons in sending them to the front page. 

It's far-off better than highlighting tweets or images that creates only segregation in the society.

Let's walk the path of Ahimsa and Truth.

""In a gentle way, you can shake the world.""
""Whenever you are confronted with an opponent, conquer him with love.""- M.K Gandhiji

""Peace  cannot be built on exclusivism, absolutism, and intolerance. But neither can it be built on vague liberal slogans and pious programs gestated in the smoke of confabulation. There can be no peace on earth without the kind of inner change that brings man back to his 'right mind'.""



LET'S DO IT. LET'S EDUCATE THEM."," https://splinternews.com/we-asked-a-cult-deprogramming-expert-how-to-talk-your-f-1793857315 There is a certain group that will be beyond any understanding. Religion/Caste/Class are so ingrained deeply into Indian society that its incredibly difficult to escape from it. The only solution is to educate the kids properly so that they don’t take this horseshit over. Unfortunately in a tight family unit society its very difficult to do that. Please post memes about this on subreddits like r/memes or r/dankmemes so as to raise international awareness, like Hong Kong protesters. I agree with OP.

We must all do our part in this, no matter how small!"
701,Policy/Economy,"Hello Top Minds of R/india, Is the Indian economy being nokia-ed?",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cz0ctb/hello_top_minds_of_rindia_is_the_indian_economy/,"I am uncomfortable with the narrative that the bureaucrats and figureheads in the Indian government are clueless morons tanking our economy. Why can't it be the same thing Microsoft did to Nokia? Force a fire sale of Indian government assets. Maybe we are up for the biggest wealth transfer to the richest elite in this country since demonetization? Or am i wearing my tin foil hat a little too tight?

Edit: Spelling"," One of the biggest reasons for this slowdown is the death of private consumption. It was the only wheel that was sustaining the economy. Now with rural consumption taking a hit, the government is clueless. To revive demand it needs to pump that RBI surplus as development expenditure, but it risks increasing the inflation. With lower income rates and if inflation rises the government is on for a disaster.
Long story short, the government is walking on fire. Why not both? Their cluelessness contributed to the current slowdown, but they are also corrupt enough to use this opportunity to transfer Air India etc to Adani et al for cheap.

Also privatization does not have to be the government's brain child. It could simply be the government's friends seeing an opportunity and them 'convincing' the government. > Force a fire sale of Indian government assets.

This is a good rationale actually. Keep the tinfoil hat, we'll see more patterns like this. I am more interested in knowing what microsoft did to Nokia? It will happen. There are a lot of PSUs that the govt wants to rid of, but who will buy it when the buyers themselves are in a slump? 1) Global recession was long forecasted for 2020 
2) We failed to capitalise opportunity to get business from China 
3) Indian economy rested on what we call ""black money"" , addition of cluster mess which we call gst further compounded it, lack of government trust, and dynamic policies and if that was not enough the accumulation of money from middle class to elite few who won't invest leads to the perfect concoction to kick down our economy. Don't forget recession is part of economy cycle. 

Probable future :We should expect deflation of economy which will lead to lower product costs but also more job losses. 

Possible but unlikely: Govt may decrease interest rate in favor of inflation, now do remember most people use interest as investment option and they may get fked , but I don't see it increasing borrowings. New minted currencies + deflation + lower currency exchange value against usd may lead us down to Zimbabwe root Inviting the top minds of r/India? 246000 replies coming up Damn right!

We were once the 3310 of world economy...sigh! In a free economy, people have choice to use either cash or electronic/ banking medium. Cash has its own positives and cons. Once printed, it goes through thousands of extra transactions with no extra significant cost. However, the electronic transactions charge per transaction. Both the system should compete, and people can choose. Cash shouldn’t be a dirty word. It's hard to predict as this recession seems to be a cyclic one, it's not just India but globally the investment is slowing. There are many factors that can be attributed to current downturn and for every industry there's a different reason. What I believe is that India in actuality never recovered well from 2008, while in fiscal terms we were out of recession very quickly this was in parts fuelled by the excessive lending during 2009-12 from various public/private sector banks.

Till 2013 coupled with High Crude oil prices economy loomed, around 2014 crude oil prices decreased but the effects of NPA's started kicking in economy. During the same time many big loans started converted to NPA's and the every single month the NPA's ballooned. 

In between the Central Government's implementation of GST and Demonetisation fractured a lot of domestic consumption, as a lot of it depended on Black money ( This is my personal opinion ).  The current government failed to control the NPA's till Q1 FY’19 when there was reduction of stocks of NPA's  by \~Rs.21,000 Cr. 

The government now has started to refinance these banks and merge them, although merging shouldn't have been a priority, while it wasn't a bad step per say. The surplus that Government skimmed from RBI a part of it might be used for PSB Recapitalisation which seems to be a good step, again it's hard to predict anything when it comes to economy its a dynamic system of scale that no one can comprehend.

Rich will always get richer, there's no problem in that. I believe the important issue is for the countries large population ( India )  is to deliver jobs and grow middle class. With a lot of manufacturing automation / automation it would be hard to grow a middle class ( again this is an assumption ) . At this stage it's very difficult to predict to what extent automation is going to affect the job market. 

Now coming to selling assets , may be or may be not. There's no singular answer. 

I think governments montenisation plans on non-core assets is fine, if some business / riches can get even more rich through clever understanding of Indian bureaucracy it's still not a bad deal , not atleast for an average tax paying Indian middle class citizen,  we won't have to shell out money for operations of various CPSEs that are a burden on our pockets. The biggest concern is how this government has a socialistic attitude for the poor and a capitalistic outtake for ultra-rich. There is a very little concern for middle class, anyhow this is nothing new. 

We need to stop relying on Central / State governments, as for our business rather than expecting government to provide incentive for domestic business ( like China does ) , a lot of our business have to grow Global ambitions rather than fixating ourselves on Indian domestic market. I don't think the toxic mix of bureaucrats who are selected through UPSC with questionable hiring process and Politicians will be mature enough to understand the dynamic global market. While it's an extremely painstaking process but I do see a lot of business growing in core engineering services in India ( from mobile transceivers, SDR to Custom ASIC's ) who are actually making a lot of money. Leaving aside fancy AI / ML ( essentially decorated statisticians ).   
There are huge opportunities in global markets, only if we have vision and risk taking aptitude. Our economy is not just and shouldn't solely depend on a immature Government structure.

703,Policy/Economy,Hear me out. This might be a rant. Maybe this government doesn't care about the people at all. Maybe we deserve this government as we did not vote them out in the last elections. Maybe this would be a lesson to future voters on whom not to vote.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ekxrig/hear_me_out_this_might_be_a_rant_maybe_this/,"The way the leaders of this government are behaving, it is quite clear they have their heads buried so up in their own asses, they are totally oblivious of the ground realities. By the time people were yet to come out of Article 370 removal and Babri Masjid verdict, the government went ahead and implemented CAA. These guys are so good at creating new fires even before the embers of old flames have died down. They are not even giving time to the civil society to catch a breath.

Seriously attacking students and then condemning the attacks for namesake as if people wouldn't know who was behind these cowardly attacks. They have literally come to a conclusion that public is stupid, they will believe whatever our we spin it in the media. Gautam gambhir could have visited the university, hell nirmala sitharam is an Alumni of the same University. Is anyone even ready to take moral responsibility for these attacks?

I am pretty sure the party in power is almost ready to unleash their next half baked policy on our people and we will have to start protesting against that. Damn these are going to be 4 more very long years. By then the economy will be gone to dogs and if anybody questions anything there will always be the Pakistan rhetoric."," Internet activism doesn't translate to real world.

We must discuss and reason with the people around us. I can't imagine what next 4 years have in store for us I noticed something odd during election times. Before the elections most of the popular porn sites were banned and only VPN accessible. Just right before are around that solider got released from Pakistan, all those popular porn sites were back to normal. No ban. Nothing. We have already accepted it was our mistake that we are in this position. We thought that the collective consciousness will trump all the bad and the evil mindset and take us forward. This can only go wrong if the collective believes religion is the way forward. Currently the protests are the form of the first draft answer to this long brewing fascism. And yes, if bjp rose to power, congress laid out the dais for its birth. We have to accept this fact, without acceptance we are not going to move forward. We need better alternatives. In this government, development comes with a cost(mostly secularism). Congress is shit. It's the best time for the rise of a new party and it is absolutely possible(eg AAP). Politicians should try to educated the people rather than trying to get people to act on emotion. No one can beat the bjp in using emotions to win elections, which is what all the parties are trying to do these days."
704,Policy/Economy,Moderate rightists vs extremist Savarkarites,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ecr1tb/moderate_rightists_vs_extremist_savarkarites/,"I'd identify myself as a centrist with a left inclination. I swing both directions on economic and social issues, but am strongly liberal and progressive on civil liberties. If someone labels me leftist, i would say - not entirely true, but sometimes I'm pretty leftist. With being labeled socialist, I would disagree more assertively, citing my strong inclinations towards a healthy mixed economy and market driven solutions to socio-economic problems. But if I was to be labeled Communist or Naxalite, I would vehemently disagree. I'm sure there are some overlaps between these ideologies and mine, but that way I'll have some overlaps with almost all ideologies in the world. So there's a spectrum on the left side of politics, which is well understood widely. Like me, most leftists don't identify with being communist or naxalite.

Now, right of centre politics, which is having a bit of a peak moment globally at the moment, is bound to have similar diversity and differentiation. But this differentiation is not as well understood, perhaps because Indian right has not been as dominant historically as it has been lately, so people haven't caught up yet. In case of the Modi-Shah government, a lot of people voted for them in the 2014 general elections because of the anti-corruption and development narrative they campaigned with, and because of the national security issue which peaked following Pulwama attack and Balakot airstrikes. These people may be supporters of market-driven economic reforms, may want a break from the status quo of structural corruption in the Indian state, may aspire towards a more assertive foreign policy and may desire a more proactive law and order regime. These are issues which many pragmatic liberals and leftists would also support. I, myself support many of this government's foreign, security and environmental policies. Can't say the same for this government's economic policies and civil liberties record. Anyone who doesn't see the plight of the Indian economy is delusional.

Coming back to the topic, most of the BJP voters may not support the RSS agenda or consider Modi an avatar of Vishnu. But nonetheless, in the everyday online discourse, anyone supporting Modi or government's policy is labeled as Modi-cultist (b word) or belonging to RSS (s word). These terms have been misused so much that they have become meaningless. (But at least  they are not as obscene as the terms that the right uses against left) This distinction between moderates and extremists on the right needs to be acknowledged and understood. The extremists on the Indian right subscribe to the Savarkarite ideology of radical majoritarian nationalism, which they try to link with Hinduism, by calling it Hindutva. The extremist Savarkarites are the ones who indulge in conspiracy theories of global islamic takeover, and that 'sab mile hue hain' - students, congress, aap, muslims, bollywood, global media (even Pak and Dawood). They act as if questioning our own government in a democracy is a crime. These Savarkarites are violently anti-Gandhian, so they are ready to justify any means, as long as the ends are as per their ideology. They are ok with democratic institutions being destroyed so that their leader wins,  hundreds dying because of demonetisation, regular Kashmiris suffering because of some extremist elements, innocent students being shot at because of vandalism done by others, and so on.

This extremist faction of the right is the real danger to our nation, and to whom most liberal leftists are strongly opposed. These Savarkarites interpret the BJP manadate to mean that majority of the country supports their extremists views of establishment of Hindu Rashtra, demonization of Muslims and one-party state in India. They forget that 65 % of Indians didn't vote for BJP, and even among the 35% that did,  many don't support their extremist agenda. These spontaneous, peaceful protests by lakhs of students in every single part of the country has proven that these Savarkarites are delusional. India is strongly pluralistic and will vehemently oppose the bigoted agenda that they subscribe to. And these lakhs of protestors are more opposed to violence than these extremist Savarkarites, and are heart-broken when some miscreants turn towards violence. Violent and extremist elements on both sides should be punished by the due process of law. Jai Hind!

P.S: Those who see the world only through one lens will wonder if I'm a muslim. I was born a Hindu, but no longer identify with any religion. I'm a proud Indian though."," Someone give this man a silver right fucking now! You're just clumping all right wing ideology together and calling these people ""Sarvarkarites"", which is misleading at best.

If you read Savarkar's writings, he never conflated Hinduism with Hindutva as you are trying to imply. Savarkar was actually pretty clear that religion had nothing to do with Hindutva. What he described as hindutva was a 'homogenous cultural identity of the subcontinent' according to him, which excluded the practices and traditions of Abrahamic religions because he believed those were foreign influences.

This is significantly different than the RSS, which is a primarily Brahmin Hindu organisation which believes in intra Hindu fragmentation as well, in other words, they do believe in castiest principles.

Things that you see nowadays such as all the Cow worship and beef ban, etc would not be a thing if people were following Savarkar.

Yes, both of these are far right ideological positions and I personally do not agree with any of them and think they are harmful to the country.

But **when you are talking about the ideological spectrum as you are in this post, you should recognise that the RSS ideology lies even further right to that of Savarkar.** Just take 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽 Why don't you identify yourself with any religion now? The first paragraph is exactly how I'd describe myself too. Absolutely nailed it!"
705,Policy/Economy,I transcribed the full text of Dr. Manmohan Singh's remarks on economic mismanagement by the current government in India,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/czvagp/i_transcribed_the_full_text_of_dr_manmohan_singhs/,"*Transcript of the remarks by India’s former Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, about economic mismanagement under the Modi government. Sept 1 2019.*

The state of the economy today is deeply worrying. The last quarter’s GDP growth rate of 5 percent signals that we are in the midst of a prolonged slowdown. India has the potential to grow at a much faster rate, but all-round mismanagement by the Modi government has resulted in this slowdown.

It is particularly distressing that the manufacturing sector’s growth is tottering at 0.6 percent. This makes it very clear that our economy has not yet recovered from the man-made blunders of demonetisation and a hastily implemented GST. Domestic demand is depressed. And consumption growth is at an 18 month low. Nominal GDP growth is at 15 year low.

There is a gaping hole in tax revenues. Tax buoyancy remains elusive as businessmen, small and big, are hounded, and tax terrorism continues unabated. Investor sentiment are in doldrums. These are not the foundations for economic recovery.

The Modi government’s policies are resulted in massive jobless growth. More than 3.5 lakh Jobs have been lost in the automobile sector alone. There will similarly be large scale job losses in the informal sector, hurting our most vulnerable workers.

Rural India is in terrible shape. Our farmers are not receiving adequate prices and rural incomes have declined. The low inflation rate that the Modi government likes to showcase comes at the cost of our farmers and their income, by inflicting misery on over 50 percent of India’s population.

Institutions are under attack, and their autonomy is being eroded. The resilience of the Reserve Bank will be tested after its record transfer of rupees 1.76 lakh crore to the government, which claims that it does not have a plan on what it will do with this windfall. In addition, the credibility of India’s data has come under question under this government.

Budget announcements and rollbacks have shaken the confidence of international investors. India has not been able to increase the exports to take advantage of opportunities that have arisen in global trade due to geopolitical realignment. Such is the state of economic management under the Modi government.

Our youth, our farmers and our farm workers, entrepreneurs, and the marginalised section deserve better. India cannot afford to continue down this path. Therefore, I urge the Government to put aside vendetta politics and reach out to all sane voices and thinking minds to steer our economy out of this man-made crisis."," What's particularly angering to me is that the BJP listened to all this and then came out and made a completely unrelated and irrelevant attack on Dr. MMS by calling him a puppet of the Congress leadership.

Whether or not he was, I fail to understand how that is connected to the statement Dr. MMS had made on the economy.

And then they went ahead and said that the economy is working fine under the Modi government. I mean like wtf? Then why did the RBI transfer an unprecedented 1.76 lakh crore to the government? Why did the Fin Min rollback some of the budgetary provisions to implement new ones? Why is your NITI Aayog leadership and the economic advisors to the PM affirming that there indeed is a slowdown? Why are core sectors performing pathetically? Why are factories closing up?

Matlab, chutiya samaj rakha hai bas. Literally lying to our faces. At least acknowledge that there is a problem! Solving it comes later in the process. [deleted] > Rural India is in terrible shape. Our farmers are not receiving adequate prices and rural incomes have declined. The low inflation rate that the Modi government likes to showcase comes at the cost of our farmers and their income, by inflicting misery on over 50 percent of India’s population.

To me, this is the single biggest blunder The DeMo was big but one time blunder. Whereas, ignoring the farm crisis year on year is an even bigger blunder. You cannot say we have managed inflation by putting more than 50% of the population in severe debt and income crisis. That's not how you manage inflation. And that's exactly why this BJP govt has got the basics of economics wrong. And even now, I am afraid that all the subsidies are going to go to industries. Sure you can artificially increase the production and trade through govt intervention. But only for a limited period of time. Because who would consume what is produced when 50% of the population have had very poor income and are in debt. I really really hope that govt invests into the rural market. That is the need of the hour. But are they listening? MMS uses long sentences and uses big words like  tax buoyancy & elusive, he needs to put out statement in ELI5 format for folks in BJP to understand. If you need this as screenshots, 3 images here:  [https://imgur.com/a/l1YWSch](https://imgur.com/a/l1YWSch)

(if you need a non-Reddit link of the text, check my profile)

Useful to share when someone says ""oh it's cyclical, the global economy is slowing down"", etc.

MMS says it's a man-made disaster and I agree... maybe the UPA wasn't perfect and benefited from lucky market cycles (like the pre-2010 real estate boom), but all we've had since 2014 is pointless marketing campaigns with no follow-through like 'Make in india', 'startup india', etc, then self-inflicted wounds like Demonetisation, hastily-implemented GST, and all sorts of random regulations and taxes, including extreme margins for the govt on fuel (and businesspeople reporting increased harassment.) This is a misery. However, I salute Modi Govt. to have steered Indians and kept them away from realising these problems by giving them some other bullshit motives to praise him... like a Hindu rashtra and ordering some airstrike. He totally distracted people and still has them distracted from growing problems of unemployment..which was already the most serious problem during his 1st term.

You have to admit, NaMo is an expert at marketing himself and still keeping himself in power using things against the people of India which they like the most. Even among these problems of lack of employment, the people of India too (maybe not those who come here on Reddit, but still a lot of them) prefer  achieving a hindu rashtra rather than bringing something home to feed their families. It's not just NaMo, it's also the people of India. NaMo is just using this gullible nature to his advantage. 

And his propoganda...ooh la la...mamma mia....xD...all this fooling around with Rahul Gandhi being an idiot..well...to be fair...both leaders have said terribly stupid things in the past...but nobody ridicules the NaMo but pounces on RaGa instantaneously. Like seriously..you think we don't notice that there is no connection in totally ripping apart RaGa's political image apart and nobody touching you. Wow! 

This brings me to that airstrike...there was some terrorist activity and whatever action was needed to be taken was taken. Would've been done regardless of who was in power. And anyway, the suggestion to conduct an airstrike would've been suggested by the Head of the IAF, CAS; PMO just gives a GO to any suggestion. It was obviously beneficial to him looking how overtly patriotic our idiotic citizens were becoming. Another cheap thrill Indians love: Insulting Pakistan in whatever way possible. As a result...Indians loved this activity and there goes NaMo again.

And as a matter of fact...he steers the crowd so well, that these very people who had a twinkle in their eyes at the thought of 'acche din' have forgotten that those 'acche din' never arrived. So fucking awesome that a leader can do this. Last I knew somebody being this influential was Adolf Hitler and this is not insulting Modi. Maybe Forbes also named him one of the top most influential leaders of the world....but they don't know what kind of influence. 

You should try triggering people sentimentally by saying something mildly anti Modi on a primitive social platform like Facebook or Whatsapp...(some platform where a majority of this hindu-rashtra loving population is). The kind of blind love for NaMo and the immediate labelling of anti-national, endless hate, life threats, rape threats and whatnot: This is where you see the true India..the India that voted BJP in power.

In such a scenario, where the government and the citizens focus more on religion than actual livelihood of themselves, the people who want a better life are just stuck here. Best solution according to me is to escape this country ASAP and settle at place where your livelihood is not affected and you're away from religious wars and petty politics. Places like this exist, trust me. You just cannot thrive in India and cultivate a good ambitious career here. 

Maybe there will come a time where India will plunge so deep down this shithole that it'll have to press a hard reset over everything and start afresh. Maybe some day then it'll have a better and educated leader who'll actually take the reigns of this actually glorious country and restore it. Maybe maybe maybe. But this plunging and this reset is far from near....not happening 1-2  generations away from me since the current and all future contingents for this leadership are fucked up people. It'll take some more years to bring this country down just by virtue of it's volume. Since it is so slow, nobody is noticing... that's it.

This may be sounding a bit anti-nationalistic but I really think this is where the country is leading and there's no way leaders are mending their ways in the near future to steer away from this mess...they only know how to steer away from reality. Am I the only one who read it in his voice? He has ignored the fact that Hindu khatre me hai /s Legend When the country's majority is high AF on their drug of choice aka 'Hindutva', such important words of wisdom mean nothing. 

Farmers may be distressed now. The middle class may be bearing the brunt of Modinomics now. SMEs may be feeling the pinch now. 

But come elections, a military op against Pakistan or a perfectly timed resurgence of the Ram Mandir issue in the media or something equally manipulative would immediately turn these same now badly off, economically screwed dildos into loyal bhakts and they'll end up voting for the very same government which annihilated their happiness. *Again*. 

That's how powerful this drug is. Equally destructive is the epidemic caused by it. 

This drug, and those selling it, need to go for this self-inflicted fog of disorientation, chaos and self-destruction to lift. Actually, couldn’t agree more. Clearly the government is doing something wrong and it has to revisit its policies without appearing indecisive. and why have they increased the road penalties so much? Single biggest mistake of Indians was to elect NARENDRA modi as Prime Minister. As much as I like Dr. Manmohan Singh, it was criminal of UPA II to not impose GST under his watchful eyes. BJP and economics. Well, then why did they give Amartya Sen a Nobel prize for that? Any folks here in Economics and Finance care to elucidate on the situation - both for BJP and what our former PM is saying? O bhai! Yeh saari chize toh sanjay rajoura bhi bata deta. Koi solution bhi toh sunao manmohan sahib. There will be recession every 10 years because of business cycle. Govt cannot do anything. It is actually harmful to interfere. Nothing but opportunistic statement from Manmohan. It’s ok just blame us Chinese, we can take the extra hate.

Jokes aside at least u guys don’t see 50% rise in food prices [removed] I bet none of the numb nuts in the govt can explain the terms Tax Buoyancy, Jobless Growth and Nominal GDP. I agree with everything he says here. But without taking sides or calling names, interviews like this have lacked something people like me want to actually see; a solution. Of course, the economy is in doldrums, but Dr. Singh needs to shed some light on what this Govt. *can* do to improve this state of affairs. Politics in our country has always been about pointing out where either of the two parties has f\*cked up, with none coming out of any discussion the wiser. I know there are irreconcilable differences between not just the party ideologies but also within the voter camps, but the economy, like a million other issues, plague our citizens irrespective of their political beliefs. Desh ko bacha lo Sardar Ji we are fucked Okay we know what the problem is, what should be done now? Not like the general elections are around the corner. It'd be really great if people like MMS would help with the solutions and help the nation from this economic catastropy despite being from the opposition party. Thank you so much. I'm writing a thesis and using this speech, so you saved me tons of time! Vice chairman of NITI aayog on economic slowdown:. 

>stress in the financial sector has led to a slowdown in the economy, the Niti Aayog vice-chairman said the entire episode started with indiscriminate lending during 2009-14 leading rise in non-performing assets (NPAs) post 2014.
Rising NPAs reduced the ability of banks to do fresh lending, he said, adding the space was occupied by the shadow banks with credit growth of 25%.
The non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) could not manage this high loan growth leading to defaults by some of the large entities triggering slowdown in the economy eventually.  

Source: https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/niti-aayog-for-extraordinary-steps-to-deal-with-economic-slowdown/article29221514.ece/amp/ 

>It is particularly distressing that the manufacturing sector’s growth is tottering at 0.6 percent.  

This too could have been caused because banks had to stay back from credit expansion due to prolonged NPA problem. What do you think India will become in ten years - a kleptocracy like Russia or authoritarian state like Turkey? I thought if the the massive social subsidies under the NDA government continued we would have turned like Brazil. In a way then, it is good that BJP continues to be in power. They will reap the evils of what they sowed in the last tenure Agree with the points discussed here. Lekin sabne vote to BJP Ko he Dia? Kyun Dia? If not BJP then who else? Kaun banega PM ?

706,Policy/Economy,Blind boomer analogy in India - We are the real boomers,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/elxn3v/blind_boomer_analogy_in_india_we_are_the_real/,"With the ""OK Boomer"" memes becoming popular, I've noticed a lot of Indians blindly picking up American boomer arguments and using it in Indian context. The arguments go something to the tune of - you had the best of times, the best jobs, social security, economic growth and are now becoming an impediment to education subsidies and liberal policies that will benefit the present youth.

In the Indian context, these arguments are only partially true. Firstly, the word boomer refers to baby boomers generation born post WW-II (1946-1964). This was the period where the great health-care became accessible to everyone in developed nations and the child mortality dropped fast. However, the birth-rates remained relatively high (though decreasing) and this led to high number of kids being born. This was the golden period of American growth - women and boomers then joined labor force and there was a great productivity rise in labor. Middle-class grew and moved to sub-urbs and could live that idylic existence with benefits of big cities as well as countryside. Boomers led a positive existence - not just that, because the birth-rates decreased subsequently, boomers also had disproportionate power as a voting block (which was bolstered by the fact that the voting % in boomers is much higher than in subsequent generations too). So, they could bring about and keep laws which were in line with their values but were old-fashioned according to their successors. Moreover, older people living on savings hate increase in inflation that comes with debt-fueled government spendings. So, it was natural for this generation to be debt hawks which also meant opposition to subsidies which led to rise in education debt amongst younger generation.Hence, it is a legitimate cause of angst for politically savvy young people who are forced to live in a society controlled by the oldies who support arcane laws (against abortion for instance) and go against their benefits (education subsidies).

However, India has a completely different demographic profile. Purely, in terms of being the largest generation, we are the boomers of India. We were born around or just before the high growth post-liberalization India, have opportunities (in terms of private sector jobs, access to information) that the older generation did not have (boomers had booming economy whereas their parents had depression and war). Even as a political block, the young people have the biggest electoral power amongst all generations (a power that was partially harnessed by BJP when they won two elections). Moreover, with the dropping birth-rates in India, we would also grow old in an era of depressed population growth where we continue to be the most influential generation - just like the boomers!

However, it is also true that the older generation is more bigoted, religiously/caste-wise minded than us and have a role in morally bankrupt polity in this country. There is some blame that we can certainly lay on the older generation. But, the whole boomer spiel of the west wherein the millennial generation claims that the boomers had a much better life and are now actively spoiling the present and future of current youth is certainly not applicable here. Our parents' generation had a life of scarcity in terms of resources and opportunities. Even if you are not interested in reading history or talking to your parents, just watch movies - heroes or characters who were struggling to find work, were getting rejected because they could not pay bribes were part of every story. Apart from government jobs, any city apart from tier-I had little to no opportunities in the license-raj era. Statistically, there was lower economic growth and more poverty.

To see the claims about the older generation led a great life is ridiculous. However, it is true that the young need to break free of the religious and caste fundamentalism that the older generation were a victim of due to their lack of exposure and programming."," So I can say 'OK Boomer' to my casteist uncle? [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Vkz8Y\_9vU4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Vkz8Y_9vU4)

Had to do it. Look at the price of a home in the current market and look at it 30 years ago. Look at the price of an education today and look at it 30 years ago. 


Its quite similar to the situation in America."
707,Policy/Economy,The govt takes 1.75 lakh crore from the RBI and proceeds to give 1.45 lakh crore to large corporates.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d6xedi/the_govt_takes_175_lakh_crore_from_the_rbi_and/,"What bizzaro world are we in where this is something to be celebrated.

Do people not understand that the majority of these ""funds"" will be spent on stock buybacks and higher bonuses? There are clear and abundant examples of what happens around the world when corp tax rates are decreased without a simultaneous effort to tackle the underlying problems of a stuttering economy.

Basic economic policy will tell you that in economies with deman side issues, an income tax cut will have far better and far more extensive implications that a corp tax cut.

fucking idiots the bunch of them. And all you morons that celebrate this."," **The ELI5 version for those who didn't understand OP**:

- Taxes are how government get the money to run itself. 
- When taxes are reduced, government revenue falls. 
- Modi *kaka* has reduced the taxes for his corporate buddies.
- The resulting [tax reduction (of around 27%)](https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/national/corporate-tax-cuts-a-panic-reaction-to-tide-over-choppy-sensex-congress) means government will lose around 1.45 lakh crore in tax revenue.
- Now, remember that the government had forced RBI to give it 1.75 lakh crore to ""boost"" the economy""? 
- So effectively, government tax cut will cause a loss of 1.45 lakh crore, and RBI money will be used to make up for it.
- In effect, Modi *kaka* is using our money so that corporates can get richer and share their wealth with him so that he can continue to dress in style (through 15+ lakh suit boot ~~bribes~~ gifts) and ensure BJP remains the richest political party in India.

**OP's Analysis**:

- OP points out that businesses will just use the money from tax cut to shore up themselves (by buying their own stocks or giving bigger bonuses).
- OP points that the real problem currently is that people are not buying anything.
- Less demands mean business have to reduce production as people are buying less.
- Reducing production means some workers have less or no work to do.
- So businesses will reduce the work force.
- Some businesses will reduce salary of workforce.
- Net effect, there will be less and less money to buy things.
- Reduced demands means more business loss and job cuts.
- OP suggests an income tax rate cut would help with this.
- If people have more money in hand, they will invest and spend more.
- An income tax rate cut is one way to ensure salaried people have more money.

> The centre of the government’s policy in dealing with the economic slowdown has been to offer sops to the supply side when nearly every economist is convinced that the problem stems from low demand *Source*: [Nirmala Sitharaman ignores the recipe to get out of the mess suggested by Manmohan Singh](https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/opinion/nirmala-sitharaman-ignores-the-recipe-to-get-out-of-the-mess-suggested-by-manmohan-singh)

**ELI5 of ""trickle down economy"" concept** under which this big tax cut for corporate is defended:

- The ""trickle down"" economic ""theory"" claims that benefits to the wealthy trickle down to everyone else.
- These benefits are usually tax cuts on businesses, high-income earners, capital gains, and dividends.
- The theory says that only rich people can drive economic growth.
- So it proposes tax cuts only for the wealthy, and not a general tax cut for everyone.
- It also proposes that the cuts have to be big for it to work (based on [Laffer Curve](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/laffercurve.asp) theory).
- It promises that the wealthy will use the extra money from the tax cuts to invest more, and expand business.
- This in turn will create more jobs or better jobs (higher salary).
- Thus, new jobs or higher salary mean people will spend more money and thus boost the economy. 
- This was applied by Reagan and Bush in the USA.
- During both the Reagan and Bush era, the economy improved.
- But Reagan had also increased government spending.
- Bush had also lowered Federal Fund rates (so loans became cheaper).
- So critics do not accept that the ""trickle down"" tax cut theory helped the economy. 
- They point out that during both Reagan and Bush era, inequality between the wealthy and the poor increased.
- The top one-fifth of the rich increased their income by 80%!
- The top 1 percent tripled their income!
- So instead of trickling down, the wealthy just became wealthier. Privatisation of profit and socialisation of loss. Bhai, simple. Chutiya people deserve chutiyi goverment. Abhi aagey aagey dekho hota kya hai. Bas koi bhi sector main government kuch announcement karde, raato raat sab expert banjayenge aur kahenge how this is better for us. Eg:  Demo, GST, abhi economy.

Modiji/BJP tatti bhi laake denge toh log kahega wah ye toh Amrit hai. BJP is comparing this to 1991 economic reforms. We live in a time when subsidies and loan waiver to poor is considered ""freebies"" and doling out money to corporates is considered essential for boosting business. The underlying logics are just bizarre! Govt don't understand the meaning of ""Reserve"" in RBI. These (Govt) are the kind of people who would tell you they can't hear you because it's dark outside. Well OP, you don't really understand or have never run a business. See, we have 10 lakh people coming in the cities looking for jobs **every month**. This is from agricultural displacement + new entrants in the workforce.

We fill about \~5% of that.

Now, we are surrounded by countries like Indonesia, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Thailand and Malaysia. Each of them is growing YoY in **manufacturing** exports, women participation in workforce and GDP per capita **faster than India.**

Also, there is a unique situation in world trade where companies are looking to hedge their investments made in China due to a possible breakdown in trade relations with the US and China.

Any company who has to invest anywhere makes an excel sheet to check probable ROIs and compares it with their options. We had \~35% taxes while every single one of these countries had \~20-25%.

OP thinks because there is no demand for consumption, that's why there is a slowdown. **But how does demand arise?** Do you want the government to magically gift people money? People need to work to earn and save money. Money for a poor country like us comes in the form of wages and salaries from manufacturing. **They do not come through subsidies.** That road leads to Venezuela.

This move is not about bUyBAckS or dIViDEnds. They are still taxed (unfairly). **This move is about increasing the base.** 15% tax for new manufacturing units goes a long, long way. It has never been done in India before and it needs to be applauded. We don't even export as many clothes as fucking Bangaldesh. What the fuck are you talking about?

We are not rich. We are poor. We need capital. Lots of it. The **US has zero % capital gains tax for foreign investors.** This after being the largest GDP country in the world. Compare our attitude when Pranab Mukherjee made a retrospective amendment to tax one single company after losing a case in the highest court of the country. Lucid OP is lucid.

I disagree on reducing income tax as being workable in India however. Not enough people pay income tax or are eligible to do so. Doubt a reduction would make any difference since it would affect just a percentage of the middle class at this point. Most people earn below 2.5LPA.

The demand side issue at a larger level is not driven by taxation alone but (probably) low wages, too-many-bills, debt, stagnating rural income.

In my view, direct cash transfer using JAM should've been done. This ain't a bizzare world, it is just late stage capitalism Yeh govermint to tatti bhi Prasad samajh ke khilwaayegi. People's brains have been rotted inside out by the same brainworms that affect American conservatives. Even if you discount the clear chain of shitty budgeting between RBI and the tax cut, what reason could possibly drive salaried workers to cheer for corporate tax cuts? They would have to be insanely gullible or incredibly misinformed to believe the money's coming back to their pockets.

I'm going to sound like a tinfoil lunatic when I say this, but the sheer prevalence of the pro-capitalist pro-market narrative in India makes me think that thinktanks like ORF and Brookings are actively churning it out in ways that aren't quite visible to me (yet.) Is Modi our Reagan? Fuck. People are going to be unhappy regardless, so why give a fuck. Bhai, in simple words you are wrong in your understanding.

There are hundreds of up points of reducing corporate tax, at par with Asian countries. I'm celebrating it, but for a very different reason. 

As I understand it, it's not going to improve the government'*s* wealth. That's a good thing in my eyes, because lack of funds will keep a check on their madcap hindutva social misadventures like NRC. Was confused since a month wether it is a slowdown or a recession. The corporate tax cut just tilted it towards a recession. Time to cash out and run for the hills.... Hour will kaka get foreign funding for his party otherwise? Someone has to pay. >fucking idiots the bunch of them. And all you morons that celebrate this.

None bigger than you.

These tax cuts were promised for ages.
They will not only help ease the burden of the companies but they'll also aid demand owing to lower prices when the benefits are passed on.

Don't rant just for the sake it, nobody is giving the corporates any money, they are just paying less which is good because the consumer then will pay less. Don't forgot the $1 billion in aid to Russia. Corporate tax cuts are a necessary step to improve the economy, but it's not the only step. This is widely backed by evidence. I would like to believe evidence based policies rather than mindless opposition or support, whatever may be the party. This is from Kuvera's weekly email. 

Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman announced a $20 billion plan to reduce the effective corporate tax rate, including surcharges, to 25.17%. This move comes in addition to the RBI’s interest-rate reduction to stimulate economic growth. Ms Sitharaman said that the new corporate tax rates would be ""comparable with the lowest tax rates in the South Asian region and in South East Asia"". Further, she announced a tax rate of 15% for new manufacturing units in the country that start production before 2023.
 
In the aftermath of this announcement, the S&P BSE Sensex and the Nifty 50 both rose ~5.32%.

There is sufficient evidence that shows that lower corporate tax rates have a direct impact on growth. Prof Rebello of Kelloggs and Prof Jaimovich of the University of Zurich studied the corporate tax rates in the US since 1890 and its impact on growth. They conclude that cutting the corporate tax rate spurs growth if the current rate is exceptionally high, an assertion which is true for India. Prior to the tax rate reform, we had one of the highest corporate tax rates in Asia and also globally.  Ab India ko Amrika Banayenge. > fucking idiots the bunch of them. And all you morons that celebrate this.

Is your objective feel better about your superior understanding or raise awareness. Perhaps a more softer positive tone would ensure your message is better received and goes further.

To be fair not everyone understands economics. Took a bunch of economists to condense the whole macroeconomics to reduce it to this simple statement ""Basic economic policy will tell you that in economies with deman side issues, an income tax cut will have far better and far more extensive implications that a corp tax cut"" that you have written here as something very obvious

Honestly speaking fuck you. You're just a smug asshole who is angrily waving his fist at morons like us and feeling superior about your own understanding. It does not help anyone Source?

708,Policy/Economy,Workplace Surveillance: Your employer could be watching you,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f2mvuh/workplace_surveillance_your_employer_could_be/,"### 

https://preview.redd.it/7mv86kazrfg41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8f2d2839802afc223f409a31c337514b1e33c9b

### Tl;dr

IFF has prepared a public brief highlighting the impact of the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 on workplace surveillance. Technologies like CCTV cameras, location tracking and device monitoring have made it possible for employers to turn workplaces into a panopticon, and such pervasive surveillance undermines the dignity of labour and the ability of workers to unionise. We encourage you to read the brief and participate in the consultation being held by the Joint Parliamentary Committee to ensure existing power imbalances between workers and employers are not exacerbated by the Bill.

### Your boss shouldn't be Big Boss

Much has been written about the exemptions provided under the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 for governmental surveillance but there is another form of surveillance which the Bill permits that we should all be worried about. Clause 13 of the Bill exempts employers from seeking consent prior to processing personal data of their employees for recruitment and termination of employment, provision of services and benefits, verification of attendance and performance assessment. With advancement in technology, employers now have the ability to continuously monitor the real time activity of their employees through CCTV cameras, location tracking, device monitoring etc. By allowing employers to track bathroom breaks, lunch breaks and meetings of employees, such technologies pose a threat to the dignity of labour and the ability of workers to unionise. 

### Recommendations 

In order to ensure that any workplace surveillance is strictly need based, context specific and minimize intrusion into the personal lives of employees, we recommend that the following changes are made to the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019.

1. The principles of necessity and proportionality should be included under Clause 13, PDP Bill 2019.
2. A mandatory obligation should be imposed on the employer to consult employees and seek their views prior to processing personal data under Clause 13, PDP Bill 2019.
3. The Data Protection Authority should be entrusted with the responsibility of issuing a Code of Practice for workplace surveillance under Clause 50, PDP Bill 2019.
4. The Code of Practice for workplace surveillance issued by the Data Protection Authority should impose a prohibition on monitoring of any unionisation related activity and prescribe penalties for the same.
5. Trade Union affiliation should be categorised as sensitive personal data under Clause 3(36), PDP Bill 2019.

### Read the public brief and engage with the JPC

For more information, we encourge you to read our public brief on the impact of the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 on workplace surveillance. The brief highlights the impact of workplace surveillance on the fundamental right to unionise guaranteed by Article 19(1)(c) and the fundamental right to privacy guaranteed by Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution. It further explains existing provisions relating to workplace surveillance under the Bill and discusses their pros and cons. Following from the earlier discussion, the brief finally recommends five changes to the Bill to ensure that the existing power imbalances between employers and employees are not exacerbated by pervasive workplace surveillance.

If you are a trade union or employee association which needs more information about the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019, please feel free to reach out to us at policy@internetfreedom.in. We encourage people to share this brief widely in their circles and participate in the consultation being held by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Bill. You can participate in the consultation by sending comments via email to [**jpc-datalaw@sansad.nic.in**](mailto:jpc-datalaw@sansad.nic.in) and [**mrs.mlekhi@sansad.nic.in**](https://saveourprivacy.in/admin/entries/blog/mrs.mlekhi@sansad.nic.in) by 25 February 2020.

Even though these were bills quite unnecessary, they have been introduced to blind us from the truth, to fight amongst each other, instead of questioning the government on real agendas.

Why is our economy still down? Don’t give me bull about global recession, it is an event independent of the global recession

Why aren’t we getting new green policies when we are in an event of MASS EXTINCTION where thousands of species are dying every day?

What measures are being taken to ensure women’s safety in our country?

What happened to mission 2020 superpower?

Whatever happened to the 5 trillion dollar economy?

The hens are coming home to roost. Better deliver on your promises BJP"," I dont know if it's just me because I left India in 2018 

But I feel that the government is feeding propaganda to the people and those who have  sense to see more  clearly are conveniently labelled ""anti-nationals"" 

This might be unpopular but take for example the Balakot strikes 

The Government has given no solid proof of  ANY casualty though media claims ""300 terrorists"" were killed

No one can hide 300 bodies in a day especially not without others noticing from satellites 

Either the number is highly exaggerated or the strike failed and this was just a face saving 

It is also predicted next year there will be a global market crash

With current state of the economy that would be devastating to the country >instead of questioning the government on real agendas.

Sorry but development was on agenda in 2014, not in 2019. In first term BJP realized they can't deliver on growth and they can't manage economy. The only way to stay in power was communal hatred. The BJP supporters are very happy with what is happening right now. Just a thought.

NRC is fucked up and the CAA is going to help in the NRC process in the future. This is shady af. 

I get that.

But why the hatred for CAA alone? Shouldn't the hatred be Directed on the NRC-CAA?

CAA only focuses on the speeding up of citizenship for the minority refugees from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan into India thereby making us a safe haven for the minorities from the above mentioned countries.

In the CAA, there is no provision for muslims. But in truth, why would there even be ""muslim refugees"" from these ""muslim dominated countries""? [removed]"
712,Policy/Economy,Is this the future?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/edwj5r/is_this_the_future/," Sumit was adjusting his position in the bus, sweating in the heat. He saw his friend Shweta shift beside him. They were just returning from their official trip from Mumbai, back to Delhi. The bus had picked them up from the airport. 

Sumit was explaining to Shweta about how good the movie was. While he was explaining, he was simultaneously watching the road. He had a view of the road ahead. He spotted two SUVs parked across the road, as if to block it. He saw half a dozen people standing in front of it. His heart skipped a beat.

His body stiffened, and Shweta felt it. 

“What’s wrong?” she asked

“Nothing, just give me a minute” he said

He kept looking around and found a seat beside another girl in the back. He immediately got up.

“You should move there” he said, pointing at the empty seat.

“Okay, you’re just acting weird now. Why should I move?” she asked in a high pitch

“Don’t ask questions, please! Just go there!” he said as he grabbed her hand and almost forcefully lead her to the seat. He only had a moment to look at her face and he felt bad.

“Okay, I’ll explain everything later. Just don’t worry. Sit tight and you’ll be fine” he said

She pulled him back, standing midway between the seat they were sitting in and the seat he had chosen. They felt the bus slow down further, she had to hold on to the rails on the ceiling. 

“I’m not going anywhere until you tell me what’s going on!” she hissed

Sumit looked around, and while some were staring at what was soon appearing to be a mob blocking the road, some were staring at them. Sumit figured he still had some seconds before they got in. He grabbed her hand and took her to the seat they had been sitting in.

“We don’t have time. But this is the issue. I’m circumcised. They look like RSS mobs and they normally check the guys for this. If they see that you’re with me, they’ll assume you are a muslim too. I’ll manage, it’s okay” he whispered to her. 

Shweta took a few moments to register what she just heard, while she saw Sumit’s face turn scarlet. They were good friends, but this was a detail about that she didn’t know if she wanted to hear. 

“Shweta, just go!” he hissed, but at the same time wondering what she was thinking

“No, why should I leave you to fend for yourself? Please, I’ll tell them that you’re with me. That you’re my family. They--”

“No, they are going to check all the men anyway. There’s no point” he interrupted her.

They heard voices, and he forcefully grabbed her hand and took her to the other seat. He ran back to his, and Shweta could see his back was stiff. She was crying but realised that she couldn’t do anything at this point.

She saw two men barge inside the bus with wooden clubs and she could even see knife handles, from the knives tucked into their pants. One man was remarkably tall, with a thick beard and had a saffron towel around his neck. The other man was of average height and clean shaven. 

“If you cooperate, this will be over quickly and you can be on your way. I’m saying it now, don’t create trouble” the smaller of the two men announced.

“All the men come outside!” the tall man roared, so loud that Shweta flinched

She knew what this was going to be. She felt a huge pang of guilt. Her instinct of self-preservation took over. “Nothing could be done” she thought. 

Five minutes later, she counted 18 men come back. They were one short.

She didn’t see Sumit come back. She felt the bus lurch forward and she immediately ran to the driver

“My friend isn’t back yet! Please! Don’t leave already, he must be out there!” she screamed

“He’s not coming back *beta*” he replied calmly

“No no! He will come back!” she screamed at the top of her voice in desperation

She then collapsed to the ground, next to the driver howling.

\--

The year is 2038, in New Delhi, Hindustan. If you’re reading this from the past, you’ll notice that it’s not called India any more. It all started in 2016, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won a huge mandate and were lauded for their pro-development policies. 

Before I tell you what happened, let me tell you what else is going on with “Hindustan”. What Sumit and Shweta went through is just one instance. This is happening everywhere. They can’t check women, but they check men if they’re circumcised. If they are, the women they are with are also taken. 

The government is condemning this, albeit very mildly and of course the PM keeps tweeting how sad he is and urges not to engage in violence. The government keeps insisting that they have no hand in this, but it is the work of “miscreants” that they aren’t able to control.

Starting with the protests that erupted in the erstwhile India at the end of 2019, it soon emerged that the BJP after winning their second election with a landslide, were now enacting their core ideologies. 

In Social Media, Narendra Modi always appeared to be a man who treated everyone equally. However, it was in rallies that his actual persona could be seen. Millions watched helplessly as he brainwashed thousands every week. The BJP realised that all they needed was to brainwash the gullible. To tell them that Hinduism was under threat. That our country was going to the Muslims. 

Muslims were accused so many things. The economy bad? They blamed it on them. They accused muslims of impersonating Hindus to get away and practice their religion secretly. This rumour became more widespread when Muslims were left stateless after the National Registry of Citizens was introduced in 2020. 

So many protested, but turns out they weren’t enough. Protests weren’t the only thing required. People needed to un-brainwashed. People needed a good pair of spectacles to see clearly. 

The hard truth was, the number of people who believed in “Hindutva” outnumbered the others and this kept BJP in power. The BJP knew - all they had to do was campaign in rural areas and brainwash the gullible in the communally unstable places in India.

\---"," Beautiful... if anyone thinks that this just a random art of fiction then just go back 20 years behind the time and tell people that 20 years from now there will be mob lynching on the basis of people seeing cow in a vehicle and the driver is lynched. Back then people would have laughed at this fiction but now we know its not  fiction anymore, same goes for the above post. No Modi in 2038 ?

Anyway, it could happen ! Holy shit. You had me in the first half. I was fuming and was fearful at the same time.

Not sure whether Modi would be around till 2038, let alone after 2024 (I see Shah being the PM candidate) but if we can't defeat them in 2024 election then yeah, I totally agree those days will come.

Edit: I hadn't read the title before and thought this incident actually happened. > all they had to do was campaign in** rural areas** and brainwash the gullible in the communally unstable places in India.

I would like to read something on how BJP (+other RW) is more powerful in rural areas over urban areas."
713,Policy/Economy,Are investors using government's FDI policy to re-pump black money in to the economy? Possibly yes.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/417lmk/are_investors_using_governments_fdi_policy_to/,"Bringing FDI is the new mantra for developing Indian economy so much so it is now considered only occupation worth pursuing for Indian PM and FM. Indian PM Modi makes a round trip of the world with impressive slogans and grants to bring much needed money  but little does he know or care at least till now that most of the money that do come to our country is the money that we couldn't collect in the first place. 

While FDI may not be such a bad thing in itself, one still needs to ask what these all FDIs coming to our country consist of and where exactly are they going.

>Answer: Black Money goes out of India for the reason of evasion of tax, however the money which flows out get’s negligible earnings on interest rates hence it flown back into India by various means to make an even bigger earning. **One of the important ways in which Black Money flows back in is the FDI route**.

>**Why would a country like Mauritius, which is primarily dependent on tourism and sugarcane able to contribute to about 40 percent of our FDI inflows?** Black money which flows out, goes into a Mauritian subsidiary of a Indian (any national) company and comes back into the stock market through FDI route. This is what is called as Round-tripping ie the whole conversion of Black Money into capital investments and returns.

Could you also share the issues no matter how small or big with the education policies regarding all education ( including the universities such as JEE-IIT) . So far, we have been to two churches in the UK where we held coffee mornings and sold home made Indian food to raise money for the charity and to spread awareness of the issues. So far we have raised around £150 and gotten the churches to include it in their local newspapers and leaflets. 

If you have provided issues, thank you very much!

I'd also like for potential solutions you believe would have great impacts on educations as a whole in India. These could be solutions you have heard/seen being used in countries similar to India (culture/economic) such as China as they share many educational viewpoints and are both emerging economies.

715,Policy/Economy,"As an NRI, my personal view on the Serious emigration thread.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ddoz4c/as_an_nri_my_personal_view_on_the_serious/,"Here is the original thread: https://old.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dcquo0/serious_emigration_threat_is_it_helpless_yet/

As a person emigrated to Germany, I want to chip in my personal view as to what it takes to make me come back to India. 

tl:dr; I won't be back as of now! May be in future!

Long version:

u/ozonised has compiled very good list of what issues exists and what can be improved.

Infrastructure: I come from Hyderabad and being a capital city the infrastructure is shit! It took more than 10 years and massive amount to build a metro, and that too it's over the top metro not an underground. The roads are already congested and these fools installed metro pillars in between the roads, congesting it even more. The city sewage is still from the Nizams era and nothing substantial has been done to improve it. Every year in rainy season, roads and buildings are submerged in water.

Ride bike for one hour, take a clean cloth and swipe on your face, a black layer come off. That's the pollution in the city. Auto and public busses emit black gases from exhaust! You are literally breathing that shit day in, day out. Just creating better transportation does not make a place livable. You need to plan for the future and build something sustainable! There is no greenery in the city and becoming concrete jungle! Every year when I visit Hyd, I regret roaming on the streets because of that black smoke.

Please make the city more livable. Yesterday there was news about cutting down trees in Aarey park, mumbai to make way for Metro! We need to progress and build infrastructure considering nature not the other way round. It takes just a strong will to inspect/make every person riding a vehicle to follows correct emission standards.

Healthcare:  
Healthcare is completely different topic. Last year, as a challenge to get an MRI for my Cervical Spondylosis problem, my father asked me to get it done in Osmania Hospital. I visited for 20 days and tried to get an appointment with a Neuro doctor and MRI without paying a bribe, sadly I gave up and got it done in a private hospital.

Have you ever visited the pregnant ward in any govt hospital? If you don't puke, I would congratulate you. Imagine women carrying a child for 9 months and then delivering among other 20 women in a congested room and pathetic conditions. Healthcare is literally on their knees.

- Did you know 2 years back Indian mangoes were banned in germany because they were using chemicals to ripe them! 

You know what can be done? Just a good officer and good inspection to keep premises clean and healthy. Checkout the amsterdam cycling documentaries, the govt responded to the public demand and created more cycling infrastructure, so that people can bikle freely and resulting in massive decline in health problems.

Academics: 
The plight of private schools looting parents came to mainstream due to Delhi govt. Kudos to them for bringing awareness. Private schools are robbing and public schools are getting closed due to lack of funds!! Govt has no money to run schools but they make a 3k crore statue. I saw some days back in UP, a school was serving rice with salt as mid-day meal. Are we in such a fucking pathetic situation that we can not give a curry/dal with rice for our future generations? Don't get me started on quality of education. Why can't govt schools have English subject? Why do they have to teach only in regional language? I saw many govt school students under confident when they start college.

In Germany I can study for free until my PG. I can work under professors and also get paid handsomely if I do research. You know what, as a student I pay just 52€(4000 INR) for one semester/6 months and can take part or play as many times. Open the following link with chrome and translate it. https://hsp-hh.sport.uni-hamburg.de/sportangprogramm.htm. It would be mind boggling to know every student in the city can take part in so many sports. You would be overwhelmed when you see the sport infrastructure this country has! I have never played any sport except cricket and thankfully to Germany I played so many sports you can't even imagine and that too almost free! 

You can also take as many courses you want by paying 110€(8k INR) for 6 months. When you earn more then 2.5k€ every month 110€ for 6 months is nothing! Why would I leave this and come back to nothing, where I can get sick just by breathing that shitty air?

Policies: Check out the startup culture here in Berlin and Munich area. In India, we have so many IIT's and lakhs of students graduating every year. What is stopping the Govt from creating a Startup fund and make policies that encourage the fresh minds to create fresh Ideas? They have a startup fund and I guess it has gone to the wind! 

Me, My elder brother and younger sister all are CS students. We are actually working on our startup that would be headquartered in Germany and branch out in India. Do you know why? because we get better funding here and exposure is fucking awesome! Every city has Startup hacks/meetups/pitches! I don't want to start our startup in the red tape of Indian bureaucracy. To be honest, It's a shame that in a country like India, we are lagging behind in Startup world!

Employment: Better startup policies, better infrastructure, better education directly leads to creating more opportunities! No magic wand. I am in my 20s and working on my company, there are lakhs of people like me, but sadly working that shitty 9-5 job in some big company. Just look around and see the jobs created by Zomato and Swiggy, the cash they brought into market from consumers. Imagine startups like these on a massive scale! It would change the face of our country. Our economy needs to be more open and welcoming!

My brother used to work in East Asia and came back to India and he regrets every day. The daily commute, traffic jams, pollution is literally killing him. As the first comment from u/mrfreeze2000 says, ""There are two types of people who emigrate: better pay/lifestyle, and better work"". I Emigrated because of both. You know Its Illegal to make me work on Sat & Sunday. If an exceptional situation arises that I have to work on Saturday, my company has to get permission from Labour office!

- I get 6 weeks of Paid holidays + public holidays
- I can travel 27 countries. Just pack your bags and hop in your car. Los geht's!
- I get PR after working for 3 years or 2 years with German B1 certificate. No Shitty visa issues like in US of A. 
- I can become German citizen in 6-8 years.
- I can take as many sickness leaves i want. It's my right. I dont do it, just saying.
- If my wife is working and expecting a child, she gets 14(fourteen) months of paid maternity leave. As a father you can also take paternity leave.
- My whole family is covered under my Health insurance covering from fever to cancer. 
- Children go to awesome schools here to learn, they can take music as a subject or any sport and all of this is free.
- If I ever got fired, I get arbeitslosengeld(Job Loss money), for 1.5 years I guess.
- Better infrastructure, better health and Hospitals, better care, better money, better air. 

Lastly, I guess this was written by non-muslim person(sorry to bring in Religion). As a muslim myself, my father urges me not to come back to India ever, given the cancer that has spread in recent years. I have desis saying to my face anti-national or paki here in Germany and least I expect that India. I stopped going to Indian festival gatherings here because I fear some dickhead will ask why I came there and what is my intention. Some years back I could trust my fellow Indians and now I lost that hope. Just for reference check this tweet (https://twitter.com/rohini_sgh/status/1180165971006197765), this is the cancer our country has acquired! You don't know the humiliation we are facing these days. Every damn thing has been turned into whataboutery. The current regime spined the propaganda about minority appeasement? What minority appeasement, muslims situation is worse than SC/ST's and that too without reservation. 

Why would I leave all these and come back to India to suck all that shit? I love my country and think of it now and then, but do I miss it? Nah! Do I miss the culture? absolutely yes! Do I want to come back and live there? Nope. Sorry.

Edit: Thanks u/kash_if for the silver!

Edit: If anyone needs help with any issues like job, education just message me. I would be happy to help."," Awesome answer dude. You've put every point so precisely and there's no counter to any of that.

But, 'why would I come back to the place?' I'd give my answer to this. 

Because I am one of the few people who understand these issues.

Because I have power to solve one of these issues atleast to a tiny extent.

Because India sucking is as much a fault of the knowledged staying silent as that of the stupid ruling the roost.

(Bollywood answer alert!) Because it is my place! How many ever years I stay in any country, I wouldnt be considered as a localite. I wouldn't be able to say that this is my country. You said you are 28 and you have been in Germany for 8+ years, did you go there for your bachelors' degree? If yes, was the education free for bachelors'? 

Also, why doesn't Germany have a provision that parents of German(immigrant) citizens can also get German citizenship, like Canada?


Also, how is the treatment of Muslims in Germany, cause I heard the right wing is getting stronger there? Re Indian mangoes banned, it [was EU wide](https://www.livemint.com/Politics/fMXWwNQ0ZCL5ZjVAoGyhGI/EU-agrees-to-lift-import-ban-on-Alphonso-mangoes.html). There was also a ban on some vegetables which remained in place. Same reason: too much pesticide.

There have been similar alerts in [the UAE](https://www.thenational.ae/uae/uae-alert-over-pesticides-in-food-from-india-1.191984) and even the Indian press has [published stories](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/chemical-concoction-pesticides-in-veggies-and-fruits-harm-hyderabad-children/articleshow/65126763.cms) about it. Indians feel like people owe something to you. Indians take things personally. Like a comment here, a service would be considered as help and refused. When a service is refused - you know what it means. 

Fortunately, a service isn’t interpreted as help and thus not refused (as much as it is in India) abroad. I’ve noticed this and that’s just my two cents. The mentality of the people should change. Hyderabad doesn't have GEZ fee .... Germany has 😂😂 Nice post and agree with you. Currently living in South East Asia and I always want to move to Europe because of various reasons but the salaries and the taxes always make me think. Interesting read, OP.

I am curious, what is the status of racism against brown people in Germany considering the fact that there's been a sudden inflow in refugees over the past two years? 

Also, how long did it take you to get fluent in German? [deleted] Hi,
As someone living in Germany for quite some while and familiar other parts of Europe as well, which countries do you see having well established or a booming IT/tech industry at the moment/in the near future? 


Also, in terms of quality of life, ease of integration/emigration, and racial attitudes, and in general the culture how would you rank these countries?

Asking because I'm looking at emigrating to Europe as an option and would love to know your perspective. Ok, it seems like you're having a really good time in Germany and your quality of life is extremely well. I'm happy for you for that. You've risen out of the struggles of India and found some peace and breathing room in a more stable place. Good for you. I mean that.

Now, is it possible for you to return to Hyderabad permanently and still find a way to sustain yourself and those that depend on you financially? Considering you're a techie, there is a good (enough) market for software developers here so I think that is possible. If so, what is stopping you from doing that?

The reason I'm asking this is because you seem like an above average and sharp person. You've also had experience abroad which a lot of people do not have here. With all that in mind, your perspective and passion will be invaluable and the same goes for your siblings. If you're this passionate about your country while staying abroad, imagine what you could do for your country, your city or even just your locality if you were living here? So why aren't you here?

One reason could be that you really aren't financially stable enough to shift here, and that's ok. If that's not the case then the only reason left is that your passion is misplaced. You are only worrying about your ""home"" because you feel like you *should* or because you have family living there. When in reality you've subconsciously accepted your new home in Germany. It's either that or something else that explains why you're not in India trying to help with these problems you've mentioned.

See, all I'm hearing from your post is ""Please make the city more livable"". A plea coming from a non-resident Indian who will never go through the difficulties of achieving that goal (because he doesn't and won't live here) but expects the locals to do so. And inshallah we will do so, but not to set up cushions for you but to furnish our own cities.

Your post implies that us citizens are wilfully producing and promoting this black, ""shitty air"" that you mention when in fact, just in case you didn't know, we don't want this air just as much as you (actually, we don't want it more than you because we have to breathe it every day). This, if nothing else, keeps us motivated to change that and since we *are* living here we can directly try to change that.

So you can see why a rant about our ""shitty cities"" can sound hypocritical to our ears when we're trying to fix things here and someone who has just about none of a dog left in the race tells us to ""make the city more livable"". It sounds very condescending, like a rich merchant asking the poor peasants to ""hurry up and stop being poor"".

We're trying.

(And when I say ""you"" in this post I mean to point to every NRI that rants about the ""situation in India"" but hasn't contributed to anything significant to help with it.)

> do I miss it? Nah! Do I miss the culture? absolutely yes! Do I want to come back and live there? Nope.

I don't know why I wrote all this. You've said it yourself; you only want the good parts without having to have worked to remove the bad parts.

---

Also, I don't know why you're worried about coming to Hyderabad as a Muslim. I'm not the most politically educated but even I can tell you that Hyderabad is possibly the safest place for an Indian Muslim to live in (particularly a Hyderabadi Muslim). If you don't believe that then either I'm wrong or you've just proven how out-of-touch you are with your culture.  [u/ppcontentrobot](https://www.reddit.com/user/ppcontentrobot/), I wouldn't disagree with anything. You are pitch perfect on what's wrong in the country and I wouldn't blame you for choosing a better quality of life.

I wish I could just raise a wand and change the way things work in our country but unfortunately I just can't. So, I came down here and asked the world what's wrong and how we can influence change? Jingle bells, I wasn't cut out for what came back.

**If there is one thing I am sure of, it is of the fact that we just can't keep doing this forever.** 

Things around emigration will change drastically in the next decade and it will no longer be cut out for everyone. I wish we don't have to wait till we get hit to reform change. But you will always be a foreigner there and never feel truly part of the country, despite having citizenship, not to mention the huge rise in anti-immigrant sentiments in Europe, which although brought about by mass immigration from Syria and Africa, will also threaten to sweep up well-educated foreigners like you.

The sad truth is India is destined for mediocrity, democracy is holding it back as it is susceptible to vote-bank  politics and nothing ever gets done.

China also has lots of different ethnic minorities (although not as many as India) and the reason they managed to do so well was because of an authoritarian leadership. 

India's inability to get a grip with the population explosion is contributing to much of this misery we will have the same population as China by 2024 despite only having 1/3 the land mass, we are extremely polluted due to this population density and it is said there will be a major water crisis in the future.

More than 50% of our population is in agriculture, this is completely unacceptable and farming should have been heavily mechanised by now and the people moved to manufacturing or something like that.



All this because crap politicians will keep their grip on power by gaining the votes of uneducated lower castes who can easily be convinced. The smart Indians will always view going abroad as the ultimate dream because they know India is beyond saving. It's easy to avoid dirt and walk away but it takes guts to step into the mess and clean it. But can you get chai from a tapari in Germany? 

From my experiences in Europe and Latin America, I prefer a life in India. Yes, it has its hassles, but everything is pretty accessible here, and affordable to everyone. I am not denying the downsides, but I would like to list out something that we want to overlook for greener pastures. 

* Nothing to boast, but I find the holiday structure of govt opportunities here pretty neat. And more public holidays. Private sector sucks, yes.

* I can travel 29 states, as diverse as Schengen nations. Just pack your bags and hop in a bus or train. You don't even need a car, even to go to the remotest part.

* No need for any language certificate to be anywhere or work anywhere, free movement.

* I don't know whether I would want to be another citizen

* I don't know about as many, but its pretty neat here too

* yup, no paternity leave here.

* exists here too

* Children can play with other children, and go to good schools as well. Might not be as extensive as there in curriculum, yes.

* I think you pay much more tax too, for social security, but way def a positive.

* Not great at infrastructure, but hospital and care are def good in my state.

The only place I felt like settling in was urban Brazil. Felt like a dev version of India with the most diverse and welcoming people I have ever met. Very interesting response.

Its your choice as to where you want to stay - Hyderabad versus Germany, but I want to ask:

1. What are the laws about spitting and littering in Germany? Did you educate your family and friends in Hyderabad about them?

2. Can you have religious functions in Germany shouting slogans in the street?

3. Can a mosque have loudspeakers blaring azaan 5 times a day? Can you set up a slaughterhouse on Eid and slaughter goats in the name of religion in Germany?

4. Can you stand and say ""I am an immigrant and a Muslim"" in Germany?

5. Did you know that the pollution you are complaing about comes from vehicles and people attempt to pay bribes to get PUC certificates? Try that in Germany too.

6. Can you get fake degrees in Germany like in Hyderabad? Can you come out after Friday prayers and pelt stones there? Can you tamper with your electric meter?

I have lived in Hyderabad and several cities in India. Yes, things are not hunky dory and perhaps lots of things can improve. Some of us are trying to improve, but you chose to leave and go away to Germany.

And that's fine. If you don't want to return to India in 6 to 8 years,  please don't. Just don't lecture us about how much Germany is better. Keep in mind that if the Far Right takes power in Germany, you'll be the first one demanding for a ticket on the flight back to Hyderabad. 

All of these luxurious things you mentioned are available in Germany because of under population and plentiful resources/jobs. That is how things were in most developed countries (US is a case in point) a generation ago. Once the population increases and competition for jobs intensifies, things will swing to the other extreme and quickly. Remember the country you are boasting about has a very bloody history of discrimination, and not too long ago either. Itna nafrat h toh yaha post kyyu karte ho? India should stop leaning into NRIs as Victims. Indians living in India are victims, Farmers, students, graduates, patients, average earning consumers. When will we stop catering towards whats happening to Brown looking people in America. 

I as an Indian living in India don't fucking care if you are fucked in USA. ""Dhobi ka kutta na Ghar ka na Ghat ka."" Your sorry ass will ignore this statement as well. So fuck you and your Anti India minds just to fill your purpose. Indians must and should never help you.

Our Indian Health care is fucked and has gone way down because Indian born Doctors in US study from India and performs a rectal exam of some white crack head hillbilly, just because his skin is White and beautiful. He never will chose to do the same for Indian sewer cleaner. The color makes a huge difference. Hence the health Care is worst and people in India die everyday unlike America. Cuz Indians are always there to cure White people in exchange of dollars.

Fuck your immigration issues. I'd rather have an hardworking illlegal Bangladeshi or Pakistani in India than discussing or worring about your sorry ass in USA or Germany for nothing."
716,Policy/Economy,The Purpose of War (1984) - George Orwell,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ehjlce/the_purpose_of_war_1984_george_orwell/,"The primary aim of modern warfare is to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living. Ever since the end of the nineteenth century, the problem of what to do with the surplus of consumption goods has been latent in industrial society. From the moment when the machine first made its appearance it was clear to all thinking people that the need for human drudgery, and therefore to a great extent for human inequality, had disappeared. If the machine were used deliberately for that end, hunger, overwork, dirt, illiteracy, and disease could be eliminated within a few generations. And in fact, without being used for any such purpose, but by a sort of automatic process — by producing wealth which it was sometimes impossible not to distribute — the machine did raise the living standards of the average humand being very greatly over a period of about fifty years at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries. But it was also clear that an all-round increase in wealth threatened the destruction — indeed, in some sense was the destruction — of a hierarchical society. In a world in which everyone worked short hours, had enough to eat, lived in a house with a bathroom and a refrigerator, and possessed a motor-car or even an aeroplane, the most obvious and perhaps the most important form of inequality would already have disappeared. If it once became general, wealth would confer no distinction. It was possible, no doubt, to imagine a society in which wealth, in the sense of personal possessions and luxuries, should be evenly distributed, while power remained in the hands of a small privileged caste. But in practice such a society could not long remain stable. For if leisure and security were enjoyed by all alike, the great mass of human beings who are normally stupefied by poverty would become literate and would learn to think for themselves; and when once they had done this, they would sooner or later realize that the privileged minority had no function, and they would sweep it away. In the long run, a hierarchical society was only possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance.

To return to the agricultural past, as some thinkers about the beginning of the twentieth century dreamed of doing, was not a practicable solution. It conflicted with the tendency towards mechanization which had become quasi-instinctive throughout almost the whole world, and moreover, any country which remained industrially backward was helpless in a military sense and was bound to be dominated, directly or indirectly, by its more advanced rivals. Nor was it a satisfactory solution to keep the masses in poverty by restricting the output of goods. This happened to a great extent during the final phase of capitalism, roughly between 1920 and 1940. The economy of many countries was allowed to stagnate, land went out of cultivation, capital equipment was not added to, great blocks of the population were prevented from working and kept half alive by State charity. But this, too, entailed military weakness, and since the privations it inflicted were obviously unnecessary, it made opposition inevitable. The problem was how to keep the wheels of industry turning without increasing the real wealth of the world. Goods must be produced, but they must not be distributed. And in practice the only way of achieving this was by continuous warfare. The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labour. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent. Even when weapons of war are not actually destroyed, their manufacture is still a convenient way of expending labour power without producing anything that can be consumed. A Floating Fortress, for example, has locked up in it the labour that would build several hundred cargo-ships. Ultimately it is scrapped as obsolete, never having brought any material benefit to anybody, and with further enormous labours another Floating Fortress is built.

In principle the war effort is always so planned as to eat up any surplus that might exist after meeting the bare needs of the population. In practice the needs of the population are always underestimated, with the result that there is a chronic shortage of half the necessities of life; but this is looked on as an advantage. It is deliberate policy to keep even the favoured groups somewhere near the brink of hardship, because a general state of scarcity increases the importance of small privileges and thus magnifies the distinction between one group and another. By the standards of the early twentieth century, even a member of the Inner Party lives an austere, laborious kind of life. Nevertheless, the few luxuries that he does enjoy his large, well-appointed flat, the better texture of his clothes, the better quality of his food and drink and tobacco, his two or three servants, his private motor-car or helicopter—set him in a different world from a member of the Outer Party, and the members of the Outer Party have a similar advantage in comparison with the submerged masses whom we call ’the proles’. The social atmosphere is that of a besieged city, where the possession of a lump of horseflesh makes the difference between wealth and poverty. And at the same time the consciousness of being at war, and therefore in danger, makes the handing-over of all power to a small caste seem the natural, unavoidable condition of survival."," Everyone should read this. Just mesmerizing. I am speechless with the absolutely to the point logical flow of the events/causes. Never ever thought this. Never knew war had an economic purpose of social control. Orwell, thank you."
717,Policy/Economy,I read the Indian economic survey of 2018-9 so you didn't have to. Here are the highlights,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c95ykl/i_read_the_indian_economic_survey_of_20189_so_you/,"The biggest take-away was the direct attack on what the survey calls 'Anglo-Saxon economics'. Basically the concept of a general equilibrium theory. Instead it claims an economy is always within either a 'virtous cycle' or a 'vicious cycle'. 

A virtous cycle is characterised by rising investment, rising exports and rising savings. A vicious cycle is the inverse of that. 

The implication is that the government must intervene to steady the ship and any fantasy about 'rational actors' has to be abandoned.

The importance of higher savings cannot be underestimated accoring to the survey. It is only with high and rising savings that a country can **self-finance** high investments. Otherwise it must seek out foreign savings which gets translated into a high current account deficit which in turn makes it vulnerable during times of crises. 


They survey continually made mention of China and other fast-growing East Asian economies when making its case in countless graphs. It is clear what the chief inspiration is. 

Having very high savings naturally means having a correspondingly low domestic consumption. Thus, the only way to have fast growth when domestic consumption is subdued is through fast export growth. They survey made the case that because India still has a low share of world export market so there is plenty of scope to regain, regardless of trade tensions.

The survey made many other recommendations, of which judicial reform is one which caught my one, but the overriding theme of the survey was the call to abandon 'Anglo-Saxon economics', by which it meant general equilibrium theory. 

It'll be interesting to see if India truly makes a decisive economic policy break from the past as the language suggests."," Based on your summary, (and good of you to make the effort!) the economic survey is goobleydook. 

If they’re busy saying general equilibrium theory is Anglo Saxon economics (and somehow behavioral stuff is not?) then it’s some weird waste of time in the “you aren’t even wrong” kind of bad.

I’m going to go read it. Now one else has to waste their time on this shit. Literally /r/badeconomics. Thank you for your service to the nation. One of the worst economic survey's ever in the recent years. It was expected, given how the current CEA got his job,

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishnamurthy_Subramanian#Career

>In articles published in The Times of India and Livemint titled, ""Will Black Be Back? Why demonetisation will be revolutionary in India’s fight against corruption"", and ""Demonetisation: Are the poor really suffering?"", respectively, Subramanian supported the Government of India's banknote demonetisation policy in 2016. What didn't catch your eye

1. Nudge economics and excessive stress on behavioural economics -> it seems like a kind of foreshadowing and a prelude to ""excuses for data theft""

2. After speaking few pages on gibberish on big data and data, the govt reiterates the same lines as it did before aadhar judgment. Sovereignty of data, state security and providing cheap data to corporates while again, using the garb of security and ease of biz

3. All the wanking on beti bachao beti padhao being an immense success and swacchh bharat being a great success. Sorry to let you know, the chapters seemed kind of promotion than anything related to policy prescription. That's quite a downgrade, even under NDAs standards, given I haven't missed an ES since 2014

4. For all the bashing of anglo saxon economics. Do yourself a favor. Pick up es 2018, book 1. See chapter 1 or chapter 2 (basically the big chapter). In one of the boxes, where it compares to USA and then later in another of the chapters, where it compares savings and investment slowdowns across economies, it shamelessly uses Rodriks theory and proves, India shouldn't give a Damn about savings rate. This time it did a 180. 😂 Bro thank you for the effort You missed out The Nudge. The mass control program. They are gonna make robots out of people. For the first time ever, a government has openly admitted to using behavioral control. Just imagine the consequences of it as used in electoral politics. Thank you! Can you please ELI5 general equilibrium theory? I am little concern about mutual alienation between india and russia and in return US's backstabbing. 

Theoretically US-China's trade war should benefit india, but by the way US has treated us in the previous term i am not sure. High quality stuff.. thanks! [deleted] So is this a major policy break then? Is India ditching free market economics for some sort of a social democracy (e.g., like the Nordic Model) or are we adapting the managed-economy model of China? Could someone explain exactly what Nudges the govt is implementing?

I've read the book called Nudge by Thaler. It could be a good thing if done right or it could be Orwellian if done wrong."
718,Policy/Economy,"Guys, I am disappointed in the way we exploit the poor people of India!",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e3b9rc/guys_i_am_disappointed_in_the_way_we_exploit_the/,"We see poor people everywhere in this country, sometimes right in front of some extremely rich and posh areas, we see beggars trying to get a meal a day in front of the same malls where we throw away half of the expensive mall food we eat. We move to countryside , same case, thousands of small plots of land that barely feed them, government schools that barely educate them, social welfare policies that are worth billions that won't even cover their most basic of the needs, huts built on millions of tiny plots of land that barely counts as a home, billions in medicine that won't even help curing most common ailments. Enormous quantities of ration that isn't even the fraction of what is needed, all of that because they are born in the wrong place, to the wrong families, in the wrong castes etc.,

It just crushes my heart seeing all this injustice being done, the resources that could be utilized properly, i am extremely disheartened watching all this guys, very very disappointed!

Of such Inefficiency in exploitation!! I mean what the hell are we thinking?? Wasting all that food on these poor people when we can use it for our own amusement! Like we could use it to make a sport where we throw it into a river or something, or just put all that on the ground  and dance on it, maximizing enjoyment factor! All that billions of dollars wasted on social welfare and infrastructure for these people, instead the boring shitshow that is where we have to watch these people slowly starve to death, we could use the same to build thunderdomes and arenas where we make them fight for a fist-full of food, but then kill them anyway! Instead of wasting all this electricity and technology  to apparently ""elevate"" these people, you know what we can do? GIANT MACHINES!! Machines that can use these people as fuel like in matrix, we can just hook these people as soon as they are born in to these machines with a very thick chord that connects them to the machine through their ass. We hook these people upside down inside these giant machines and mine cryptocurrencies from their butts!! Think about it, we can use this butt currency to improve our economy, place bets in the death matches etc!! Our country is going to be a 5 trillion dollar economy in a few months, imagine if only the select few of us could enjoy all of that!! We.. We could be like a self sustaining switzerland backed by ass crypto! 

I mean seriously think about this, it is a much more humane way of living for these people over whatever the shit quality of life they have now!!

Just my two cents!! Join me in supporting for a humane and prosperous India, lets get rid of poverty and illiteracy* by locking up the poor!


^^^*only ^^^poor ^^^illiterates ^^^count."," Apparently, 30% of the population is below poverty line. That is they live by dollar a day. A lot of time we don't see them because we live in a bubble. Your security guards and waiters mostly come from Bihar and NE. And there are much lesser jobs our countrymen do. Its the middle class that is getting the D in india was that an attempt at mocking the underprivileged?  

>lets get rid of poverty and illiteracy\* by locking up the poor!  
>  
>\*only poor illiterates count. >Our country is going to be a 5 trillion dollar economy in a few months

Wrong fact.

Just get one thing straight, it doesn't matter however targeted programmes you run, there is only one way to remove poverty, that is is rapid economic growth. Rising tide lifts all boats. You may not want it but the country needs 10 more Mukesh Ambani’s so that they can employ millions and thus there is some hope for some people. Just see Chinese example, they didn't care about people opinions, they picked them from villages, provided them jobs, housing, medical and thus created chain of people coming out of abject poverty.

Though I am well aware this can't be implemented in India. [deleted] Hi,

So I feel the same way. You can't really change generations of class divide, however change yourself.

Treat everyone with respect. I say thank you and sorry to watchmen, chefs and Walters and try not to disturb them too much. Just be kind and understanding to all. Try not to dress too fancy all the time. Remember the zeros on the left side of your net worth matter alot, but after a while the zeros on the right and side matter less. 

Try to live a humble life. Never waste food or try to do so if possible. Try to use public transport and just be nice person who doesn't show off his or her money or parents money. Just don't give money in charity, but time also by volunteering for a cause you think you are good at. You don't know how many lives you cand drastically improve indirectly. I get confused with the term ""poor people"" offlate. At least, majority of those who qualify under the ""poor people"" category in cities don't really fall under this group as they earn really well, but in ""unaccountable ways"" aka without any taxation. How they spend their money is a different matter though. Most of these poor people earn a hand full in cities or don't earn because they are lazy (and not because of lack of opportunities). 

I feel every time I get exploited by these ""poor people"" rather than I exploiting them - it starts with almost everyone who fall into this BPL category and they will try to extract as much as possible from you or cheat you or want to get away with half baked work. Take your maid, auto driver, road sweeper, vegetable seller, construction worker, etc etc etc.. Just this evening, I am fooled with poor quality apples in spite of paying the amount he asked for it. 

PS: i am specifically referring to these fake poor people in cities and not the real poor, mostly outside big cities & towns, who struggle to meet ends inspite of hard work."

Indian MODIA always combines these two things for the personal benefit of TRP. Why can't have qualified sports ministers like her? So her sister is a cop and was blackmailing her, interesting little nugget about cops and Indian families. This is a significant change in India. Sports persons from economically weaker sections of society are coming out. They have the hunger to win. That is what separates them from those who are born with a comfortable lifestyle.

736,Sports,Pleasantly surprised with the amount of sports Hotstar is making available.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dvrc4w/pleasantly_surprised_with_the_amount_of_sports/,"Hotstar is currently streaming U17 Women's Football Tigresses vs Panthers match. Why it's surprising that this match is being streamed:

* It's not cricket. Non-cricket sports have generally not been broadcast unless super important
* It's women's game. Great to see women's matches being broadcast.
* It's U17. It's not even the top level side.
* It's a domestic match. It's not some FIFA WC Qualifier.

Other than that, more domestic cricket matches are being streamed now. Today a few SMA trophy matches were streamed and an U19 match vs Nepal was streamed.

Hockey Olympic qualifiers were also streamed, for both men and women.

Pro Kabaddi has obviously had a lot of success too.

I don't follow other sports much, but a few badminton opens were also streamed AFAIK."," Hotstar VIP is such a value of money. They always mess up the telecast via dish tv like how showing cricket in all star sports channels. Hotstar even telecasts esports. That's how deep they go. The quality is shit sometimes, but I can live with it. 

Now, if they could get AEW on their channel, literally everything I watch will be on Hotstar. I watched all of CWC and IPL on HotStar. My subscription money has been earned back easily Don’t forget the f1. Though the coverage is not comprehensive, like they don’t telecast fp1-2-3. But still a place to watch the qualifiers and race. The only issue I have with Hotstar is that their sports streaming quality is so bad! Low bitrate and an awful player ; I tend to find other streams even though I subscribe to Hotstar. Yes it's really good with the different kind of sports it's making available. Badminton coverage has been excellent.

Wonder how much the media rights for a U-17 women's football were acquired for (maybe free, it has only 4 teams). It's being organized by FSDL which is a Reliance subsidiary. For a newly launched event getting listed on streaming sites like hotstar and jio would be a boon. They stream F1. <3 Does it work with Chromecast? To the football fans, Hotstar is definitely a treat, up along with Jio TV which also shows some not so top level matches .

And even *Full Replays*…!! 

Its so amazing.

If I miss a match somehow due to timing etc, I can just see  the Replay 

Plus all the HBO shows!

It's definitely better than Prime or slightly better at the same price range

The only downside being its data consumption being too high, higher than Netflix and Prime Video. Where can I watch wrc races? I took the vip subscription just to watch ISL. Its definitely worth the money and also you can watch multiple sporting events. Hoping that the upcoming Olympics will also be streamed. Who here watches Women's football and what makes it interesting? I tried watching the world cup game; was boring so I'm interested in knowing if it's worth watching again. If yes, please suggest matches/teams/leagues. Now its even streaming endgame in hindi , and is all set to get most of the disney plus content , along with most having localisation in indian languages , netflix will have to DRIVE ahead fast , tailgating PrimeVideo to actually compete with them in india. Yeah hotstar has been a great boon for the neglected sports in India. 

Plus the fact that they have shows like Chernobyl make the deal even more worth it. I wish they stream chess. How to watch hotstar from outside India anyone know [deleted] I feel hotstar vip / premium at 1000 Rs for a month is very much value for Money."

Tanning is not a problem but hyperpigmentation is and sun exposure leads to hyperpigmentation in some individuals like pigmentation around the eyes, freckles, mouth etc . Also sun is very harmful for our skin .So I would recommend do not go out in the sun especially girls because female skin is more prone to hyperpigmentation and sun damage . And it is very difficult to treat hyperpigmentation of indian and black skin tones. If your parents advised you to not go in the sun at an early age for whatever reason indirectly they did a favour to you . But if you still want uneven skin tone then that's your choice. And do you guys think sania mirza never went to a dermatologist for skin treatments ? I can tell by looking at quality of her skin that she did had treatments. And all of these treatments make your skin fairer then it was before treatment , although not fair then your natural complexion."

Although I don't see F1 surviving the end of conventional fuel era for that long. ""GP2 government... GP2 government. Aaargh!"" This track and other mega infrastructure projects like it are a testament to our quashed hopes and dreams as a nation. When I graduated from school in 2006, we all really did think that India would be a great and prosperous nation in 20 years.

I don’t know why I am posting this.. Guess, I am just tired of getting rejected...

I’ve started feeling that I should quit and start doing something new. But the thing is... I’ve never thought of any other profession. Being a journalist made me happy, but lately I’ve started feeling that I am just not meant for it...

P.S. [edit] I did work for several brands, but during my last job tenure I ended term with some animosities with the employers. Also, it feels like I am venting here while typing the issue. Nonetheless, it’s a pickle."," You have everything you need right there with you, just look around, start writing the stories you always wanted to write, there is a whole wide world of social media options to choose from on how to broadcast what you write to everyone out there. If your stories resonate with your audience, definitely you will be able to better target your stories and start monetising your talent. All the best. Why are you unable to get a job? What's missing? Hey you could open your channel and let the viewers donate. Many people are doing this independent journalism. Like Faye D Souza who just opened her channel after being fired(or she just quit?). Look for these channels as well Kumar Shyam, Aam Press Tv. Get you own channel Try newslaundry I’m no expert, but maybe try writing your own articles, opinion pieces etc. and use free platforms like YouTube n such. Or offer them to local newspapers and magazines. Once you’ve got sufficient ‘by lines’ you could apply to bigger publications. There is a great dearth of good, well researched and independent journalists in India. Most of them now are pushing some agenda or ideology. Print journalism may still have some integrity but electronic media is a cesspool. Before even switching on the television, most of us can predict the spin each channel will put on a certain event. 

Journalists are much needed for this country. The battlefield of the 21nd Century is going to be information and attention with you people being the force multipliers of the arena. Though you are struggling now and have stumbled, don't falter.  Good luck OP! Find your niche and everything shall follow. Do not feel disappointed. Try getting in touch Newslaundry? Apna business khol do didi. Digital content marketing aur baaki sab. Write your own article and slowly build up your website. Best of luck. write a book. anything that's stopping you from doing that? as in the beat that you cover is not popular etc? I agree with most of the opinions here: if you aren't in bad place financially, start your own channel/blog, and publicise the hell out of it on FB/Reddit/IG whatever. It doesn't require a lot of initial investment (financially atleast), and you'd also be adding worthwhile experience to your portfolio, further making you an attractive candidate later down the line.

If you need any help setting up something, you only need ask! You have it in you already, you just need to go ahead and give it your best shot.

You can do it OP; we all believe in you! :-) Happens. Do introspection. Figure out what is missing. Work on small small things > Guess, I am just tired of getting rejected

No one has the authority or power to reject you. You allow others to do so. So, there is no point in getting tired or feel bad. Rather, I see such 'rejections' as a difference of opinion, thats it..

Journalism, in the age of digital, is one of the most exciting things to do. Keep expressing your views, via words, videos, images, and choose a platform to do so. Facebook, Twitter, Youtube are the current hot favourites, and if you are consistent, the right eyes will see you, the right ears will hear you. 

7 years of experience doesnt matter in this dynamic industry.. Your voice, your persistence, and your unique angle of viewing things does.

All the best! Have you tried Zee News? Maybe your writing sucks ? OP, the market is currently fucked.

The options that are available aren't really lucrative and the options you want aren't going to become abundantly available anytime soon. Brace yourself for a long 'winter'.

I'm gonna make a few assumptions about you in this response and I apologise if any of them are wrong.

Being a journo in these trying times is a difficult gig for several reasons. Traditional media has frozen/slowed hiring because they are not sure their existing ways and methods will survive. New media requires an additional skillset that not many traditional journos readily have. Companies are looking to hire hybrids - candidates who can seamlessly switch between traditional and new media. You might want to consider re-skilling or upskilling yourself with a certificate/course from somewhere reputed.

This is above and beyond the fact that some places are just shit to work at - you know the one's I'm talking about. Most middle management in media is either incompetent idiots or assholes on a power trip.

That leaves you with independent journalism, which is way more difficult that most people believe it is.  Any idiot can put up a YouTube video (and most idiots do) but good, proper journos will agonize over every little detail and end up not posting anything. Independent journalism is a difficult, uphill climb but the view from the top is worth it.

My recommendation would be hit up your contacts from your job days and pitch them specific stories/ideas/solutions pertinent to their brand. Design your pitch such that it plays to your strengths and their needs. You'll get probably one meeting every ten pitches and your first okay after ten meetings. Be prepared for that.

Alternatively, you might want to do a John Galt (not a great example) and work in something completely unrelated.  This will help you in two ways - one, it'll help you earn some money, and two, it will give you the option of getting away from it all for a short while.

Good luck, OP. I   would   like   to  suggest   that   you   think   long   and   hard   about   how   much   effort   you've   put   into   your   career   versus   how   much   more   it   has   to   offer.   The   reason   being   I   have   a   friend   who   is   trained   with   two   relevant   degrees   and   a   masters   in   their   field   also   who   seems   to   be   struggling   to   find   regular   sustainable   work.    

It   might   be   that   unless   something   ""dream   job""   worthy   came   along   you   will   need   to   work   part   time   in   your   field   and   supplement   it   another   way.

I   wish   you   good   luck."

RumTum Tesla ki baat kar raberahe ho It's not just import duties. I drive a Tesla. This car won't survive in Indian conditions without heavy modifications. The clearance is too low, the materials and paint too susceptible to the constant battering Indian roads provide, etc.

The core issue remain that they're expensive and this will be just another luxury vehicle that won't sell because the country simply doesn't have the infrastructure to support EVs. Anything that is environment friendly should have no import duties! Then don't import and build it in India. Why is the deer not working lmao? They are high cuz govt don’t wanna import them. Make them here China is far ahead of us in electronics manufacturing. Opening the door to imported EVs now would mean killing off the domestic auto industry and ushering in Chinese imports. Further, these EVs are not going to be powered by renewables, they are going to be powered my electricity which is produced in India by burning coal, which is worse than Petrol vehicles, so there is no real environmental benefit in switching to EVs today.

We need to make our electricity grid less dependent on coal and while doing so simultaneously get the infrastructure ready to produce EVs domestically in India so that they are at least somewhat competitive compared to imports, and only then push for their adoption. This means that there needs to be a phased adoption plan which industries can depend on to decide their investments and production targets. 

Allowing Teslas here today at no import duty does not really make any sense. Electric vehicles and super cars needs better infrastructure which is only seen near airports. If a normal consumer has pot holes and water logging on his street then he won't be encouraged to buy such vehicles. Surprise, let me guess so are taxes and having to pay a wage to workers.  Can't everyone just get on their knees throw money at them and beg for these saviours to grace us Good.

Just a general observation on the worldviews Indians have.
If you take a look at the article, you'll find some comments. The comment section is enlightening.

""Natural couples can procreate, but unnatural cannot..If unnatural is to become a norm, then we have to think seriously of bio-ethical issues arising therefrom..Better go the nature's way though we have got freedom, we can use it either way.""

""Shows a great decline in ethical and value understanding, forgetting what our ancestors (the great rishis) and developing a slavish western educated attitude(so-called modern)
Doom is near when we forget ours roots.""

This is a very very *healthy sign* that the times we are livin' in is 1319,not 2019.
As for the rishis,if this gentleman had the time to look into our scriptures,he would find the Ardhanarishwara form(which celebrates feminity). Countless other refutes could be provided.
It's high time,we step up the ante,and counter them. These kind of mentality would only cause our society to move towards an intellectual dark age.

If it was some cricketer the whole uneducated jio troll brigade would have gone nuts! They can't even digest a guy posting a pic with her wife... [deleted] You go, girl! 👏 glad to see india is changing ... and for the better ... Man, I wish her the best in life. We should be proud of her for being brave enough to come forward. लोग क्या कहेंगे।।

लोग चादर्मोद है, कहने दो।।

What would people say,

People say assholes, let them blabber 😁 Great step to get public and help others also to accept. More power to her. More Power to her 🤗 It's good to know that she is proud to announce that publicly but I wonder how her career is gonna turn out in future. The environment and society around her will surely not be that supportive. WITH HER COUSIN!  Dude I can support being gay but I draw the line at incest. Yay! Yay! One of the finest Indian athletes has come out. This is really big. More power to her <3 What a Goddess. Really appreciate her doing this. Glad India is progressing. This is amazing! I love it. I just think it takes a lot of guts and support to do what she did i.e. acknowledging her relationship to public even after the Sec.377 some people still don't want to accept the fact that yes same-sex relationship do exist.. 
Thank God India is Changing Brave lady Glad to hear someone speaking up. Now, that's progress.  
Feeling proud! Wonderful! Good on her 👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩✊ Respect her decision to confess this!  ***Keep Calm and Marry On !!!!*** You go girl!! There is a really good radiolab episode on her - https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/dutee. She discusses about genders and her ban. Good for her. Hope she doesn't get harassed by the wonderful people in our country. Fantastic! What a great role model. It's hard to be out in India, but those that are able to do it do such an important service to all the struggling young LGBT kids. I'm so proud of her! 

Speaking of Indian lesbians, I recently watched Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga. I'll be honest, I've always disliked Sonam and Anil Kapoor for their acting. But the movie, was really touching. 

It helped a lot that Sonam didn't wear much makeup and it was not glamour-themed like most movies are. It helped to focus on the plotline which I think was VERY cute. 


PS: if anyone has seen the movie, can you tell me what the name ""Kuhu"" Means? It's an adorable name. Thanks Is anyone even reading that a 18 year old woman went into a relationship with a 14 year old kid? If this was a straight relationship, the lot of you would be running around with pitchforks and candles by now. Yeah nice. We gotta reason to burn her images. Yay Indians get to work. I wonder why....ahahah I didn't read the full stop after soulmate and thought she was in love with herself. Godspeed! It's a similar situation all over the world. No pro footballer will accept that he's gay ( while he's playing ). I mean, it's brave of her and everything. And I'm totally for it. But isn't she in a relationship with her cousin's daughter? Okay serious question.

Dutee Chand has been found to have high testosterone because of hyperandrogenism. She was even banned once by IAAF all though got reversed later. Does her high T has to do anything with her sexual orientation? Isn't she the same ahtelte who was suspended or something for not being a woman? Good for population control. Go girl ! Nobody cares! Isn't homosexuality harmful when we see it purely based on evolution ?? [removed] [deleted]"

749,Sports,"One of my teachers in our school beats students very inhumanely, help !",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eta25e/one_of_my_teachers_in_our_school_beats_students/,"Our sports teacher beats students black and blue over trivial things like not standing in proper position while doing prayer or not following his barbaric discipline! Everyone knows it but no one does anything about it. What should I do? this outright cruel and should be stopped. Many students report being traumatized after his punishments. I need immediate help. What should I do?

PS: I study in 10th. I have only studied in this school for a year and i can't take this anymore. Please help"," beating students is a punishable crime, no teacher can beat a student. You have the right to report it to the police. Maybe someone else more knowledgeable can pitch in with the details. Long ago, when I studied in KV Firozpore Cantt, we also had a sports teacher, Mr Sharma who used to beat up the kids, especially the small ones from the primary section. One day, he beat up one such kid and broke his leg with a hockey stick. What he did not know was that the kid's elder brother was the local goon. Result: Sharmaji ended up in the hospital the next day with several broken ribs and fingers. After some months he returned to his job but never again touched a child. Post it on Twitter to @NCPCR_ - the national commission for protection of child rights. Don't even bother with videos or anything - just tell them that this is happening and it's not right. 

It's illegal to physically punish a child in India. He has no right to beat a defenseless little kid. 

Also please ask your parents to complain to the police or to the district magistrate. Il Write a letter to your principal signed by everyone in your class, if he/she already knows about it write it to CBSE or whichever board you have, also to education ministry telling in depth of incidents. Go to the police with an adult and report it immediately. Why are sports teacher always so sadistic? Why do they have a case of repressed anger? From someone elses quora answer: 

>  Beating or abusing a student is a punishable offence under
RTE Act, 2009 Section 17( 1) 17(2),
JJ Act, 2000,
IPC
Section 305,
Section 323,
Section 325,
Section 326,
Section 352,
And above that it is cruel and sadistic…..

As someone else said, first step would be to go to the principal/teacher.
Second step would be to go to the police.

You can also try using this feature: https://www.childlineindia.org/a/report/case , there is an option to keep your contact details confidential. Arrange for video shooting the act. Post it in Twitter, describing the situation, mention education and HRD misinsters in the tweet. Sports teachers are usually temporary. If parents come together and complain, they can remove him I am truly sorry this is happening. It boils my blood.

Get adults/parents involved as soon as possible. Convince them to reach out to the School and to the Police if it does not stop. Also, ask your classmates/fellow students to do it too, so at least someone would be sensible even if your parents are not being supportive. did you talk to your parents about this? They might help you by talking to the principle. Have you told your parents about this?

IF you haven't yet, do so now.

Speak to your peers as well and get them to speak to their parents about this, you all can write a petition and go to the principal of the school about it.

If the approach above does not seem like the way you'd want to go, then

# Dial 1098

They will assist you, please don't hesitate to call them, they will listen to whatever you have to say and please urge your peers to do so too.

Also, please keep us posted on progress with updates to this post.  
All the best! My sports madam once put used oil from the school canteen in our hair when we hadn't oiled them from home. We all had that one teacher. And 10th grade students don't do anything?
Lol here in Gurgaon the teacher would have been beaten to shit the moment he stepped out of the school premises. If you are afraid of reprisals and dont have any other way out - 

1) Create a new throwaway account.  Not very difficult for someone to connect the throwaway to this query, but there are these kind of PT teachers all over the country.  Hopefully you are not the only internet savvy kid in your class......

2) Post your school and tormenter on the new post with the throwaway account .... and every one of us, can use our twitter/channels to highlight the issue.  We'll report it, write to the principal, local cops.  Nothing like shining some light.  They may not take it seriously from a random stranger or two, but hopefully some of the other kids will speak up when questioned.

Stay well, and dont let this get you down.  Better you do something to fix this, than look back when you are 30 years old and wish you would have done something. Think very carefully before you do anything, this is india, if the pt teacher is connected to the principal then the principal can make your life living hell, theres no such thing as an anonymous complaint in india, they can easily find your name Dude. Inform the CWC i.e Child Welfare Commission and ask them to get case filed under s. 75 of the Juvenile Justice Act. Twitter pe photo video daal. Tag news channels and child ministry. Sit back and enjoy Please notify other parents about this teacher so that PTA members can speak to the Principal about this asap. Alternatively, you can write a letter with regards to any recent incident involving said teacher, (mention that corporal punishments aren't allowed in school and if action isn't taken y'all are willing to go a legal route or call the media) and have it signed by students and parents in your class. All the best and keep us updated!"

751,Sports,Tablighi Jamaat & Covid,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ftltyk/tablighi_jamaat_covid/,"It was extremely irresponsible for the members of the Tablighi Jamaat to have gathered in light of the covid pandemic. An FIR has been filed against the Maulana & others and hopefully the police will carry out a thorough investigation and the Court will determine whether they've violated any of the laws applicable and punish them accordingly.  


Let's look at certain facts pertaining to the situation.  


1. Firstly, this was a 3-day religious gathering, between [March 13-15](https://twitter.com/AtishiAAP/status/1244892528945565696).  
And this was much before the lockdown in Delhi (from March 23) & the Nationwide lockdown (from March 25).
2. The Delhi Government has alleged that the Tablighi Jamaat's 3 day religious congregation amounts to a violation of their [Order dated 13.03.2020](https://twitter.com/AtishiAAP/status/1244892528945565696), which prohibits *""all sports gathering (including IPL)/ conferences/ seminars beyond 200 people"".*   
\-  Note that this Order was issued on March 13, the very same day that the event had already    begun, implying that the attendees were already in Delhi by the time the Delhi Govt issued the order.    
\-  Courts will have to determine whether the wording of the order *""all sports gathering/ conferences/ seminars beyond 200 people""* will cover this 3-day religious congregation.  
\-  [The FIR](https://twitter.com/DelhiPolice/status/1244983752314564608) filed also alleges criminal conspiracy, which will also have to be investigated and proved before the Court. 
3. So essentially, the legal process has been initiated against them. And if they did violate any of the existing orders or law in question, they will be punished.  
In this light, holding a media trial is uncalled for. We don't even have all the facts in the public domain.   
For instance, the [Delhi Govt itself blames the police](https://twitter.com/AtishiAAP/status/1244892528945565696) for not having enforced its March 13 Order, given that the Nizamuddin Police Station is right next to the place where the religious congregation took place.
4. Further, a quick look at the general mood of the country as on March 13, points to the fact that concepts such as ""social distancing"" & ""self-quarantining"" weren't popularised by the Governments to the extent that we see today.   
For instance, as on March 13, the number of cases we had was 81, as opposed to the 2000 cases today, and addressing reporters, Health Ministry Joint Secretary had said on March 13 itself, that [coronavirus is not a health emergency & there is no need to panic.](https://theprint.in/health/coronavirus-cases-rise-to-81-in-india-govt-says-covid-19-not-a-health-emergency/380819/) 
5. A number of events took place between March 13 and March 22 ( Janata Curfew), followed by the Lockdown, involving huge numbers of people - religious places of worship with thousands of devotees, political events including toppling a certain state government, etc.  


While legal action has to be taken against people flouting the law, be it Hindus, Muslims, whoever, holding a media trial and bashing the entire Muslim community & trending CoronaJihad, does no one any good. In fact, it alienates the Muslim community even more & spreading more hate against muslims at large is irresponsible & criminal in itself."," > While legal action has to be taken against people flouting the law, be it Hindus, Muslims, whoever, holding a media trial and bashing the entire Muslim community & trending CoronaJihad, does no one any good.

It's too late dude. Many people in my community now believe that muslims are deliberately spreading covid19. Even my parents think that muslims have ""shown their true colors"". These 2000 idiots have increased hatred for rest of the muslim community."

*Tips:*

1. Believe only the verified information from reliable source.
2. Be careful and alert in public, keep an eye out for sick, coughing peoples nearby.
3. Keep distance from people. Can be friends or colleagues.
4. Careful buying food, groceries etc. don't touch foods if you don't have to.
5. Wash hands [properly](https://www.who.int/gpsc/media/how_to_handwash_lge.gif).
6. Avoid Handshakes, Use verbal greetings instead.
7. Cough within [elbow angle](https://images.megapixl.com/1783/17830764.jpg).
8. Don't touch anything if you don't have to e.g. Bus, Train, vehicle poles and door handles.
9. Carry Hand sanitizer if you can.
10. Apply the sanitizer on area you touch like ATM, bus poles or other public used things you need to touch. ( little awkwardness in public is better than getting sick )
11. Non-essential gathering in large groups must be avoided. e.g. sport events, concerts, meetups etc.
12. Get more information from [WHO.int](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) or other verified research institute.
13. suggest..

*Thoughts:*

Personally called few numbers to correct the map address. Found out in gMap they had different names. So please check the map links and make sure you're going to right address. Before calling them do your research. ""Get  info"" calls can make a line busy and  real people in need suffers.

When calling few centers myself, a person received my call asking if they are the govt assigned center to test corona, he got scared at first just by hearing the name. Which made me wonder how less information he might have about the pandemic. I hope you get all the right information about this threat. Wash hands as much you should, definitely more. And please be kind to others, if you feel sick of corona symptoms please do not take it lightly. Get help, ask for help. Do use mask, self hygiene, self quarantine and don't spread. You might spread it to your family and friends first (the closest we get ) so most of all don't be a dick. We can fight this by fighting the urge to get close to people washing hands.

Also, can you also add ""non-essential gathering in large groups must be avoided (sporting events, music events, etc.)"" Why is there a severe lack of testing centres in central and eastern parts of the country?

756,Sports,We are not perfect,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e7s7rg/we_are_not_perfect/,"19(m) just an average boy in college with a messed up life..so the other day i overheard my parent's conversation about me where basically my dad went on to rant about how i have basically achieved nothing in life while kids my age(having no financial support)have done wonders. And I've come to realize how Indian society mocks and pressurize teenagers to be at the top while completely ignoring the fact that not everyone has to be perfect and there is no shame in admitting that we are full of flaws and I'm hope people come up with things they want to say about themselves not being perfect 

Here I'll start

""I'm  19  i cant even ride a bicycle and I'm afraid to drive and i literally do not like any kind of sports""

Edit : this post is not about me complaining or whining about my parents...neither is it about seeking redressal for being a failure in life(becauselets be honest we'veheard that crap a ton of times)...Its more about accepting the way you are because here in India every judge's you ..from you looks to your talents to your abilities....its okay not to be special because a large portion of people are above you...sometimes being bad at something everyone expects you to bd good at or something that everyone is good at and your not is Okay !!"," I’m 24 and unemployed I’m 30 and my self esteem is still tied to approval from others. 20s, and I have zero ambition and drive. I'm 8 years old, I didn't get into IIT My dad stopped comparing me with others after  I was raged asf and started comparing him, his salary, our assets etc with my friends fathers and his friends.

Since that day, I’ve never felt soo good. I am 23, and scared to drive Unconditional love is a scam. Your parents,girlfriend also have certain conditions when they will love you. You have to have certain job, looks ,satisfy their expectations when they will ""love"" you. I found that recently I'm 28. By our society's standards, I'd be considered an achiever. And I fucking fought really hard for it after an extremely abusive and poor childhood. But, I have anxiety issues. People don't understand it though. 25 and anxious to drive a car after a bad accident. 😁 I have ambition but no dedication, I am extremely lazy. ""I am 49 and your dad is dumb."" I'm 31 and no idea what to do and scared about the future all the time. I am 31, have very very big aims in life. But not even moving a finger to achieve it.. I'm 26 and still in college. I'm 25, my man! Haven't driven anything ever. Here's more:

* No friends nearby. I have friends but not one single friend whom I can call up anytime.
* I have no job, I am working on my software product. So living with parents for past 1 year.
* No money. (read above point.)
* Father probably hates and sees me as a failure.
* He also thinks I'm not man enough because of next two points...
* Short for a guy. (5'4 ish)
* Skinny af.
* Never kissed or even had anything resembling a girlfriend.
* Did I miss anything? 19 hates driving,but is pressurized into doing it. There's too much pressure to be special, i mean somewhere here only you'll find someone saying ""no but you're different, you're not like everyone else"" is it that bad to be an average person ? I think it's okay to be okay. Well to all the boys... the only thing I can say having lived in a PG in Mumbai, sharing the room with 5 strangers, and surviving on a diet ofvada-pav is this

> it’s okay to be dejected,

> It’s  okay to feel like a complete failure,

> It’s okay to not find love,

> It’s okay to have disappointed parents,

> It’s okay not to have money,

> It’s okay to do a stupid job,

> It’s okay that no one gets you,

> It’s okay.

> It’s okay.


> But,

> never stop learning,

> never give up,

> never ever.



> And

> Be strong,

> Be humble,

> Be kind. Fuck society that tries to measure you, especially that of your parents. You’re you no one can compare you , but they will do that at every step.. They think it’s their job and they will be persistent and passionate about it , so you better develop some serious belief in defying them and believing in yourself instead of sucking up to their judgment.

Tell yourself this : Growing up in this sick society means developing a thick enough skin where you don’t care a shit about such opinions, and I hope you grow into a person that’s defined by you and you take pride in what you’re striving for.

Your personality, your yardstick... everything else can go get fuck itself. Its this attitude of parents that leads to teen suicides. I am sorry not trying to be rude about your parents.. but stating the facts. Can we get F's in chat? 23 completed my undergrad and pursuing CA and CS. Cleared intermediate exams for both with good score but I’m not even interested in the commerce field. 

Absolutely no idea what to do with my life and currently, just going with the flow. wtf are you supposed to achieve at 19? I've just popped in from the exchange with /r/Ireland, I hope that's ok! I felt the same at 19, dropped out of college and all that jazz. I got lucky with a job, got qualified picked up some hobbies and now I'm putting myself back through college. Take it as it comes, if you're not progressing in one aspect of life pick something else to move on in. I can't professionally move up for another year or so, so I've entered into relevant courses, started diving and learning new things.

As time goes on you'll see the similarities in how you feel and how everyone else acts, everyone is doing the same thing. Just be trying. Most parents think that millennials are dumb and are taking our nation to shit due to their smartphone and pubg addiction. But in reality it's the politicians voted by everyone including older generation. Tell him it's his genetics , all the overachievers usually have intelligent parents .... This will really piss him off I'm 24. I can't drive. I haven't even bothered to learn to cycle. You have all your life. Screw that shit. 19 is not even that old. You've technically not even started adult life. I'm 28. Bought my first car this year. Can't drive. Hate all sports. The idea of going to the gym makes me wanna cry. I’m 30 and broke Same here.

""When we were your age, we already had you. When we were your age, we had built a house of our own. When we were your age, we had a stable job. When we were your age..."", when you were my age, the country wasn't going to the dogs. When you were my age, the country wasn't going to run out of water in the next 5 years. When you were my age, things weren't as politically fragile as they are today. When you were my age, the economy hadn't collapsed from top to bottom. When you were my age a huge, unemployed youth population wasn't out either protesting for more jobs or slitting each-other's throats for one. Your time was different. Accept it and move on. I am from pakistan and faced same issue. I am 29 now and after finishing bachelors(8 years ago) I had hard time getting job like everyone else. My father used to mock me each and everyday that you are a failure and you will never achieve shit in your life. He used to say so by comparing me with one neighbor guy who got a good job as a developer. I had skills and did job which I quit after 6 months because my boss was a dick. I had been full time freelancer soon after my studies and when I started earning more than that “developer neighbor” then all the mockery stopped all of a sudden and I became their most faithful and successful son. I am currently doing my dream job outside country and living in company’s provided apparent with family. I will never forget those mockeries and will never have respect for my father which I wish I could have I sought my father's approval for the first 24 years of my life. In the last 6 months, I've been depressed and suicidal due to feeling like there was no hope for happiness in my future. 

I realised any father who put his daughter in a position to choose between her own happiness and pleasing him, is not a good parent.

Stopped giving a fuck about his approval. Took a lot of time and therapy. But it worked. Against his desires, I moved out of the country to find a future for myself and I'm struggling financially. I struggle for food. But I'm happier than I've ever been in all my life. 

Seeking validation and approval lead to no where. There will always be someone brighter, better and wealthier than you that people will compare you to. They will never be proud of what you've achieved and they don't need to. You need to be happy with yourself. And honestly that has changed my life. I never thought I could be that person.

Edit: I'm 25 and know how to drive because I got my license but never drive a car because im not confident. 19M, with a drop year (in the first year itself). Under average in studies. Physically ugly. Virgin, never kissed or hugged. Had girlfriend for 1.5years and turns out it was one sided from my side. Can't drive car but I can ride Activa. Have a really supportive bestfriend but I don't treat her right. My behaviour goes toxic when anyone proves me wrong. I feel your pain. But if you're willing to learn, find a  quiet place and a friend to help(if you can) and wake up early, like 4 - 5 am early and learn it. It should hardly take 6-7 days. I'm 21, have a job but am lazy as fuck ,very poor with my finances & afraid that I'm gonna end up alone First time huh? I hear that rant everyday, its to the point where it doesn't even affect me, i practically live with existential crisis and top that with being an introvert, no one is perfect but our society doesn't understand a simple fact that not everyone can become the top 2% in a rat race that only favours the academically superior, but we apparently can't do anything do about it so just go with the flow, pretend it's the rainy season of your life, it'll pass and the sun will shine one day, just keep on trying I'm 16....got rejected by my crush day before yesterday....self esteem is pretty low...and seeing others like me on reddit makes me genuinely happy. it's interesting as a Canadian of Indian immigrants seeing the youth of India questioning aspects of Indian culture.  It's similar to what kids of expats went through when our parents first moved away.    
Not that the globe is smaller and ideas proliferate so quickly, Indian youth are going through the same cultural revolution that we dealt with.  Still one foot firmly planted in tradition while the other desperately dragging itself to a new reality  
I only offer the advise that stay true to yourselves.  There is merit in buying into the system, but don't be defined by it.  Play music, draw pictures and do the other things that are ""frowned"" upon cuz ""ye saab se paisa nahi aiga"".   
I also understand better the pressures previous generations felt, and so it's natural for them to push on to their kids.  Treat your parents with kindness, for they know not what they do .. they too are struggling with how the world has changed before them Bro start driving using a small automatic hatchback. It's so easy to drive and also have big red 'L' stickers on your car , you can remove it once you learn how to drive. Usually people understand when they see the 'L' sticker and will give you way and won't criticize you. Wake up at 5 am and learn to drive on empty roads first, once you get the hang of it go into usual traffic. I have seen people drive with L stickers for even upto 6-8 months. But make sure you learn to drive a car before you finish college it'll be absolutely necessary. Even experienced F1 drivers would be scared shitless when they drive for the first time in Indian traffic. I screwed up and failed my car driving test and that's saying something, as our country's driving test is an absolute joke and is perhaps, one of the easiest tests out there, in this world of ours.

This happened when I was around 19 years of age (almost 5 years back). I mean, I had hopes and aspirations that I would have obtained a license asap, the moment I turned 18. Well, it sucks I suppose, for life to not turn up the way one hopes too, even if they give their darnest best to make it happen.

I guess, my neuroticism and anxiety ruined that test for me, on that fateful day. Prior to reaching the testing grounds, my instructor made me do a trial on the roads, which I did a good job of and he assured me that I'll surely pass the test as long as I maintain my cool and composure.

But, he couldn't accompany me on the grounds and instead, another instructor who had no clue of my temperament and personality came. And he didn't help things for me. For every minor mistake I made, he kept belittling me, dismissing my anxiety and nervous attitude and told me as to how I seemed to be the weakest out there, when compared to other candidates who came along with me.

And thus, I was completely demoralised and failed the test. Everyone present on the ground, were laughing at me for my ineptitude in handling the vehicle. Did not speak with anyone, on that day. I'm 23, and I still haven't learnt to drive. Just saying:  


I was afraid to drive, and have never ridden a bicycle till this summer. I got a job and was about to move to Bangalore. I knew that I had to learn it, and if I stay afraid now, I'll hate myself for this in future.  


So in a span of 2 months, I learnt how to ride a bicycle, then a scooty and a car back to back. Sometimes the motivation comes from necessity. Let me see. 23 y/o, male. 

1. cant drive any motorized vehicle.
2. cant dance, cant party
3. cant be ""social"", some dumb-fuckery by someone always flips me off
4. In a quest to learn as much as possible. so that makes me a prick
5. Dont watch movies.
6. Dont like eating.
7. Dont particularly travelling In big groups. 
8. obsessive planner, not so much on the execution side.
9. One decent relationship that lasted 6 months.

&#x200B;

note: i can and do ride bicycles and I do trek solo (started this recently) My dad made me drive when I was 19 ( now 21 ) and I got involved in 3 minor accidents and naturally developed a fear of driving cars. I can drive two wheelers fine but they still mock for not being able to drive a car. Honestly this is more because of a breakdown in communication than anything

A lot of Indian parents are great at raising and talking to their kids till they're 12-13 but seem to completely lose it after that

Its important to note that you can't control or govern your kids lives as they get older and that they still need unconditional help and support from their parents

Kids are too afraid of their parents to say no when they get forced into following some field or career and parents are too focused on the future to see what's happening with their kids in the here and the now


That being said the kid themselves isn't blameless.. A lot of bright minded smart kids just lose the will to study/work/perform... And there is little their teachers or parents can do to understand if there is no communication.


As for you OP... If you have a clear idea of what you wanna do in life then let your parents know about it... Let them understand that you have a goal that you're working towards.. An aim that you want to achieve

They may be bullheaded about it but they still want the best for you.. Using my throwaway porn account because I don't want my irl friends to find out about his, ever.

20, Final year of BCA. Since I'm a failure (not engineer), My school friends consider me a failure and try really hard to hide that because that don't want to hurt me (Or maybe I'm insecure, Idk)    

* I still live with my parents, and I regret not living out on my own at least once every week.
* I know I'm not stupid (I'm always one of the first ones to build up logic for a program, I'm good at few things) but I have never achieved anything in my life, used to score \~50% in schools and hence have trouble with my self image in this aspect (If I'm smart who just sucks at studies or if I'm dumb and just pretending to be smart).
* Current college is shitty as fuck, I have grown to hate this city because I want to live away from it.     
* My dressing sense sucks, but I try to mask it with an ""I don't care what I wear"" attitude     
* I'm supposed to be preparing for MCA, which, if done from good college, Is the only way I can start earning. I have studied nothing in last 5 days, And my MCA entrance is 3 months away. I had told my Pune friends that I'll be visiting them around 18th of December, but now I'm having second thoughts because of not studying. I'm not prepared at all for this, I feel like I'm gonna be a fuckup. and the worst part of this is I'm not even trying to change things.
* I have a gaming problem, when I'm left with games, I stop prioritizing things, and play it till everything else is collapsed... Last time I spiraled out on my gaming thing, I ended up scoring really bad for my 12th exams (Hence didn't take engineering)  
* I'm really self critical, self conscious and a self loather (Not proud of it). There is something wrong with me, psychologically, But I don't know what. Parents won't understand what therapy is (Typical ""you're not crazy, try going out more"" mentality, I don't blame them for it). I have planned to get therapy with my own money once I start earning, Which won't be anytime soon.
* I know I won't do it. but I passively think that if I don't settle down by 25 (or atleast start to settle down), I will kill myself  (Again, I won't do it. I have felt suicidal twice in my life, and didn't even try to harm myself those two times.)

I don't even know why I'm posting this here, I guess I just need to vent. 19 , Didn't get into IIT even after taking drop, have zero friends and no accomplishments, Never had a GF , total waste of parents money Dude that pressure will always be there, irrespective of your age. Today it is abt your studies, tommorow it will be abt job, then about marriage and kids. 
I stood up to my dad only after engineering, i finally got the balls to say that i want to do business and not want to work in a MNC.
He listened to me for the first time after that full blown argument.
Now he encourages(read pressure) me to expand my business 😅 Turned 22 today, absolutely no direction in life. Have no idea what I really like doing. Most of us deal with this on a daily basis, correct me if I’m wrong. We could all use a hug right now. 
But only thing that keeps me going is no matter how hard or shitty a day gets, it doesn’t last more than 24 hours. I feel slightly better knowing that. Hopefully this changes the way you perceive things. Well I'm a teacher wage about 3000 RS per month 22 year old, lazy but hard working , have a dream of becoming an scientist or programmer but dream crushed by the same people The comparisons to other people of your age is normal and everyone has faced this in their life. Note that, I am saying everyone has faced this doesn't mean that it is right and in the contrary, it is detrimental on the mindset of how we are brought up. The fact is that after our parents do this comparison, some people don't give a damn after a certain age but some people still end up comapring themselves with their peers. 

Yep, nobody is perfect but we have to do something meaningful in the world to earn our living, etc. How do you want to earn your living and lead your life should be up to you and you alone, IMHO. If it comes down to something down something along the lines of '""Sharmaji Kya sochenge?""To kahiye sharmaji khud ke baare me soch lein, hum apna dekh lenge.' The way you wrote your post. It seems you stopped before you even started. 


You really are not perfect are you comrade I'm 36 and can't afford a car. Forget driving anything. >I'm  19  i cant even ride a bicycle and I'm afraid to drive and i literally do not like any kind of sports

That's my description. Except I'm 22 Oh man that line 19 and can't ride a bicycle hit me. I am 20 i wasn't able to ride bicycle but few months back i made up my mind that i will learn after a week i was able to ride a little bit now i can ride a motorbike (not perfect ) . And also i have started focusing on my life i learned c , python and have started focusing on study . I would also like to mention i flunked in maths in 12 so i would like to say its never too late to change. 23, graduated last year, was working at a job I'd landed through campus placements.
But quit, because, big dreams, preparing for a very unpredictable exam with no back-ups whatsoever.  
No idea what's going to happen if my plan falls apart. Im 19 and I haven’t spoken to a girl in over 7 months I'm 27 and I'm alone. I'm 19 and I can't speak to someone(immediately) new especially if they are girls or someone of greater my age! I'm 20 and feel you. Financial freedom will get you out of misery. Try doing things that can get you some money here and there. Stock trading and shit. Once you start making enough on the side to help with some expenses at home meanwhile you do stuff for yourself nobody will say shit. I honestly feel like people need to know this one trick. It is a shame that you feel that way. Unfortunately Indian parents have a tendency to push their own fragile ego and aspirations on their kids. There is absolutely nothing wrong with you and don't let the things that your parents say get inside of your head. Get a job, become financially independent and move out. Just do not continue to engage in the toxicity of your parents otherwise things will only become worse for you. I am around 40. I moved to Europe decades ago for IT work, which I am still doing. A lot of my friends in India, some didn't even finish school, are now vastly better off that me financially. Two owns businesses and employs 50+ people. At least 6 have amassed so much wealth (land, properties) that they could retire any day they want. I have 20 years left on my mortgage here.

/I am not complaining though, I have a very good life. I'm 26 and I can't drive (but I'm gonna get back to practice soon). Graduated with an engineering degree at 22 from a national top 10 school, but working hard to re-enrol in a good college so I can finally study things I've always wanted to. Have a lean built but never made a serious effort to get a buff physique as I always found gyms expensive. Promised myself I will get over my discomfort and go to the gym every day when I get into college (and finally have time again). 20. Failed 2nd year of med school, taking a break for one year. Dad says he's ashamed of me and wouldn't talk to me. I've been sent to another city because he can't stand seeing my face, or hearing my voice. I can't talk to people my own age or people in general for that matter, even for small talk. I'm overweight. I'm 17 and supposed to crack JEE but don't know shit about solving those kind of problems, JEE starts on 8 Jan, fml 22 and can't drive because I hit my face on an iron fence while learning. Safe to say I'm perpetually petrified of vehicles and fences. 

Also intrusive thoughts. Does anyone else deal with thoughts that'd lead to brutal death while driving without anything even happening or is it just me lol I’m 31 and never been in a real romantic relationship. Wtf is wrong with me. The worst thing is the disappointment more than unemployment you see on the other fucking faces that we've let them down voluntarily & suddenly we become the bad guy 
Fuck this society I'm in my 3rd year of engineering. I feel like a complete shit. My parents are supportive of my decisions, but I give up things when the going gets tough for example Competitive coding and divert myself with porn or reddit.  

I do not have a routine. I lack consistency and discipline. But I want to get rid of this lethargic feeling that I get. Man... I'm loosing control over my actions. Any advise would be appreciated kind Randians. i choose Non medical but i dont wanna join IIT 20s, I fell from my scooter once, it wasn't a big fall neither was it very serious but couldn't bring myself to drive a two wheeler again. Learnt to drive my car, once i couldn't start my car on time after the green light and i don't need to explain the commotion i created at that time, which scared me a lot and im too scared to drive now. Also my left leg feels like it will fall off in pain due to me controlling the clutch in heavy bangalore traffic. So im a lazy and untalented according to my parents. Lol ok parents, im your child who has your genes

also using public transport is better for the Environment Exams after two days and I haven't completed anything properly. I am 18 and I have zero self confidence and even though I have been a performer before, now I am just really scared of going on stage and its funny because in my life  all I wanted was to be on a stage performing.

p.s. I am a trained dancer. 28 still studying .. This website is weird AF.

\> I'm  19  i cant even ride a bicycle and I'm afraid to drive and i literally do not like any kind of sports

Sports? Never knew Indian parents gave two shits about sports. Play anything, you will get flying HC Verma on your face [deleted] Indians parents are one of the worst in the world. I am 1.6lpm guy but my failure  count is much more than  success count . Sure, society does put pressure but don't use the anti-thesis to just be lazy. Dream, work for them, else life is just pointless void without real higher purpose anyway. Bro. Just find out what you really like and work towards it. It might be against their will but that's how you can give an answer to them and to the society. 20 and still confused if I want to become a software engineer or a musician. I mean I love both but I'm not very good in either of them. :( Rather than think about what you are not good at, think about what you like and are good at or can be good at.
You don’t judge a horse by how fast it swims and a fish by how fast it runs.

If you are not good at studies, maybe you like cooking, or art, or sports, or gardening etc.

Find your passion...
Don’t let a negative opinion define you. This is all a direct result of Capitalism tbh. I'm n years old, and I can't do a lot of things - but unlike the losers who don't want to put in the effort to be able to do those things, I genuinely want to improve, and am working toward being what I expect myself to be, instead of whining about it on the internet. In the mid-20s. Unemployed for over a year. No social life anymore. Skinny, tall and bald. Very anxious about everything. I'm good at driving, just anxious. Failed driving test. 23 and hate myself to the core. I had social anxiety so talking to others really makes me nervous. I am so perfectly imperfect. I'm in my late twenties and I'm rediscovering life after nearly a decade of depression.

I'm still depressed, of course, but I don't have to let that define me, or dictate who I am or my actions. I've been depressed so long that my childhood memories seem like they happened to someone else. Like I was an observer to my own childhood.

But eventually the clouds will clear, even if it seems impossible. We will never be perfect, but we will bear our crosses and carry on. Because that's life. Suffering, peppered with moments of joy, pain, heartbreak, melancholy, and loneliness.

You'll be alright. We all will be. Its perfectly fine to be self-aware and being comfortable with yourself. But more importantly its necessary to try and fail rather than just being a silent observer and judging other's opinions. If you have anything that keeps you awake at night, you must pursue that coz it's the effort that counts more than success usually. I dont like any sports thats just okay. But ARE YOU AN ENGINEER ? Abey fuck same Logged in to tell you this. I learnt to cycle at age 28 and now I often bike 30 kms to work. Hang in there dude, you'll get there.! The way you wrote your post. It seems you stopped before you even started. 


You weren't joking when you said you weren't perfect comrade I am 21, I'm scared to learn to drive a car. I also sometimes feel like I've wasted myself academically to the point that there's no climbing back up for me. I also put off seeing a psychologist cause I feel anxious to even go lol I moved to Canada when I was 22 and long story short, I fucked some things up and came back to India 2 years later. Now I'm 25, battling depression, still unemployed but trying my best, listening to parents' whining almost every Sunday.

So, you're good! I am 23, and not able to drive a bike, recently learnt to ride scooty on street. I am graduated and got a decent job with decent pay. Yet, so doubts that not able to interact and have a deep conversation with anyone easily. Lonely af. Still life is beautiful. I have been a "" Sharma ji ka beta"" Kinda guy in whole life. So can't even complain. :). I like how OP is talking about accepting ones faults while the comments are filled with suggestions on how to fix that fault. 

Thanks for proving his point? I'm 30, fat(29 BMI) and haven't gotten promoted in a looooong time! I am 21 and i cant talk to girls. Yea the irony being ( in relation to the post) I know what iam doing but it ain’t progressing. 

Fingers crossed As someone who's disabled and struggles with mental health, I've had a lot of other things happen in my life that has made me feel in similar ways. 

&#x200B;

I have developed a very anticapitalist mindset as a result. Fucking wholesome this thread. I'm 26, graduated in hotel management, decided not to pursue the career, did MBA in marketing didn't wanted to do field work, did digital marketing course, didn't liked it, so here i am, working in a KPO as a fresher, on minimum wages, clueless of what I am going to do next.... Oh and did I tell u that I am socially awkward and a virgin who never had a girlfriend, yeah that and I sometimes hope for an alien invasion so that my society's focus diverts from me! I'm 19 (M)

First year at IIT. 

Severe body dysmorphia that I tell no one about. 

An ldr that I'm desperately invested in. 

No friends in college. 

Read incel websites and find myself agreeing with bits and pieces of it. Feel terrible immediately afterwards. We all Drew a tangent to the op conversation. I have heard countless stories of your loved ones comparing you to someone else. I feel so hopeless for such loved ones of mine they have spent all of their life comparing crying and living to fit in the society. “You have to this to make good name” “what will society think” “will you go marry a girl pf different caste and make us look like we raised a fool” The core message is *stop living for people and society start living for yourself*. I hope to get this in my grand pa’s head someday! You just copied my situation, although I'm 18, not 19. Guess some things about boomers never change. You are not trying to achieve and like to stay remain where you are so, not taking any chance to do new thing. Thats great. People should accept you. You are normal. Don't listen other. Do what you want. I dropped out for 3 years and did nothing with that time Seeing all the people who are scared to drive I think you could also blame Indian roads and driving practices. I too hate driving because I have a terrible attention span. But it's doable as long as you take enough caution. I am trying to loose weight since 2006, I am 26 😢 The other day I saw fuckin rickshaws drive on the footpath , ofc now I'm scared to drive I'm 19 and I'm in college and I just feel numb most of the time and I'm lacking self esteem and have zero ambition in life. I don't know how I'm gonna get through this but I'm going to fucking get out of this shitty state. That’s just bad parenting - showing that your parents aren’t perfect either :) I'm 18, and feel isolated in most social situations. The few people I am close with to the point where this isn't a factor are toxic and make me a worse version of myself. I want to make better, more meaningful relationships but my low self-confidence and insufficient social aptitude make it difficult.

&#x200B;

:') I am 22, overweight, and procrastinate alot I am 17 and very socially awkward. I have trouble talking with strangers and making new friends. I am 18 and just want to die. I'm 19 and I forget to take towel with me to the shower . Hi maybe i can advise u on what u can do. Can i ? I'm 20, I've given NEET 2 times and I haven't got in. *""The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.""* --Mahatma Gandhi Okay guys, I will start practicing driving yet again this week.. I've been neglecting this due to the anxiety of driving a car after I near drove my car into a marsh People who complain about a generation forget who raised them. Expectation is a two way street. I'm 19 and I've lost interest in life. Don't give a fuck about anything, not even my parents. I haven't cried properly in 4 years thanks to extreme bullying and shaming in high school. Don't get me wrong , I love life. Suicide is the last thing i will ever think about. But , I just want to have more confidence  in myself. I'm completely emotionless, have 0 interest in life in any aspect. I don't play any game more than 3 minutes, don't read a book or a topic more than 2 lines and give up on a task even before I start.  I just want to feel an emotion. that'd be good. Hello there. Well hate to break it to you, but you are not even at the worst stage of your life. Soon in a few years you'll be pressured to get married. And yes arranged. And if you still don't have a job? Be ready to face the wrath of your parents. Yeah Indian society. I mean of course they mean well but this isn't the way. Man sometimes i think what if I become scientist or programmer should I'd be happy I am 21, too chickenshit to drive or ride a bike, thinking about dropping out of post grad I am 23 and I was super scared to drive in India. While my friends had their licenses and driving their cars, I used sit in the back seat. It's only when I moved abroad I learnt how to drive. Oh and I also dont know how to ride a bicycle, bike or even swim."" I'm 19 too and I can't think anything else other than just killing myself. I'm 29 and I've not saved my first million ₹ yet. 22. IIT graduate. Didn't learn a thing about Engineering. No idea what to do with my life. I can relate, buddy. 
Indian parents expect their children to be like satya nadela or Bill gates. 
When we tell them that we can't, they come up with bullshit stuff like - 'look at that guy, he had nothing and now he is -insert a high level title-' 
Or  ' We sacrificed so much for you, at least do this or that' I am 23 (M). Here are some of my flaws/failures:

1. I didn't complete a B.Tech. from IIT or a B.Sc. from St. Stephen's. I could never sort out my priorities as a teenager so I ended up attending a ""decent-ish"" DU college instead. 

2. I do not work for McKinsey, Bain, BCG, Amazon, or Google. My family believes that I am competent enough to reach great heights, and I try my best to make them proud, but so far my path has only been full of disappointment.

3. My girlfriend, whom I wanted to spend the rest of my life with, grew uncertain about the future of our relationship so I ended things on a bitter note. In hindsight, maybe I couldn't handle all the stress and acted rather impulsively. I still think about how I could've done better in that situation.

4. I've got no real friends whom I can depend upon to always have my back. There are plenty of friends, but no one who will sit with me and genuinely inquire about my problems. I guess I might've taken the nicest people that came into my life for granted, and now it's impossible to completely fix that even through honest apologies.


It sucks to have to deal with all this, but I've somehow learnt to find happiness in the small things. More importantly, I choose to focus on becoming a better version of myself everyday and not get too affected by my past. Maybe, there is a bigger plan that's laid out for me and I just can't see it yet? Who knows... 25 M, cant drive, extremely overweight(borderline obese), no zero ambition or drive for anything in life. Constant complainer and down in the dumps dummy Hey dude I feel like I've done nothing many times - especially when I perform lower than what others expect (which is your case I believe).

If thinking that ""Indian society is shit and makes you feel shittier"" makes you feel better, be it. Sometimes having a certain opinion about something can make us fell better. 

However, you can't hate on your parents, or as a matter of fact, any blood relation always. I try to convince myself by thinking that most Indian parents care more than parents in other cultures do. It has its advantages and disadvantages. I'm sure we do get a lot more moral support sometimes (not all) than others. But sometimes over expectations leads to such situations.

Edit: corrected spelling [deleted] My friend is 30 years old at this moment.
He has never driven a motorcycle in his entire life so far.

757,Sports,How can you outrun Usain Bolt? Get yourself some buffalos | Life and style,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2020/feb/19/how-can-you-outrun-usain-bolt-get-yourself-some-buffalos,," Even  Srinivasa gowda acknowledged  the same and said his focus is on Kambala not on sprint . 

Its  the social media that hyped the achievement . Even politicians fron either side of the aisle joind the fake news .

Haterd towards anything is too strong in sub. Even on reddit, I came across some ignorant fools who thought ""with proper training, our Usain Bolt can bring gold in Olympic"".

Indian people have zero understanding of sports outside of cricket. All they can do is make fool of themselves. Even a state-level athlete can beat this guy in a trial session.

This guy could have been a Usain Bolt if we had proper sports infrastructure to train such guys from their teenage age. [removed] get two stampeding buffaloes to pull you sliding through the mud Get a Auto rickshaw, you can outrun Light it self."

760,Sports,Why are there no indian cheerleaders??,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/es9hc2/why_are_there_no_indian_cheerleaders/,"This is a serious question. Ive typed indian cheerleaders on youtube, google, google images, etc and literally all of the results are of european girls. 

In IPL, ALL of them are european girls. 

Culture cant be the only reason. I mean in such a huge population, there should be some that are open enough to perform routines. 

Is it regarding attractiveness? Theres no shortage of bombshells in india, especially given the population. I would really love our beautiful brown women to take up this sport. Its a well respected sport in many developed countries.

I seriously dont get it lol. Why bring girls all the way from europe and north america?

Same thing with bollywood and the background dancers but there are some indian dancers still in there."," Cheerleading is not a recognised sporting activity India. In fact, it's not very popular outside of the States. While growing in popularity in some western countries, competitive cheerleading is not attached to a lot of sporting events. So, not a lot of what would be called actual cheerleaders would not be found in India. And for IPL, the so called cheerleading was nothing but a commercial eye candy spectacle. Want more people showing up to fill stands, give Indian men white women in skirts to look at. CSK used to have Indian cheerleaders. They even had a guy cheerleader. If I remember correctly there was also something about the colour of our skin. We discriminate a lot (which is also why we don’t see any Latina/Arab or black cheerleaders) Amit Malviya, Tejinder Bugga, Payal Rohatgi would be amazing as cheerleaders They're either gonna get raped, groped, cat called, slut-shamed or all together.

Our society is happier oppressing people, human rights & basic human decency and all, are unimportant.

Also,

""Log kya kahenge""
""Aise kapde pehene to mard kya karega?"" I think its the same reason why we don't have strip clubs. Our society looks down on it because its not pure or its against godliness all that stuff. Must be something about indian mentality. Cheerleading is probably down there with lap dancing and mujhra dancing. People think it's a low job that doesn't deserve any respect. Until this changes then you probably wont see indian cheerleaders on google youtube etc. Its really sad as there is nothing wrong with this type of work. CSK, KKR and the defunct PWI have Indian cheerlearders donning traditional clothes. Google Images should give you some pics! I guess when IPL started, Lalit Modi and the powers at that time decided to import the cheerleaders to get more eyeballs in, and that trend has continued. This is what keeps you up at night?"
761,Sports,How should I feel?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fn5zmp/how_should_i_feel/,"How should I feel that I'm privileged? I'm 25, earning 60k, and it's not that I'm dumb or something but sometimes I feel how to feel. My dad's a government officer, mid-fifties, earns more than a lac. He's the most hard working and disciplined person I have ever seen. He's in the government since his early twenties. He's just 3 years away from retirement. He loves reading and love making contacts. My mom's a housewife(mid-forties or late forties, lol I don't know her date of birth), she's sweet, lovely, caring and love making people happy. My sibling is the best. He's earning okay. My parents have raised me well. I'm glad I grew up in the nineties, so I developed a lot of interest in sports and played a lot of them at competitive levels. I had a profound interest in video games and computers. My dad bought a one in the early 2000s I guess, with Windows 95 on it. He used it for typing, there was something FoxPro thing I don't exactly remember he used to do. Then most of my 2000s went playing with friends, games, school, etc. It was real fun, to be honest. I cherish those memories, a lot. College was not so good, but okay kinda. I realized a hell lot in college, not the studies haha but a lot about me. I'm not on Facebook and Instagram, quit them already. In the past year, I've developed a rigorous thinking about work and how not to throw away your life. It's really turning good for me. I follow Angel co-founder Naval and like him a lot. He's a good man. All in all, I have my interests or niche that I follow. It's good to not be mainstream sometimes. I don't have a goal. The only thing I know is to work hard, improve my skills and learn continuously. I joke at people who settle down and say learning stops when you get old. I call bullshit. 

But I don't know how should I feel? Being in a country with people who are deprived of such things. Should I feel guilty or thankful? I would think, if I was born in a poor family, I would've been living a mediocre life, with struggling to survive. I think when I reach 30, I will be financially independent. Only dependencies I want are my parents and sibling. No external sources like marriage or some other shit.  They raised me right, now it will be my turn to be with them at old age. 

Thanks for reading."," You seem like a balanced person, someone I would enjoy having a drink with. 

I think the answer to your question is clear - do as much as you can to bring privilege, education and opportunity to those that don't have those things. 

Or perhaps make as much money as possible, and live your life doing the things you enjoy. I'm guessing your thought process would naturally lead you to the former option in any event. When do you plan to marry and get settled?"

Now, it looks like the muscles near my shin area keeps on hurting after I run or put pressure on my legs(by jumping or running). It's been around a year and I don't think this injury is going to heal itself now. I've been to different doctors but no one knew shit. Gave me useless medicines, xrays and even a fucking MRI that cost me a fortune. I'm hopeless at this point and don't know what to do.

763,Sports,Why isn’t scholastic wrestling not a part of extra curriculum in Indian Schools despite wrestling being a popular sport in Indian culture?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dnq7jf/why_isnt_scholastic_wrestling_not_a_part_of_extra/,"Wrestling or kushti in hindi seems to be one of the most popular indian sports and martial art of India. The history of Akharas makes it look like India really is into wrestling. So much that often time whenever a normal indian fights you can see him using a crude style of wrestling.

But despite all the cultural history wrestling is not a sport ever present in Indian schools while American schools all have a good wrestling team with them.

This seems like a result of bad mentality among Indians that sports are a waste of time and study is everything that matters.

And most parents are so overprotective that they wouldn’t allow their ward to train in fear of him being hurt or injured?"," Because kushti is very limited to parts of North India, and it's not very common anywhere else.  Sure, if it's popular in a locality, they should promote it there but I don't see kids in Mizoram being as excited about it as Punjab. I can think of two reasons:

1) In india entrance tests are pretty much the key to higher education and career prospects, so there is no point in spending time on sports
2) Not all colleges give admission based on sports quota, unlike western colleges where a number of athletes go to to colleges based on sports scholarship Infrastructure and lack of coaches. Otherwise it is just shortsightedness of the education-focused country. Because many prefer taikwondo or karate."
764,Sports,60 thousand fans turned up today to support the Indian football team against Bangladesh.,https://i.redd.it/pkvfka0smqs31.jpg,," we should have won against bangladesh .. draw is a tad disappointing. YBK is a great venue to play for the country Isn't this at Salt Lake Stadium? Indians started loving cricket after 83 win... Maybe if the current team could win something big people would go crazy... I truly believe in the next 4-5 years India is going to be a competent side I like the banner with Mohammedan Sporting, Mohun Bagan and East Bengal. Let's not forget the originals! I was on my way to a late meeting before the match, and EM Bypass that connects the stadium was jam packed with cars and bikes, with Indian flags all over, Flying high. Some of them wore cricket jerseys as well lol but the passion in my city for football is crazy and as a fan I love it. Imagine playing in a world class stadium with jam packed audience chanting football slogans and appreciating every forward pass you make, It feels like home. I love the fact that so many people turned up for the game. Sad that we didn't win but absolutely love the support that was shown to the team. Hey I can see myself!! My small rant about the situation of football in our country: 

You need development from basic stage, And one of the biggest drawbacks for India is the weather then you have diet issues and no proper scouting and organizational structure. I can share a small story that might interest some of you  

I come from a small town surrounded by many Adivashi colonies, During my schooling I was an active football player and I even played inter divisional football for the South Eastern Railways, That time I used to see some Adivashi folks joining us in training and were of the same age but much stronger core to us ( Credit to their hard work and natural diet ), Some of them used to drive a van or rickshaw for the whole day in that summer heat and then came to practice, We still had a hard time beating them, Heck when after 70 mins we looked drained they ran like arrows Over the time as we grew priorities for them changed , I leaned for most they had to earn in order to even put food on the table. I was privileged enough to be able to play but not to pursue,  education doesn't exactly go well with sports and Indian parents in our country, Our coach tried his best to raise awareness and setup small funds from the local shops but in a small town there's only so much you can do, People like these gets lost in the never ending rat race of survival in our country and talents don't get a platform or a chance to prove themselves or gets exposure to actually do anything, be it in training or development. 

We still do not have mentality to attend or endure whole season of football, Let alone the I League. Community Shield etc. ISL is only for a short period of time and tbf it's doing more wrong than good, but still the initiative is good, as no one else fucking bothers.

I still hope one day indian kids will dream of playing football for our country / clubs abroad and people will get behind their players like they do for cricket now.

Edit: retarded typos. A sight to see.. I’d pay to watch this ... tired of paying big bucks to watch euro friendlies. Football is slowly picking up pace in India. With so many young kids attracted to club football in Europe and better focus on training facilities, India will slowly improve its standing. But it's still a long way to go, maybe 10-15 years before we get to the top 50 rankings. ...and got disappointed. A win would've been the true appreciation for the people present.. Nevertheless, good show! Loved the giant poster consisting portrait of 3 players wearing East Bengal FC, Mohonbagan FC, Mohammedan SC jerseys standing in a huddle.. ,😍 This is proud for any nation, for this kind of fan following. Yuba bharati kirangan 🧡 U/manjit2990 did u watch it or to maybe support the BD team against India? ^(/s) The mecca of Indian Football.. people in Calcutta share an equal passion for Football and Cricket. just wish t'was the same in the whole country I'm from Bangalore and support BFC. In the initial seasons, the much talked about West Block Blues held up a banner,that is still held up at major games today. That message is all inclusive and is ever more important now.

""The road is long, but the belief is everything. Stand up for Indian football.""

Never been so proud to see a packed stadium for our games. Unpopular opinion: Team performs better without Chettri.  [SC: We couldn't deliver a performance to match the atmosphere at the Salt Lake last night, and the dressing room is very disappointed about it. We couldn’t capitalise on the chances we got,but this is a process on the pitch and in the stands. You turned up, we'll keep attempting to.](https://twitter.com/chetrisunil11/status/1184295678626779137) Do the people on seats under the big flag get to see the match? Or are those seats empty? 60, 000 there, yet still no comments here. +1 Koi video dikhao bc Amazing Spectacle Keep it up Good news! Love it :) Cuz there are too many of us to go around Soo much support. Yet internationally so behind. 

My take: Sporting culture is minimal. No places to casually play. Courts, grounds, spaces are accessible for the  rich only.  Developed parks have the infuriating ""Park mein football aur ball sports khelna mana hai"" (football and ball sports not allowed).  I have seen people stopped for playing catch with a tennis ball. ""band karo ye!"" ""park ka satyanaash kar diya hai!"" (stop this. Have spoiled the park)

Development, training, diet are obviously important. But loads of countries ahead of india in football have these problems. There definitely seems support for Soccer in India. How has it not translated to something like cricket. This is kolkata we are talking about the turnout is expected. I think crickets popularity will be over within 2 decades because the game is too long as well as boring because it is almost entirely dominated by our country now. And sports like football will rise in popularity but i am not sure if sports will ever be as popular as west in our country because we never had a sports culture in the first place and it is introduced at a time when video games are rising in popularity , and second thing is most of these outdoor sports originated in the west where temperature is cold but in the scorching heat of india i dont know how comfortable it is to play these sports thats why i believe sports like kabaddi are better suited for indian environment and might become popular once again someday or some new indoor sport might be created . JAI HIND Glad that football is picking up in India, but I feel like instead of organising matches in cricket stadiums building more quality football only stadiums and keeping matches there will really be a huge boost to the game here. More fan come to see Kerala blasters play Stop hyping this dumpster team. Indian football is corrupt and will take a 1000 years to even qualify for the world cup. They can't even defeat Bangladesh.. pathetic Virat ne kaisa perform kia? :) Feels like a slutty click bait title. 60k people went to see an interesting match. Not necessarily to “support” India [removed] Can someone explain how Qatar couldn't beat us in their own backyard? Was it the under 14 women team or something that were playing against us that day? Maybe in disguise? [deleted]"

It's like the Ikea of sportswear/clothing. Decathlon near my home organise events, from small walks for a cause to random cycling. Though a small town, it often has active participation of locals. 

Also, their staff are directly involved in these training activites, kinda makes the whole experience great. More than a shop, it gives a socialising platform in sports field. Thank you Decathlon, for once you are making arrogant sportswear makers like Nike, Adidas, Puma, Asics, NB nervous.  These people have made their products like 50 -100 % more expensive in India as compared to the west.  Largely making common products out of reach for the middle class.  

Nike shoes which are just common wear in the west is overpriced here and is supposed to be a fashion statement. So much so that when NRI travel to India they bring shoes as gifts to please my family. 

For context: A 100 $ Asics running shoe is  Rs14000 in India. What kind of business model is this? I'm going to decathlon for sure TIL Decathlon is French [deleted] Decalathon replaced my 4 month old shoes under warranty. :) 

Fuk u Adidas I don't know of anyone's been to decathlon's in Bangalore but somehow in all of them, the helper staff seem like well off upper middle class people in their 20s, you can tell from the way they speak and dress, their English is like those South Bombay kids. I have even seen foreigners work as staff. This is very weird because you don't see people who are well off doing jobs that are considered menial by a lot of people. Does decathlon pay really well or something. Reduced visits to Decathlon, because I end up spending more than I need to. The assortment is so good and the quality is first class. I just live their shop man so big and they let you try and play with things. Even the employees at store are so friendly and helpful. I wish more brands adopt this style, I'm hopping IKEA has similar experience. 

The store in thane had very friendly environment, they trusted customers and I've seen so many times people shoplifting so they had to start tagging and deploying security at stores. That's just sad. 

These Adidas, Nike, puma deserve this. Decathlon cares about sports more than money-making... I fucking love Decathlon. Amazing quality stuff at great prices. I just wish they make a shopping app. Or at least do something w their website. It's really buggy or something Decathlon, The Hamley's for Adults What's the difference between their dry, dry+ and dry+ breathe running t shirts? I heard great things about them from my buddies (so their word of mouth advertising seems to be working well) - will have to visit one day. it is pronounced ""di-ka-thlo"" if anyone is interested I just love Decathlon for their product quality and excellent pricing. It's my go to shop for shoes clothes and basic sport goods. 

I have met many disabled employees at the Pune store (and I'm sure they proactively encourage and hire) which really improves their brand image in front of me. Most of their staff is super young so kudos to them for employing out country's young guns. 

Their staff is excellently trained and helps you get the best item possible. Kids cycling and playing in store brings a smile to my face. 

If anyone from Decathlon is reading this - Thank you for coming to India! :) I love my decathlon. You can get some nice quality stuff for cheap. the store design is one of the best aspect of them. Explore all you want and buy what you like no interference from staff unless you need it This is really popular in hyderabad This is the place where I end up buying shit I don't need. Nike, Adidas, Puma etc. are expensive just because they want to recover their huge investments in marketing Do they happen to sell them online?? I'm hearing about this brand for the first time 😅 Decathlon is my prefferd showroom to buy shoes, pant & physical fitness related things This should be an obvious middle finger in the faces of Nike and other over expensive brands. Decathlon stuff is amazing value for money. Somewhere I read this ""Decathlon is Hamleys for adults"" Shower thought: Decathlon is basically Hamleys for adults. I love everything about them but hate their trail rooms. Everything is perfect there but why they have coffin like squeezy trail rooms? Mostly i have seen people who are into sport there 5:10-6 ft easily, i wonder how they manage in their. I am 5:9 and i find it really difficult to especially for bottom wears. I love Decathlon.
I also only buy running/cross-training shoes (or such critical gear) only from nike(or high quality brands).
It may make little to no difference where your shorts or t-shirts are from, but if you're an active runner/player it's important to invest in the right pair of shoes or equipment.
Sure Decathlon is amazingly affordable, while nike is exorbitantly overpriced, but there are clear and significant reasons to also get nike.
Foot calluses or even alignment and stride, or injuries are difficult to avoid if you're hitting the pavement or the treadmill for 10km 3 times a week. If you can reduce probability by even 10%, the high price is worth it. After they opened in Chennai I stopped bothering with the other brands, much more affordable imo.

769,Sports,Hotstar video quality is total crap,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e006q5/hotstar_video_quality_is_total_crap/,"I've got a 100mbps connection which plays Netflix, Prime YouTube at full hd or even 4k (YouTube only) absolutely fine. But Hotstar is a completely different animal. 

First of all, it never remembers your video setting. No matter what you do, new videos will start at auto resolution which is probably 480p or lower. It never gets better like Netflix does, no auto scaling. The quality remains 480p. But then there's an override setting. You can select high and it will scale to full hd. But only for some titles.

For many titles, the quality gets stuck to 480p no matter what you do, no setting can override this. You can skip, pause but nothing works. 

So, is this problem only with me, or does anyone else see this kind of problems in their phone?

App: Hotstar Android
Phone: Samsung Note 9

I don't know. It kind of looks as if Hotstar is trying to save bandwidth costs. Out of all the major streaming apps, Hotstar is the only one without hdr, and it's video bandwidth is already pretty less (pixelations). But now it seems that they have decided to remind the customers - you get what you pay for. Only if Disney wasn't pumping all the latest shows there, I'd have switched away long time ago."," Imagine having to watch F1 on that. Low bitrate

This is why people pirate

They need to upgrade their hardware No, it's not just you. Hotstar's steaming quality is absolute shit. Makes me really appreciate Netflix. Those guys are miles ahead of everyone else when it comes to their streaming tech. Hotstar has shit content if u ignore HOOQ HBO. 

You can directly but HOOQ subscription btw I feel this. Cunts have the worst streaming platform. YT/Netflix streams 1080p smoothly but hotstar still buffers at 480p. As someone who follows EPL, I really wish there was an alternate option to Hotstar! Why is nobody talking about the forced cropping to 16:9 on every Hollywood movie? This shit sucks. Pay for hotstar and pirate HD if you feel bad about pirating. You've done your part, and avoided the shitty quality and logo that exists for fuck-what reason. 

And the content discovery is so shit. I have to check just watch.in to see what available. The top movies on my screen has The Hunt for Osama bin laden for the last 6 months. Is this a top movie? Who the fuck is watching this? It's a cheap documentary for fuck's sake. I have no problems streaming Hotstar on my Android TV, but on other devices like my phone and laptop, it absolutely sucks. And then broadcasters complain about piracy It works well on tv but yeah on android its the worst ,same thing for amazon prime Quality is good on computer but on Android it sucks...I sent them an email regarding this but no one replied. Even on HD setting, quality is worse (I was watching live cricket match at that time and it was 3-4 months back). And I thought they are providing low quality to the viewers without subscription so I took the sports pack but quality was still poor. Their iPad UI is equally shit. No PiP mode. Can't see the time/date while playing video. But their Mahabarath does not have Subs 😤 🙁 😭 It’s very apparent in darker scenes and you can literally see the pixelation in the areas with shadows. Also they somehow manage to fuck up the color and white balance. I mean the blacks appear dark grayish for some reason. 

Unfortunately it’s the only source for many classic HBO shows so I kind of live with it. Mate it's what you get for what you pay! Welcome to India....Oh wait, you're Indian...you know the drill! Their web UI isn't that good either. Do you guys get irritated by how, when autoplaying the next episode, the video player would exit from full screen mode. Sucks in android but decent on PC.
I got is only for occasionally watching live sports, and even then sometimes it's service is down for live sports like PL, tennis.
Content wise Netflix is the king(atleast for English content) [deleted] I use Hotstar everyday. My video quality always remains on high and I get really good quality. This is on the desktop site though, I never use the app. I feel like Hotstar's quality varies with shows and streams. Whenever I am watching a game or watching an English TV show the quality varies from trash to garbage. But whenever my mom starts watching her Indian TV shows, it plays at the highest possible quality without any hiccup. Hotstar is crap!

FTFY I doubt thats even 480p. Probably 360p at max. It also has the worst compression I have ever seen on an OTT platform. The blacks get absolutely crushed and the audio (specifically dialogues) often get distorted.

(I watch on macbook, android phone, and windows pc with studio monitors, and they all have the same problems) I have a 40 Mbps connection and hotstar works well, usually in full hd on my fire tv and pc i dont use it on android. sometimes it buffers when net usage is high but quality never goes below 720p Pay and pirate"

### 1) SARS-­CoV-­2 

* A paper published in a recent issue of the peer­reviewed, open­access journal ‘Emerging Microbes and Infections’ has cautioned that SARS­-CoV-­2, the virus causing the COVID-­19 outbreak, is being shed through multiple routes, so testing through oral swabs alone might not be sufficient
* A paper by Wei Zhang, et al, all from the CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, says investigations on patients in a local hospital infected with the virus revealed the presence of SARS-CoV-­2 in anal swabs and blood as well. What’s more, more anal swabs than oral swabs tested positive at a later stage of infection. Since COVID­19 is believed to be a disease of the respiratory tract, usually only oral swabs are used for diagnosis, and discharge is based on the oral swabs testing negative. The anal positives suggested, they argued, shedding through the oral ­fecal route, and therefore transmission is possible as well. The researchers also showed that a serology test (testing blood for antibodies) can improve detection positive rate, and thus should be used in the future.
* As part of the research, samples ­ including oral swabs, anal swabs and blood were collected by Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital. Two investigations were performed the paper describes ­ In the first investigation, samples were taken from 39 patients, 7 of whom were in a ‘severe condition’. In the second investigation, samples were lifted from 139 patients, whose clinical records were not available.
* When counting all swab positives together, we found most of the positives came from oral swab (8/10, 80%) on day 0. However, this trend appears to change on day 5. We found more (6/8, 75%) anal swab positive than oral swab positive (4/8, 50%)
* The data suggested a shift from more oral positives during the early period to more anal positives during the later period
* The current strategy for the detection of viral RNA in oral swabs used for 2019­nCoV diagnosis is not perfect. The virus may be present in anal swabs or blood of patients when oral swabs detection negative
* This observation implies that a patient cannot be discharged purely based on oral swabs testing negative, and the researchers go on to make a recommendation to do serological tests to confirm the status

* The Government is making an effort to connect every court of the country to the E-court Integrated Mission Mode Project. The establishment of the National Judicial Data Grid will make court procedures easier.
* Future Challenges: It was highlighted that issues like data protection and cybercrimes pose new challenges for the judiciary.

#### E-court Integrated Mission Mode Project

* The E-Courts Project was conceptualized based on the ""National Policy and Action Plan for Implementation of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in the Indian Judiciary - 2005"" submitted by the e-Committee of the Supreme Court of India (set up in 2004).
* The main objectives of the e-Court Project are as follows:
   * To provide efficient & time-bound citizen-centric service delivery.
   * To develop, install & implement decision support systems in courts.
   * To automate the processes to provide transparency of Information access to its stakeholders.
   * To enhance judicial productivity both qualitatively & quantitatively, to make the justice delivery system affordable, accessible, cost-effective & transparent.
* The e-Courts National portal (ecourts.gov.in) was launched in 2013. This provides Case Status, daily Case-list, Cases Filed and Cases Registered through the Case information System (CIS) Software.
* The National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) is a part of the e-Courts Integrated Mission Mode Project. It was launched in 2015. The aim is to track judicial performance across different courts in the country.
   * The NJDG is working as a National data warehouse for case data including the orders/judgments for Courts across the country.
   * NJDG works as a monitoring tool to identify, manage & reduce pendency of cases.
   * It also helps to provide timely inputs for making policy decisions to reduce delay and arrears in the system, facilitate better monitoring of court performance and systemic bottlenecks, and, thus, facilitate better resource management.
   * NJDG has specifically helped India improve its ranking in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Report.

### 6) Joint Commands

Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) office is working on a tentative timeline for the establishment of joint commands among the three defense services Army, Navy and Air Force beginning with an Air Defence Command.

#### Joint Commands

* It is a unified command in which the resources of all the services are unified under a single commander looking at a geographical theatre.
* Meaning, a single military commander, as per the requirements, will have the resources of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force to manage a security threat.
* Functions of joint command:
   * The commander of a joint command will have the freedom to train and equip his command.
   * He will have the logistics of all the services at his beckoning.
   * However, the three services will retain their independent identities as well.
* Joint command at present:
   * There are two tri-services commands at the moment.
   * The joint command at the moment, the Andaman and Nicobar Command (ANC), is a theatre command, which is headed by the chiefs of the three services in rotation. It was created in 2001 after a Group of Ministers had given a report on national security following the Kargil War.
   * The Strategic Forces Command was established in 2006 and is a functional tri-services command.
* What is the structure right now?
   * There are 17 commands, divided among the three services.
   * The Army and the Air Force have seven commands each, while the Navy has three commands.
   * These commands report to their respective services and are headed by three-star officers.
   * Though these commands are in the same regions, they are no located together.
* Need for joint commands?
   * The leader of unified command has control over more varied resources, compared to the heads of the commands under the services now. And the officer commanding will have access to the Air Force’s fighter jets and can use them if needed. Through such integration and jointness, the three forces will be able to avoid duplication of resources. The resources available under each service will be available to other services too. The services will get to know one another better, strengthening cohesion in the defense establishment.
* Do the militaries of other countries have such commands?
   * Several major militaries are divided into integrated theatre commands. China’s People’s Liberation Army has five theatre commands: Eastern, Western, Northern, Southern and Central. Its Western Theatre Command is responsible for India. The US Armed Forces have 11 unified commands, of which seven are geographic and four functional commands. Its geographic commands are Africa, Central, European, Indo-Pacific, Northern, Southern, and Space. Cyber, Special Operations, Transportation and Strategic are its functional commands.

### 7) World’s largest cavefish discovered in Meghalaya

A team of experts from the UK, Switzerland, and India have discovered the world’s largest species of cavefish in Meghalaya’s Jaintia Hills.

#### About

* The cavefish, similar in anatomy to an endangered mahseer species, is around one and a half feet in length and was found inside a remote cave in Jaintia Hills.

### 8) Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR)

* The State Government of Arunachal Pradesh intends to build a highway through the 862 sq km Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR) in East Kameng district.
* The Government had in the past built a highway through the Namdapha National Park.

#### Key Points

* The project is named the East-West Industrial Corridor which is a proposed elevated corridor at the tiger reserve, to be constructed at an estimated cost of Rs.2,550 crore.
* The highway aims to connect Bhairabhunda in West Kameng district and Myanmar in Changlang district along Arunachal Pradesh’s border with Assam.
* The argument over an elevated corridor at the PTR was that it can ensure the free movement of wild animals.
* The state government felt the project would enhance connectivity and develop the state’s foothill areas into economic and industrial zones.

#### Issue Area

* Trees may have to be felled and pillars erected from the ground. Petrol, diesel and other materials will be transported, leading to loss of natural habitat.
* This corridor will be a threat to the adjoining Nameri Tiger Reserve in Assam too.

#### What should the Govt. do?

* The Government, while building such a mega project, should consult renowned conservation organizations in the area and also bring all stakeholders who will be impacted by the project on to the negotiating table.

#### Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR)

* It lies in the foothills of the Eastern Himalaya in the East Kameng district of Arunachal Pradesh.
* It falls within the Eastern Himalaya Biodiversity Hotspot.
* Pakke is also the only Hornbill sanctuary in India.
* The vegetation is predominantly tropical semi-evergreen forest.
* What makes PTR special are the brilliant efforts of the Forest Department and local communities like that of the Nyishi Tribe who inhabit the area around the park to protect the wildlife here.

Preferably, with a budget of not more than 3-4k ?"," I don't think any reasonable shoe can last for years, nor is that something to be expected. They take the abuse, so your feet don't have to.

For example, walking shoes are expected to give out after about 700 kms, which should be about a year under regular use. Asics Gel Lyte would last you a long time. Also they're the best for running. Any sports shoe, at long as you don't use it. I have had Reebok, Puma and Fila.

All these have lasted for about 3 to 4yrs atleast. Never had an issue. ASICS Sketchers. They're costly but worth it imho very comfortable too. Been using one pair for about 2 years now.   
I like asics, or you can try Decathalone For general purpose, Puma shoes are good. For running nothing beats ASICS."

775,Sports,Your thoughts on e-sports,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bwkqxu/your_thoughts_on_esports/,"I recently saw a video where the Danish PM visited the largest e-sports training arena and played Counter Strike Global Offensive (csgo) with their team.
E-sports has undeniably risen and still rising up to huge popularity levels

Yet , in India we see people suggesting that gaming is bad and games should be banned and it feels like our government has no idea that a huge platform like e-sports exists. 

Seeing that people wanted PUBG banned for not acknowledging their mistake or bad parenting also makes it look like majority of India is against e-sports.

What are your thoughts ?"," The main reason that esports hasn't flourished in India yet is because most of the older generation and people of younger generation who don't play games are not educated about the potential of esports and it's success in other countries. Parents would feel embarrassed and would not acknowledge it as a real job.

Second reason is that we Indians don't spend a lot of money, especially on luxury goods, and good PCs are luxury. Hence parents don't feel like it's worth spending money on an industry that they have no idea about and something that could be very volatile.

If we want esports to grow in India, we need to educate people about it. It was difficult in America itself to accept esports as a profession.

I listened to a really good podcast episode between The Esports Observer and Akshat Rathee from NODWIN Gaming where Akshat explains the esports scene in India and also explains why people cheat. It's a must listen for people interested in the esports scene in India. 

Here's the link: https://open.spotify.com/episode/28MfL8Mf8tlwIqvqnUPM15?si=FRP1PciSTuCXZaqJOm4BWQ

Edit: The original link doesn't work anymore for some reason. Here's another link:
https://castbox.fm/vb/98895545 Will only get bigger. It's inevitable. Danish PM playing with Astralis (considered best CSGO team ever) was just a PR move around their election time. That being said, a number of top-tier talents come from Nordic and Scandinavian region.

That being said, a career in esports is still not viable even outside, let alone here. If you're not a talent in a top org, bills become hard to pay. There have been many instances where talented people/ teams had to raise funds from the community itself. I don't know about other games, but Indian CSGO ""pros"" don't have the talent like the EU players. They are just way better. EU just owns.

Also to make big bucks, we ll have to invest time and money. Especially Esports. Also doing it unless you are absolutely sure? Investing thousands of hours practicing? Do you think the ""society"" will accept it? They ll just brand the guy ""addicted to gaming, gaming is bad, it should be banned"". Crosspost to r/indiangaming as well We need a break out star in a competitive game(like faker or sumail) so we can kick start more poeple in our country. We have teams but they are just so far behind international standards... But hopeful since we have so many tournaments now than compared to last decade... In my local area, a lot of gaming pubs host DOTA and CSGO tournaments.

But I believe it's gonna be a long while before esports becomes recognised over here. Unless people take gaming seriously nothing's gonna happen. Half of my friends didn't knew PUBG was a thing unless it hit the play store. I feel pathetic for people calling themselves gamers who play on mobile and despise PC gaming. ( My friends tease me for playing games on PC saying I have no life and shit and yet they play PUBG the whole day. )

Esports won't be a thing unless someone is ready to take flak head on from the Indian society. Our aunties and unkills who believe in doctor and engineer species only. I hope someone revives it.

In the few years I've seen some really great Indian born games on mobile gaming platform. They're not 10/10 but at least they're of the same quality we deserve compared to the western counterpart.

Recently our college was creating clubs. I wanted to make an Esports club badly but I realized 90% of my colleagues wouldn't know its meaning. The idea got buried. Even if I did manage to get the courage and tell my faculties I want an Esports club and explain them, I m pretty sure they'd laugh their ass off and forget about it next day. The general rat culture in our country does not provide a conducive environment for competitive games like Dota/CSGO to flourish.

We might have more players than Europe but the skill level is terrible I don't thing pubg mobile is going anywhere when it comes to esports. It's not precise enough cause touch screen for an event involving skill Give it another 10 years and it will become an Olympic Sport. First of all, let [Redeye talk some sense into you. It's esports.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bO8IaV_DAoY) 

I'm a fellow competitive csgo follower (RIP Astralis era btw). Majority of India has no concept of esports. I think we need to convince a certain influential Gujarati man to educate our masses about esports, because I see no other way of esports growth in India. Not in the near future at least. People don't considered gaming/streaming an occupation here. I bet most of the people don't know about joining esport orgs For e sports to be a thing people must buy the damn games.Excluding cheap and free games like CS,Dota,TF2 etc which game has a large enough player base to even ask this question? pc parts cost 2x more in India and people don't think its good investment. The reason why esports haven't taken off in India is that we don't have any fallback options. There are no social safety net and any breaks taken during education is extremely frowned upon by Indian society and in extent Indian firms. Let's say, you try your hands on esports, you play well but not good enough to make a living out of it. Then you need to get a job and that's only backed up by education. No firm will hire you if you put esports in your cv. Not to mention if you take a break in your studies to pursue esports, there's a good chance your cv will be thrown into the dustbin even before it reaches the interviewer.

The same is applicable for other type of sports. Football is very popular in West Bengal, but most players are struggling hard to make ends meet. If you've watched Dangal then you'd know what happens to Amir in the movie is a reflection of what happens to our society in general. The only two ways to make an honest living in India is either through education or through business. Esports won't help you in either in the long run. Don't you remember the PM referencing pubg? I feel that e-sports is pernicious for the society in general. It promotes an unhealthy lifestyle. Playing video-games for long enough to become the best at them ought to have a deleterious effect on one's health, both physical and mental. Even though I love playing video games, Sports for me is still something physical. Sports? Are they still calling them sports to make them feel and sound more legit? Lol"

Wtf is she a retard or what? She is the government. There is no government decision without her vote. > If the decision is already taken, then I will just follow that. 

Mary Kom is just a rubber stamp for the RSS-BJP. This is why celebrities shouldn't be voted to power.

Translation: If I vote against it, I might not be allowed to  participate in Tokyo Olympics. 


> Her statement has not gone down well with the people from Northeast.

Her selfishness and stupidity would make anyone angry. “I am not a politician. If the Government has taken a decision then even if I request them to withdraw CAB. It’s not going to be withdrawn. At this stage, it’s not going to stop. If the decision is already taken, then I will just follow that.""

Then what are you doing in Rajya Sabha? If you are not even going to protest against wrong, than you are worse than the perpetrator. It's not just her,entire BJP MPs have same attitude more the half of MPs in loksabha are elected only because of Modi fame they can't win election on their own so they don't have opinion on anything just follow what party says play safe get in good books of the Modi. Tl dr :

Dekhiye hume paisa chahiye. Power bhi. Isiliye ap kripya khudka chutiya katwaye taaki main apna clout barkarar rakh saku. Reminds me of a quote by someone 

""You can be the best sportsperson in the world but still, you can't be Mohammed Ali, he was much more than a sportsperson"" 

These sports person (especially Sachin) don't understand the thing that they are inspiration for many and if they speak about a certain issue, millions will listen to them and try to understand them. But they always try to escape the political discourse, this is very unfortunate, it's like wasting a resource, a potential.

Mohammed Ali was one of very few sports person of the world who was hugely popular and he used to protest against social Injustice (whatever his stand was) in society, openly criticizing the government. His followers would listen to him and his words had a lot more impact than an ordinary citizen saying the same things. Phogats, Deols, Kumars and now Koms.. 

Some fool said it right.. celebrities should just mind their own business."

779,Sports,"TIL: Record for highest attendance during a sporting event in India was during 1997 Federation Cup Semi Final between East Bengal & Mohan Bagan that witnessed an audience of 131,781 at Salt Lake Stadium, Kolkata.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dindz9/til_record_for_highest_attendance_during_a/,"Most of you probably know that they are bitter rivals. East Bengal won the game 4-1 with Bhaichung Bhutia scoring a hat-trick. 

I came across this while reading about yesterday's match between India and Bangladesh where the attendance was 61,486. Probably one of the highest in recent times.

> It is to be wondered what would have happened if the AIFF, in a weak moment, reacted to Amal Dutta's suggestion that a foreign referee must be given charge of the match. And if the foreign referee, as Dutta wished, was a strict, unyielding man, the semi-final may not have taken place. For clearly, there were more people in the Salt Lake Stadium than the maximum meant to be accommodated when it was newer and in better condition. Instead of the maximum capacity of 1,20,000, there were 1,31,781. And the precise number mentioned by press reports lends belief that the figures had been given officially.

> Which means that knowingly, the AIFF and the IFA had allowed nearly 12,000 people more for the highly tense semi-final, an unpardonable excess. **The attendance set two records. One for the highest turn-out for any match, not only in India but also anywhere in Asia, and maybe anywhere in the world save for the matches at the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.**

A good article about it:

> http://inbedwithmaradona.com/journal/2013/7/22/6phssedqppiaxjndh9sxxm3jph49r7"," I'd say that's when Indian football peaked out. The coming decade was so bad economically that some INFL winning clubs would fold within few years due to lack of proper infrastructure of the sport and fanfare in general. The league barely got any broadcast and only Kolkata/Goan clubs would have any chance of making money.

This decade was a mixed bag, on one end people started taking interest in the sport but on the other end clubs continued to go bankrupt. Goan clubs are simply happy to play in the Goan Pro league whilst Kerala, Kolkata and NE are the only bastions of football."

Instead of sports class every day, let them go home 1 hour early  and have their own play hour.
 Or organise an indoor games session Literally sports in Indian schools is a total joke. 

You are not allowed to touch equipments, javelin throw, table tennis, etc. are either rusted lying in a corner or being used only by popular kids. 

Only the popular kids who keep in touch with the sports teacher are only allowed for tournaments and stuff.

Our school interpreted this as a compulsory PT session and threatened to not give Boards admit cards to students who didn't want to do PT. Sports is going for the growth of our children. But the schools should have proper infrastructure. That's 13 years late. Sports period everyday? Not against the idea but we used to have 2 sports period a week where we were just left like stray dogs out in the scorching heat feeling free to do whatever the fuck we wanted (as long as it was confined to the open ground). 
No proper sports outfit, no proper sports equipment, infrastructure, most importance, seriousness. 
Schools pretend to be caring about a student's physical development. Rather than increasing eve frequency, come up with a well designed plan and test it for a smaller frequency.  It seems like only my school had decent sports facilities, and I used to look forward to sports period since it was only once or twice a week.  Sports aka second lunch recess/bunk period for anyone who isn't interested in sports.

Or stand in the heat for an hour so that you get a heatstroke while not even playing sports because there is not enough equipment and you can't go in with the athletic people.

Getting a haircut in your vest was normal in my village, but recently when I was getting a haircut, I didn't want all my hair on my formal shirt, so I removed it, but another guy sitting nearby passed a weird look, as if I were a rube. 

I feel it is more practical, especially when it's hot, because it gets even hotter under the cloth in the salon, and maybe unless you're at one of those expensive judgmental 1.6lpm salons, practicality should come first. 

What do you guys do?"," Your barber didn't place a long towel on your shirt? Have had haircuts from 20 rs under the tree to 50 rs, where i have to keep an eye out not to get AIDS from a reused blade, and yet never seen this kind of stunt. Must be a regional thing.

Here in Bombay we just put on a regular tee for a haircut, a hairdressers is a messy place and i wouldnt go for a haircut in a fancy shirt because that would be crazy like going to a sulabh sauchalay in a tuxedo. That is weird! That shows that the person is from village. You are like those unkills, who later get their armpits also shaven. [deleted] I wear loose, casual, not-so-important cloths to saloon. Yes it's weird, I've never seen anyone do it I never show skin in public (except at beaches), so I am always as fully clad as I can be. I go to those Rs.50-80 places in bangalore, and sometimes see people removing their shirts off. 


I also see quite a few people removing their shirts after the haircut and getting their underarms shaved. Never seen this back in my home town. Remove it. You are the customer.  You are old enough to do what you want.  The only catch is if you have to do buisness with anyone who might not approve of your practical approach.

When the barber used to come to the house, we removed our shirts... Yes. Keep your clothes on, please."

>She eventually started playing badminton from the age of eight. Sindhu first learned the basics of the sport with the guidance of Mehboob Ali at the badminton courts of Indian Railway Institute of Signal Engineering and Telecommunications in Secunderabad. Soon after, she joined Pullela Gopichand's Gopichand Badminton Academy. While profiling Sindhu's career, a correspondent with *The Hindu* wrote:  
>  
>*""The fact that she reports on time at the coaching camps daily, travelling a distance of 56 km from her residence, is perhaps a reflection of her willingness to complete her desire to be a good badminton player with the required hard work and commitment.""*

Proud of her, she deserves it ❤️ Yesss,This is huge considering she had lost in her previous two final appearances.
  
This is also a ruthless revenge for her narrow loss in the final against Okuhara in 2017 since she beat her in only 38 minutes! bless you, Sindhu. Wonderful effort by Sindhu! Hats off to Pullela Gopichand as well! Awesome she absolutely dominated Okuhara. 21-7 21-7 wow  thumping victory

Edit: (7:00PM) You can still watch the match on hotstar. starts at 2:23:00 mark

Thank you for making India proud Sindhu! She's a true national treasure This was one of the most one sided final I have ever seen. *Akshay Kumar has entered the chat* Amazing. Really proud of her This was sheer perseverance that finally paid off. Congratulations and this has to be one of the proudest moments of not only her life, but Indian sports as a whole. Not to forget, she dedicated this medal to her mother. It was her birthday today. Best gift ever. Congratulations!

As per the buzz Akshay is going to make movie out of this. He will act as Gopichand. Yay !! Sindhu 😍 Congratulations, golden girl. Truly dominant on court. Hope this erases the idea that she always falls one short from people's minds. Goodminton 21-7, 21-7

That's pure dominance!

Just recently I came through videos of viral dancer going by name of baba Jackson and installed tiktok to watch his videos.
Browsing tiktok for the past few days made me realize....

You don't need money to buy happiness..there are teawallahs, slum dwellers ,even vegetable vendors who make tiktok videos , 
It may sound cringe but if you tell me to act happy or something, It would be damn difficult for me to even sport a smile ..being introvert is also a factor.

There are couples who don't even have a proper house of their own, yet they are confident and happy enough to make those lovey dovey cringe  videos.

In Instagram ,most of the influencers are usually loaded and have a good safety net.

But in tiktok ,there are many popular creators who are dirt poor."," I realized this long back.

Whatever they are doing makes them happy.

So let them be.

Let them have their little happy moments. 

Life is pretty chaotic for most people in India. 

If you have a problem with them, uninstall the app.

As simple as that. True. People judge tiktok users a lot though as if they are beneath them. Just like all social media it has its cons but banning it just because someone thinks its cringe is stupid. It is source of happiness for many and a platform to showcase talent for a few. One man's cringe is another man's entertainment. But sometimes cringe is so strong! It's unbearable. Most of them are novice Uninstalled all social media why ?
They made me feel how shit my life was, but in reality everyone has shit lives Frankly Baba Jackson is the only wholesome tiktok guy there for me,
Then there's Indian joker. Good help him. Many people look up to bollywood stars and want to act like them but they cant cause of financial problems. Tik tok gives them the mean to act like them and have fun. Tiktok reminds me of the early days of YouTube when people were happy uploading videos of themselves dancing and singing with 240p cameras and shit lighting. There was just this joy at the idea of being able to create and share.

Instagram is just plain cancer > But in tiktok ,there are many popular creators who are dirt poor.

For now, then it will become an act. And, everyone around him/her will be unhappy. That's the design of these social media apps. Avoid tiktok, fuckin chinese data gathering app."

793,Sports,India’s Sumit Nagal took down Roger Federer 6-4 in the first set!! Yay!!,https://i.redd.it/yp1w5yi7ewi31.jpg,," 1-1 after two sets but really happy to see an Indian playing singles in the main draw. I remember the French open match between Somdev Devvarman and Nadal 7-8 years ago.

The first two sets were really close but Nadal just upped his game and sailed through.

Damn, what happened to that guy. He showed a lot of promise. It’s an amazing performance by the young man. Showed a lot of heart. Surpassed my expectations.
Let’s see if he can keep it up over multiple sets. Move over Nadal, Nagal is the new kid in town! 

All aboard the Nagal hype train, choo choo! This is like teleporting to the final stage boss right after you start the game and actually winning with your shitty blaster He tried his best. Really proud He just lost How do we add a picture of him there ? Next 2 sets Federer has turned it on. Still much more than expected. He gave a good fight, but Federer just proved why he is liked the world over. His first ever set in the US Open and he bested Federer dayum. Hoping he would win the match was wishful thinking imo but this in itself is a great achievement and I hope he continues to grow. damn, Federer really showed him why he's the greatest. Props to Nagal for downing him one set out of four, though! Second set not looking good so far :( Google doesn't even have his pic Is there a live stream? Roger Federer won in the end. But Sumit Nagal showed if players like him are given more opportunities they can really defeat the biggest players in the town. Some good shots by the lad. A lot of credit goes to Virat Kohli... 

Confused? 

Virat Kohli Foundation has been helping and inspiring the youth of our country to follow their passion and dreams. They facilitate in providing the much needed help in preparing people like Sumit to scale at tremendous heights.., First Sindhu then this guy. 4-6,6-1,6-2,6-4 final score fyi Sorry, this feels like Ironman versus Thanos.

Can half imagine Fed say in Swiss accent, ""All this for a drop of blood....""

Well played buddy! The guy has the talent, great winner there! Nangal Dam!!!! Headbutting the  Grandmaster himself. Big deal. 

Great Job Sumit Nagal Damn federer is getting his ass kicked left and right last year and this year I wish more people knew about how big a thing this is. There is always a Indian better thn you. Really amazing Performance,feel proud as an Indian. Madlad I am excited that an Indian just 22 years old is showing so much potential but it would have been more glorious if his coaching would have been in India. only nadal or djokovic can match fedrrer Great performance !  The P.V Sindhu Factor Is Strong Lol Does anyone in India care about table tennis anyway? Really proud of sumit!! I wish him all the best! Super Sumit Nagal or Sumit Nadal?????? :))) Holy crap, this is big. Excellent! This is amazing stuff. Way to go Nagal, damn proud you. Ye toh bas shuruvaat hai, keep up good job! It's true though.  We have the most people in the world that deficate outside and on the beaches.  We need to stop doing this.  The internet has brought it to the world.  Im in Bogotá Colombia and was hitting on a girl and we met like six times then one day in front of all my new friends she pulls some bs up on the computer and shows a YouTube video of us shitting on railroad tracks... Like 100 people walking out of their homes to poo.  Everyone laughed at me so I just left Wow, nice going Sumit! shit I'm watching this now! Kid's got heart! Holy shit balls! hum indians choti choti baaton mein khushiyan dhuoond hi lete hain. Supported by VK! [deleted] All the big matches are fixed, they wanted to give some spotlight to an Indian so they let him win one set, but that's all they'll give. Oh great... Now parents are going to spend money on their kids tennis lessons instead of teaching them how to not public deficate.  Our country has the biggest public defication crisis in the world"
794,Sports,"17 y/o girl, wants to be a chef, parents stereotyping. [advice]",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/etpkb0/17_yo_girl_wants_to_be_a_chef_parents/," 

I've been trying to make a post about this for a long time now, i feel like i haven't found the right words.

Anyway, I'm a 17 year old, in a tight corner. So to give you a backstory, I love baking/cooking and people say i'm a very good baker. I'm also a tennis player (national level). And i do well academically. I've always loved experimenting with my kitchen. so naturally i wanted to be a chef. As a person into many things, i feel like I'm more comfortable with culinary arts.

And I've been trying to convince my parents to get me into culinary school. They are not obliging. They feel that their child is 'too talented' and that my 'potential' is being wasted on culinary arts. and they're being very stereotypical and telling me that i'll have to cook for my husband after marriage anyway. And that being a chef isn't a 'respectable' profession. This has been going on for around 3 years now and I've made them talk to people, showed them all the researches i did on culinary arts and the career i could make out of it. and all the colleges i could get into but to no avail.

Sometimes it gets hard. My parents aren't exactly the type that appreciates you when you do something big. They just ask me to keep pushing no matter what. That kinda takes a toll on me oftentimes. and they want me to pursue engineering. I mean I'm okay with it but its not my thing. Maybe they're doing this because of the sports quota. they just keep telling me that i should pursue a 'noble' profession and not culinary arts. either engineering or english literature/sociology and take up UPSC exams.

It feels like they're living my life for me. I don't wanna sound ungrateful i love my parents for providing me with everything but i feel like there's a hidden motive. like my dad enrolling me in tennis coaching at a very young age and he straight up admitted recently that he did it because i'd get into engineering easily.

And two months ago when i was on the verge of giving into engineering, i told my parents that i was okay with either chemical engineering/aerospace but that's when i realised that they were controlling even the branch of engineering i'm supposed to take. They were hell bent on me taking up csc/ece. so ultimately i started resenting them (not only for this, but for various other reasons too).

Each day it keeps getting worse and i wanna move away for college and take up culinary arts. but my parents are so against me moving away for college . but I'm pretty sure they wouldn't pay my fee if i take up culinary arts. at this point I'm willing to move away for college regardless of the course. I feel like my parents are being narrow minded, the person i wanna be is exactly not the person they want me to be. The amount of toxicity that my parents are inflicting upon me is immeasurable.

If you've ever been in this position / have a piece of advice for me, please comment. If you wanna know more about a specific part here, ask me. I'd be happy to elaborate. This is very serious and I'm helpless."," How much are you willing to sacrifice to achieve your goal? Is your goal worth those sacrifice? You have a lot of soul searching to do here. If you let your parents control the very aspect of your life that you have to live with all your life then you will resent the hell out of them when you have a failure in your academic life or eventual career, which, believe you me, everyone does. 

I'll give you two examples here, both are of my friends and you can take from it whatever you like. My friend named Ashish comes from a Marwari family and his father is a sales consultant. When he was 17, he was adamant that he wanted to do hospitality management like his cousin, who was pursuing it in London and not become a CA like his father wanted him to be. He eventually gave into his father's wishes and pursued being a CA. It took him 7 years to become a CA but he eventually became one and now has his own practice. He earns decent money now, married but resents his father to this day.

The second guy, Nikunj, brilliant in studies, just like you, and wanted to pursue commerce to become a banker but his parents insisted he do engineering since he scored to high a percentage in his boards to 'waste' it by doing a commerce course. He never completed his engineering and resented his parents for it. He eventually got into actuarial science and flourished; eventually his relationship with his parents improved too. 

Take what you may of these examples but imho you do what you love to do in life. Money will follow you no matter what. If you love what you do and are good at what you do the money will come to you no matter what.

P.S : Your parents expecting you to cook for your husband everyday is beyond shameful. I hope you don't feel obligated to be the typical subservient woman that is expected in an Indian household after your marriage, if you choose to marry. This patriarchal shit needs to end. [deleted] [deleted] Two questions, how far are you willing to go? and how far will your parents go? 

The choice you are going to make is a difficult one. Whatever choice you make, it is going to define your near future (or maybe even far), for better or for worse. Talk to your parents about this. It is not only just what you say, but also how you say it matters. They shouldn't think that you making a decision based on a fantasy or something.  Don't be afraid to tell your parents what you feel about them, add on extra resentment to your feelings if you feel like it.

I'd like to assume they are someone who loves their daughter more than 'log kya kahenge' bullshit. At least, it was the case for me and my sister. The ultimatum to choose between their son and not talking to them for over 2 months plus not staying in home for more than what's required to sleep, brush, and shit sure showed them that I was serious with my threats. 

Indian society sure does teach their children to be a headless chicken in pursuit of their parent's dreams. If you think you need your parents, in the future, maybe consider for a second that you probably don't need them. I am going to go out on a limb and drop an unpopular opinion - you are not obligated to love your parents. You are not obligated to do shit for them. But they, on the other hand, are obligated to look after you. If they treat you like human, you treat them the same way just like any other person. If they don't, you don't either. I would 100% advice you to be as blunt as possible with your parents now. Tell them exactly how you feel not just about your career but also about your relation with them in the future, even if it sours your relationship with them now. Personally, it made the relationship between me and my mother a lot stronger than it was even if they went into the gutter a for a couple of years in between. Simple thing

Ask yourself is this something that i would love doing all my life ??

Even if this doesn't work out you're in a better place than a whole lot of people What's wrong in being a chef ? Sorry for your Inbox."

They no longer need Bollywood stars to sing and dance to attract audience to their product. It is already an established sporting event. Also, there is a very little new that they can do - the excitement for opening ceremony goes down when you have it every year (as opposed to Olympics or World cup opening ceremonies which happen at a new place every 4 years and are an opportunity for host nation to show-case their cultural heritage and creativity) Ganguli effect ? Looks like somebody is using thier brains To replace the opening ceremony, how about an exhibition match between the owners? That would be a fun sight, watching billions of rupees running around on a pitch with no formal training in the sport whatsoever. Jay Shah at work Still giving free tickets to the matches for BCCI members so cost cutting as long as it doesnt effect them I think this step is taken because of its stability. Like no matter what people will come and enjoy IPL. Now they don't need to promote it again and again by doing an opening ceremony. I don't like opening ceremony. But almost everything is waste of money depending on priorities. Hope they advertise their sponsors more discreetly with the money saved Great I'm sure that money can be sent to the govt instead.

799,Sports,Not many car models available in India,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ejtlnw/not_many_car_models_available_in_india/,"Was just watching YouTube when came across many videos related to German and US car makers like Dodge, GMC etc. Many of the cars released abroad are not released in India? Why is that? Like Ford Raptor , GMC Denali, Dodge Hellcat, Cardilac, Even some of the Models of Merc and BMW. What might be the reason??"," The Indian car market is very difficult to penetrate into. We want cars that are cheap to own, cheap to run, cheap to repair and still seats 4-5 people at least. Whereas in western countries, the market dynamics are twisted. In the US, for instance, sedans are most common whereas in India it's little econobox hatchbacks. They measure fuel economy in gallons and we do so in litres. We want a lot of features but aren't able to pay the price. Things like this is why a lot of car makers have cars exclusively made for India, such as the Renault Kwid. Most of the cars you mentioned in the original post are from GM - DMC, Cadillac, Dodge etc. To be blunt, GM makes atrocious cars with abysmal quality. It takes a fortune to repair most of these and you will have to repair them. Another issue is that most of these vehicles are huge and expensive, and a very few people will buy them even if it is sold in India. GM tried to establish a market in India with Chevrolet, but again failed miserably. BMW and Benz sell most of their models in India, but they don't sell most of their sports car line up because 99% Indians can't or won't buy sports cars. So, it makes no sense to sell them in India. US cars are garbage. GM had to quit India after trying to dump China-made Chevrolet Sail.

FCA brands like Dodge have poor reputation even in the US for reliability issues.

Even Merc and BMW dump outdated models in India which are prone to breakdown in Indian conditions. No market here. infrastructure is so bad that models of 90s or 80s of these high end cars remain no longer reliable I think some of these brands, like Ford or GM, lack the commitment to fight it out in a very price sensitive market such as India. Both of these giants had a go, but recently pulled out of the Indian market, if I am not mistaken.

The Indian auto market also has some shit taxation system e.g. cars less than 4 meters in length are taxed much lesser, similarly engines less than 1.2liter (petrol) /1.5liter (diesel) have a lower tax. The 4 meter rule is why we have abominations like the Swift Dzire, a top seller in India, mind you.

The brands you have mentioned usually sell bigger cars with huge engines and the small car with smaller engine game is not really GM/Ford's forte. Add to that the perception that American cars are not very reliable, and this has made it very difficult for them to crack this market.

To be honest, the only companies doing big numbers are Maruti (more than 50% of the market) and Hyundai. The others don't do much better than 10,000 units per month with their entire portfolios. Kia, with just one model, passed Tata's marketshare recently (IIRC) within 4 months of their entry.

The BMWs, Mercs etc. are great cars but frankly overpriced here due to the taxes and low volumes. They are typically double the cost here than in the US and we still get smaller engines with lower horsepower."
800,Food,Migrant worker breaks down while being offered food. Source in comments.,https://v.redd.it/zsbcsrzqzdp41,," Who are the nice people offering the food? Is it an NGO? One woman seems uniformed. Are they from the government? UP Delhi border from last two days is uncontrollable. UP and Delhi gov have arranged busses to ferry the workers but all of them are more crowded than any normal day, people are climbing on roof of the buses, thousands pf men women children are on the streets. Crowd management is total failure there The rich brought the virus to our soil, and the poor are the ones that suffer.
While people I know are trying to figure out where they’d get their next packet of cigarettes from, migrant workers are on the streets breaking down on the sight of food to eat, and a clean bottle of water.
I feel so helpless that I can’t physically do more than just rant on the Internet. I hate this feeling. [deleted] Fuck. I wasn't ready for this.

Can't imagine the trauma 1000s are going through away fron their families with no food or shelter.

Really puts things in perspective when you see such things.

How can the government choose to ignore this. Empathy nahi hai saalo mein.

Hindu Muslim Right Left doesn't matter. Humanity should come first. Those aren’t tears of gratitude. Please don’t mistake them for that. Sure, there is some gratitude behind them, but know this: behind every tear the poor shed, there is restrained anger, hidden shame, wounded pride. Every one of those tears is telling them that this is no way of living, only to have to live like that for many, many days to come. Someone will come who will weaponize those emotions and no tyrant will be able to stand against them. For now, all we can do is hope that such a day will come.’ I'm kinda torn about this. On the one hand I see the importance of letting the country know how bad the situation has become. On the other, I think taking a  video of this man crying steals the few shreds of dignity he has left. Yaar koi reliable ngo/organisation doing something about this? How can we help?! Source - https://twitter.com/aaqibrk/status/1243594510480707585?s=19 And here I am sitting at my home complaining over small things, seeing this video made me think how undeserving I am, this man probably busts his ass all day providing for his family and that's a normal day.... I can even begin to imagine what so many people are going through, it's as if we are all on a ship and they have been left in the cold dark sea, just with a floater.... I pray they get through this. And the people helping them are absolute heroes. Wish they reach home soon.. We have failed as a society. Imagine being recorded while you shed tears of pain Man this really puts things into perspective. How life can be difficult, unforgiving. At one moment you leave for a city far away with dreams, ambition and hope. And at another all of that is taken from you.  More people are going to suffer due to the unemployed caused by coronavirus than coronavirus itself. This is sad. Very sad. I lost my sadism and sarcasm looking at this i am serious. I never feel so helpless upon seeing these people. No one deserve to face such. 
I couldn't control my tears. Still thinking why. Corona virus has revealed real, terrible holes in our system. We have an economy that heavily relies on efforts of exactly those who used up and chewed out and treated like dirt.

If we learn anything from this crises, let it be the fact that our neoliberal, capitalist society has time and time again failed vast majority of its participants because of lack of humanity of the process. We need to wake up or this becomes a new normal. Good to see people are coming forward. While it wont do a lot, it is a good place to start. The most shocking part is that some people are blaming these poor folks for the situation. They also applaud each time they see police brutality in the name of this lockdown. Empathy is pretty much dead I think in India. Ok, i get it... it is emotional... but don't zoom in when someone is breaking down..give them some privacy In spite of being a huge critic of Modi, I appreciated the decision of lockdown he took. But at that point of time, I didn't consider the situation of these workers. Of course, he has a team of specialists so they must have known what is gonna happen regarding this. So I don't understand why they couldn't give any time for these workers to reach their villages beforehand by announcing the lockdown a couple of days ahead. All our money is of no use if we can't do anything for humanity. on top of that we are fed hindu muslim pakistan everyday. UP government has recently allotted 1,000 buses to bring people back home. I wish I can make a difference in the world when I grow up 💔 To all my fellow Indians, at a time like this, those of us who have the luxury to stay home and have the means to help others should take care of the less fortunate. We cannot just blame the government and expect them to take care of each an every individual. It is important we the regular people do our part. You can find some NGO to donate to, I hope some here can provide a link of a reliable one but it is better if you find a local initiative in your community. If you dont have one then start one, but it is important if each person contributes to their local community Jo bhi ho, from Demonetisation to Lockdown, it is the lower class people who has to suffer. Oh dear...i teared up a bit there. I cant imagine who to thank the relative comfort i have in life. That lad will do something for himself. The circumstances that have led him and countless others to this situation are so out of their control that tears seem appropriate. I wish him well. Isn't there anything us commoners can do for them from our homes??? Rula diya vencho T_T Why the fuck are they being filmed like that ? A man's having a weak moment. Give them their fucking space. Gosh. Seems more like a gimmick. Sad to see this... I assume this situation is coz of landlords who asked these people to vacate houses as in these times they cannot pay rent. 

From what I know the first migrant worker sets up a base in the city and establishes himself... takes more work and calls more people from his village convincing their families that he'll earn a good amount. They stay in groups of 6-8 or more.

Here's the states responsibility of not creating enough jobs is the prime reason. We also should have a threshold limit of population control for each city.  Jo ye bichare jis pareshani se jhuujh rahe hai wo kisi bhi pandemic se badi hai Income inequality aur poverty itni badi emergency ko hum sabne kabhi ek problem k taur per nhi dekha. Aaj Covid19 ne jo life k matrix mein glitch daal k hum sabki aankhein kholi hai usse shayad humari Insaniyat wapas aa Jaye. 


I know many chutiyas in my family who will blame everything on Illuminati and then entire day they will bitch and be toxic to every person they meet but somehow praying to God makes them a better person . These deluded imbeciles are the main reasons why politicians win elections kyonki simple minded ko apeel karne k liye bhashan kaafi hai aur aise deluded log kabhi khud ko nhi Question karte. /u/vredditdownloader I'm out of words. This breaks my heart, i hope they reach home safe and sound . This is honestly so fucking sad I am feeling sad for them Damn its tough to watch a grown man breaking apart like that. It's always the poor who suffer the most during time like these. I have nothing but to thank those beautiful souls providing food. Fuck. This broke my heart This made me cry. I beg the government to atleast provide them shelters or transport to reach their homes. The poor always suffers in this nation. Guys please donate to PM CARES fund. what are some legit charities / foundations we can donate to and ensure that our money is well spent These people are the ones building our homes, roads, bridges and the country. It fucking breaks my heart seeing them like this that they are facing hardships getting even a plate of food. Guys, Do you know any NGOs that I can donate to? A trusted NGO? It's so easy to forget about this part of our country while sitting in a well furnished room with all basic amenities. (Myself included). Whoever helps during these times, I wish them every happiness and comfort in their lives. I wish I was earning to contribute in some way. It's ironic but I will say it anyway - ""Together we stand"". The tears from him explain how important food is.  I hope the donors provide free food daily until they have their regular wages. Is there anything Modi does with proper planning? I couldn’t help but break down looking at this. How can I send money to help them ? This gave me chills. Anyone who is privileged enough to be on reddit from the comfort of their homes should be very very grateful. But we all know we will never be. So my tax money goes to netas ghar, 10-20Rs ki chicken in government premises, traveling abroad, buying private jets... This post is not written by drawn into emotions. All of this migration could have been avoided if Modi would have worked with state governments to feed everyone who is out of regular wages (like community kitchen opened across Kerala during this pandemic). Instead he did the usual drama, probably not even consulting his ministers. This migration is going to be the equivalent of army personnels spreading spanish flu to the nooks and corners of Europe. I appreciate the effort and concern but just imagine going into the face of man with a camera/phone and recording him breaking down in tears thats not good. Its partially gratitude and partially embarrassment. 

One of the hardest things for anybody in this world is to accept help. It's hard for a man to ask for help. A grown man who did all he could to make an honest living breaks down because of a pandemic. 

I feel so helpless and hopeless looking at this suffering but honestly the reality is I felt so good about myself just because of the sadness this makes me feel. 

It makes me feel better, 
than that someone, who doesn’t care. 

The complaining and the sorrow is essentially my coping mechanism for the tragedy that this is. 

I broke down slightly this morning, when I spoke to my father asking him to make sure the workers in our small shop are taken care of(because of this post). 
I made sure he didn’t notice my tears.

Namesake are those tears or even selfish at best. 

I wish there was someone that i could pin this on.

Other than the fact that this is a world that we live in and so we carry on.

Many of these people won’t make it. But I am sure I will.

At least I will make it out of this better than most. 
Thank the lottery that these brothers lost
And I won. While it is truly moving, I wish the person filming gave the man some dignity, and did not take the camera to his face.

These are tough times. Remember, United We Stand. I don't know how right I am , but I still think instead of  arrangements of Busses to travel back home UP govt. should have invested in Tents or supplies for our fellow migrants workers, for they shouldn't have to be forced to walk back home.

When asked in various news sources almost everyone said ""Paise Khatam ho gye hai, hum bhukey hai kai dino se, Corona se pehle to hum bhuuk se mar jayenge.""

(Translation: We are hungry and not eaten for many days and we have no money left and will die of hunger even before Corona gets us.)

Maybe, just maybe I think they made arrangements for busses because I don't for sure but i think we didn't have enough funds to feed this many people. So they decided to let every help them there houses instead.
But this might backfire as they are so desperate right now that they don't care for social distancing and all. Well its not there fault , as one in this times would be. But there's a risk of carrying the virus in great numbers to their respective villages. 

Damn. If China would have put a permanent Ban on some animal traded in there Wet Markets learning from SARS and also have not suppressed they Doc. who tried to Warn their Govt. about this virus.. Things would have been way different.. I dislike - immensely - the camera angle.

Hear me out: to be standing \*over\* the desperate, at a time when eating ( usually a rather 'private' activity in rural areas) and while these migrants are seated on a rough road...makes me even sadder.

Everything about this situation is despicable. 

Ok - the ""so what would you have done"" - I would have crouched down to a lower level, explained that I would like to take images in order to help get more food/relief for others via social media/MADia and only then taken images

My 2c I understand the intention of filming this, but it comes off as poverty porn. Esp the zoom on the crying. Social media has made charity moments so much worse than those donate videos on TV. To stop you from watching this, they did this:

If someone knows any dependable organization that we can donate to? I'm not donating to any sarkari funds anymore so please don't suggest that. This is sad. Please stay strong. How can I help? So hungry. Thank goodness they recorded it, otherwise it would have been all in vain. It's unfair the people who are paying the price are the ones who will further be discriminated if they contract the virus. 

In days we ll see affluent get better care than the rest. lock-down was imminent 

but is there government help for all the employed and unemployed?

awaiting news.... Migrant workers are really taking the hit. They do not have home or saving like us to take the blunt of crisis. These people live and feed themselves on daily wage so can't lock themselves like us. If this virus hit India like US then Generations are going to remember this for a long time. I can’t imagine what’s like being offered food. I am very glad they are in India. Even though it has huge population and is very god country. helping hands reach every corner at tough times as every government scheme rwxhes every rural area. Ofcourse some goes unnoticed, everything can't be taken care of. They should be glad, they are back again in India and they will be taken care of. u/vredditdownloader no touching face ! These are tough times for everyone😞 Oh my god. My heart aches so much seeing this. Dear friends please stand up for one another. this chaos is because of unplanned lockdown by the govt This is heart-breaking, I cannot imagine the plight of these migrant workers. But he should not have been touching his face like that... Not during times like these. Hope this NGO offered sanitizers before giving them food. Both central and state governments have massively fucked up, everyone knew what was coming and still these people were left to die. [removed] why are they migrating back to villages, can't they stay in Delhi and Delhi govt can take care of the food and basic stuff. Shame on system!! IMO it is utterly insensitive & cruel to shoot on mobile phones like that when people in need & bad situation are eating an offered meal on road...its as cruel as shooting someone's video while dying.. these are self respecting & self earning individuals having a rough patch due to no falt of theirs but due to the knee jerk reaction by their government w/o any planning or addressing their valid concerns behind all the panic. Pseudo-entitled chutiyas on my feed are defending and patting the Govt on the back for this.

They really should be put through such circumstances so that next time they think of the 80% population who goes hand-to-mouth.

Fucking boils my blood on what have we elected to govern us. Heart-breaking, that's all I can say. What are the leaders doing? Playing Ramayana and promoting some narrative. Poor guy. I know exactly how that feels like. They deserve much more than this. This is barely covering their rights as humans. This government is ruthless... This is heartbreaking :( Why the fuck you filming that guy. Would you like someone to film you when you in this emotional state. For fuck sake give him some space. Shame on the person shooting this. Capturing someone's private emotions without their consent is absolutely deplorable. The least they could have done is blur the face. 

I have a question for you Redditors - how many of you would like your weak moment posted all over the internet, even if it were to prove a legitimate point? The Government should spend money on more infirmaries instead of making statues. If they take this situation as a lesson then next time we would be ready to tackle these kinds of situations. Look at this cunt, hes crying, just gonna stick my camera in his fuckin face Clips like these only serve at appealing to emotions over common sense. Why are migrant workers returning to their native places (and potentially bringing the disease to small villages), instead of sheltering in place? The whole point of shelter in place is to stop the spread of disease. And it’s only mandated for 21 days not indefinite. Here is a thread that I posted about the misery and utter helplessness this unplanned lockdown has resulted in for the labourers and poor. 
https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fpx36l/a_thread_on_how_this_regime_with_its_marvellous/ :( r/HumansBeingBros Well, stop fucking filming him then? Do you know how embarrassing it can be to be in a pathetic situation and then someone films your embarrassment?

It makes no difference to anyone whether he was crying or not. Or for fuckity sake atleast be discreet instead of shoving the camera in his face to capture how he breaks down in various photographic angles you sick cock. It would be so awkward for me if people were filming me while doing good things for me. It's like, are you doing this for me, or the cameras? Susashan ki sarkar hai
Lauda ki sarkar hai. I don’t think anyone speaks his language but the guy holding the camera is literally insulting him. He’s saying “get the fuck outta mah country you brow... curry stin... migrant worker! Stop stealing awur jerbs!” Lol maybe don’t leave your home? What a bitch"

Typically yeddi stance I don't know anything about the CM but he doesn't seem particularly happy or relaxed despite being in the presence of cat. Seems like he fed the cat milk.

They treat fellow hindus like shit & then tell us to be afraid of non-Hindus. Authorities should have let those assholes starve rather then send them home twice a day. 

But chances are the authorities are also casteist fucktards. Sooner or late if they are infected, Covid-19 will take them away. Grade A idiots. Sounds like they would take corona from one of their own made up equal level castes than take food cooked by a dalit.

Karma has a way. Harijans continue to be disrespected, even in 2020 AD. Meanwhile, in UP.... Better give them a dalit doctor if they get coronavirus And then we ask why do we have reservations.

There still is a huge section of society that still do not accept people from  some casts/section of society as human beings. Might not be the best solution to uplift the suppressed classes, but that's what we have right now. You must be fucking kidding me Gaand phate to phate par jaatiwaad na ghate I love this statement

But two of them told me they wouldn’t eat something touched by a Dalit. I have no problem with them, as all those who support me and those who oppose, belong to my own village. I informed the officers over the phone No news coming out of UP surprises me now. How do they not see the irony?

They are 'untouchable' themselves right now? I thought they would finally be able to see what it feels like to be shunned because of something that is not in your control. That they would consign their families to the same fate rather than upgrade their empathy circuits hurts my brain so much... If this is true then WTH man.

804,Food,"A banner in Delhi requesting people not to leave, food and accommodation will be arranged by Delhi Government",https://i.redd.it/4wy2vgsjvtp41.jpg,," I was initially surprised by the exodus of workers. But many interviews have clarified their thinking on the situation and I think it's quite valid. Basically, they're worried that if they fall ill, they have no support net in these city slums. Back home, they at least have family members to take care of them.

Given that politicians often have (or claim to have) their ears to the ground, they should have been aware of this insecurity. I think in hindsight it was better to announce a schedule for the lockdown a few days earlier, transfer funds to their accounts, run maximum number of trains and buses to take everybody back home, let people prepare and stock up, and then start the police curfew lathi raj. Instead, under the excuse of ""preventing panic"", they started with the last first, and now people can neither stay in cities nor go back to their homes, neither have food nor money. *“Recall the face of the poorest and weakest man you have seen, and  ask yourself if this step you contemplate is going to be any use to  him.”*     

 ―        Mahatma Gandhi The worst thing is he has been asking people for staying back for a number of days now.  Still, the anti-kejriwal propoganda is too high in UP right now I don't think Modi has consulted with state heads before declaring the lock-down and given them some time to prepare or listen to them which could have avoided mass exodus from cities like Delhi. This guy literally enforces ""Na khaunga, Na khane dunga"" - he won't prepare and won't allow other able leaders to prepare at state level. Jokes on Kejri 

Fun story - I was in an auto once at 4 am and the guy keeps asking me sir ye board padho. 
I asked him after reading 4 boards, bhaiyaa aapko chasma hai? 
He replied sir padh pata to ye na chalata Does anyone know if state CMs were told that there would be a lockdown beforehand? Kejriwal, he is such a good man to be a CM. He is gonna win next election too. He did tons of good things for poor and medium class families. Source: Sent by a friend

Everything is so unfair. Man killing themselves for 70k loan. Woman with 10rs and a new born baby.
 I don't know what to say. Lock down must be lifted for ""Rural India"" with STRICT ENTRY AND EXIT checks. One thing need to be investigated.

Poor people and MGNREGA workers are saying they didn't get any fund, But govt. is coming up with huge claims. Now my problem is, if the poor people not getting fund then where is all the money is going.

Currently journalists and investigators are at minimum since they can't go out. But this need to be investigated so that we can get the full picture and proofs.  

ok, this lockdown was a good thing, has given everybody time to process and the next steps etc etc.

But why the eff would u extend it, we can't be doing this for perpetuity???! have a partial lockdown yes, i.e cinemas closed, malls, public services etc taking in less than 30% of the capacity with extended times, allowing only ppl with masks, and similar setup with offices or work from home . That would be the way to go for sure.

Not extreme lockdowns coz this virus is here to stay, and just by locking things down we ain't gonna cure it, but instead, we will destroy the economy for good, ppl will lose their jobs, food won't be available, ppl with ailments can't do anything about it, mental health and the list goes on.

so I really cant understand why the majority of randia are pro lockdown extension for perpetuity??/ have you guys thought this through or are u all sitting nice and comfy in your dads apartment or villa playing ps4 all through the day and cant really feel the heat of this extreme measure ?

at the end of the day nobody wants the cure to be worse than the disease right ?? Somehow the rich, who have decided on this lockdown, are convinced that the poor only need food and that is something we can easily manage. 

I am probably one of the least affected by this decision, but I was also born piss poor, without a functioning toilet, and this is a hard hitting decision on majority of the downtrodden in India. 

I am being called a pariah in my circle as well as a hypocrite, but this thing has not only highlighted the divide, it has bloody cemented it further. 

A lot of poor kids who will miss school are never going back. A lot of jobs will simply disappear. 

This was a selfish act of self-preservation by people - politicians who are all above a certain age and are the most susceptible to the virus, and not only poor, even MSME sector is going to feel it, if they haven't started to already. 

A lockdown is a decision of a fool - it is a not a decision of a functioning democracy. You never let the wheels of production halt, especially in a country like ours - it is harder to start a fire than to keep the fire going.

I think that was rant enough. No offense but I think they had more chance of surviving without lockdown, considering the mortality rate whereas me sitting in my room eating kurkar and Chola bhatura daily, playing video games on my 1600$ laptop and 20Mbps laptop :( Sab changa si [deleted]"

Logic and family values have broken down,obviously. Haven't read the article but want to point out an experience I had. Maharashtra apart from their major cities has really terrible roads and villages that go dozens of kilometres from these roads. There were no government buildings there but it seems like they had just recently gotten electricity (thanks to gov or whoever did that). It's a stark contrast to what I have experienced in gujarat where I have complained for roads being terrible but they were 100x better than what I experienced there. This lead to a large difference in lifestyles of villages of similar size and comparable resources. My point is, A road can change a lot. I have had a bit of comparable experience in madhya pradesh too. Maybe it was an isolated experience where I found the worse in the bunch but as they say a chain is as strong as it's weakest link.

&#x200B;

>There is no evidence that choice of food will make any difference in the spread of the virus. Food is certainly not the source of transmission.

Kerala: feels good to hear about the steps they have taken Haha as long as there's good connectivity, I'm fine. I saw the press con. It was really smartly played, if people of the state work together then it's easy to stop its contagion. Multiple warnings are issued to people who haven't yet gotten tested. And, the charts released are a big help too. Smartly the first priority is identifying the victims, and while identification takes place the government works on the secondary issues such as bandwidth, food etc. Gotta say I was impressed. Who would have thought a communist party will be so good under a democracy Meanwhile in Delhi - no work from home for lazy and dishonest citizens! Commies just doing what Govts are supposed to do.

Is there a way to tactfully tell them when I've had enough food? The last thing I want to do is disrespect their generosity!"," Welcome to Indian kitchens. This is universal, and the only way out of this is to insist you are full when you have a lil bit of space left. This way you can eat their final serving, and continue to flatten your curve as well, so to speak.

Edit: Do bring in a dessert sometime. Return the favour! Indian families generally insist on serving more food until you INSIST you are full. It’s a cultural thing. 

In older days people were shy to ask more food being guests. This was understood by the host. The hosts, hence tend to feed them more assuming the guest is shy. 

These days people are generally very forthcoming (especially in American culture I observe that people are honest and absolute with what they want and how much they want). But sometimes, being hosts, they err on the side of caution to ensure the guest is satisfied. Just insist that you are full politely and say, you have reached your capacity. They will usually understand.

Another thing to do is, hold your palm facing the ground over the plate, to block the food and just insist more telling you are full. This gesture is an accepted gesture in various gatherings.

Thank them for the food and appreciate the cooking so that they know you are satisfied. 

Hope this helps. Oh boy...I have some good tips for you..

1) eat slow
2) when you are done, quickly put the bits that have fallen through the edges back into the plate...so the plate becomes unservable
3) just get up and wash your hands when done ....no eye contact. 


Tried and tested in the field.
P.S: all techniques tested on my wife's family where I face the same issue. I am fasting today. Typical Indian household lol. It's endearing in a way but tbh I always feel like I can't walk or that I am going to throw up.

Just insist that you are full and just ask small quantities of different varieties of food. It wont be that bad once they are used to have you around during lunchtime and get familiar with your portion sizes. Just eat real slow, they will get it that you are having trouble finishing it. Tell them that you will ask if you want more, or that you will take the food by yourself when you want more (e.g tell them “you guys also eat, I’ll take how much ever I want, I don’t want to trouble you”) . Eat slow to match speed of others eating in the house. Or tell that if you eat a lot, you will end up feeling ill. Initially Smile and after 2-3 times, tell politely but firmly with semi-serious face. Many years ago, a fellow American friend I knew in Dilli consumed an entire stick of butter out of politeness. The cultural norm is that as a guest, if you actually do want to be served more food, you only refuse ***mildly.*** Guests will usually not directly say - ""Yes, I do want more"". Instead they will just not protest too strongly when the hosts are serving you more food. So, when you actually do become full and definitely don't want more, you have to politely but very firmly say no. You have to insist, like one of the other comments said. Don't worry, it's not rude. Another tip is - eat slowly. If you finish too fast, they'll think you're still hungry. Why do you think most Indians have a potbelly and are generally unfit? I don't understand what it is with Parents and relatives that they will always put more than you need in your plate and think that its healthy to eat more while it's clearly not. My diet always gets screwed because of my parents overfeeding me even if I refuse to eat more. They just put more on the plate and I have to eat because I don't like wasting food. I need to be more stern otherwise I have to spend more time with my dumbells to shed those extra carbs. Refusing food is not rude unless you do it rudely an option is to tell them that because of the coronavirus thing you have started a special diet as you have more time or to enhance your health something. You may have to skip lunch entirely though. Fast for a day I'd say it's better to say you're full, since it works like a charm for me. TBH it's my family hence I don't get pushed too often. It is typical of many families to insist one more portion to ensure even the meek leave with full tummy. Some hosts keep on feeding even if they might not have sufficient for themselves. They also believe that 

The way you’d refuse - once you have eaten to your liking, say that you liked it so much that you already are full to your heart’s content and do not have room for more. Say you don’t shy from food and if needed you’ll ask for more by yourself (say this in a jolly tone). Also, as others have said, physically block them from serving another portion by holding your hand slightly above your plate or bowl. That’s an accepted way of saying you don’t want more. Tell them you have an upset stomach. That's what I do! Something I do, but only if people are very insistent: I yank my plate off the table and protect it with my hand until the other person retreats.

&#x200B;

This absolute last resort, but if your plate isn’t there, they can’t serve you. you should say that you are following very strict diet plan. Relax. It's just culture. You have to refuse lovingly, three or four times before they'll stop asking. Tell them you had something to eat already somewhere else. say you have allergies. Keep passing comments like,

* today the food is a little oily

* salt is less in the food today

* I think the gravy stinks, was it yesterday's dish you recycled?

* Roti could've been softer

*  Daal at the house next door at Sharma's is tastier


if they still offer you food. Quit

edit: Clearly this is being taken as a serious comment. I was in the mood to shit post. My bad. Take but don't eat. I know its not good to waste food but it's perhaps the only way. Ensure that the food gets wasted by may be mixing curries with staple, half eating sweets etc. When they ask you, say you are full and can't eat anymore. They will still continue giving excessive food to you for a few days. But then they will start paying heed to your words gradually.

> New Delhi:

> From videos advising people not to follow social distancing rules to those suggesting Muslims are immune to coronavirus, the Delhi Police say they have uncovered a concerted misinformation campaign that poses a serious challenge to the government's efforts to contain the ongoing pandemic.

> In an investigation of the content being shared on WhatsApp and apps like TikTok in the first week of the nationwide lockdown, the Delhi Police said they have found many of the videos specifically targeting the Muslim community by quoting religious text and leaders.

> An analysis of more than 30,000 videos on the social networking over the last five days found that most of the fake information and posts are created in Hindi and Urdu for a specific audience, the police said.

> The videos were analysed by the police with the help of security researchers, fact checkers and data analysts and a report on the digital investigation has been accessed by NDTV. According to early estimates, more than 1 crore people have already seen these videos, suggesting a high degree of circulation and impact.

> ""Several of these videos appear to be shot in Pakistan and Middle East but audio in Hindi has been superimposed to make it look like its shot in India,"" the 22-page report, which the Delhi Police has shared with various intelligence agencies, says.

> ""Our analysis has revealed an alarming number of videos are being shared advising Muslims not to practice social distancing and several suggesting that coronavirus does not kill Muslims,"" a senior police official said.

> According to him, the analysis also revealed a pattern in dissemination of misinformation.

> ""While analysing the origins and sources of these videos, it was observed that several of the accounts which originally created them are being deleted regularly after the content goes viral to hide its origin,"" he said.

> ""Considering the fact that most of these videos have been created with professional video editing software, being viralled (sic) on social media platforms, original uploader accounts being deleted, and certain accounts peddling fake news among Muslims are promoting Pakistani religious leaders with terror links. A further investigation into the likely role of foreign actors needs to be investigated,"" the report says.

> According to the investigation, Chinese-owned video sharing app TikTok is the most preferred medium for creating and spreading videos with religious instigations against health advisories and fake information regarding the coronavirus. These videos are further being shared on WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter.

> Videos of Muslims refusing to get themselves tested and beating medical personnel were being spread and others were also being encouraged to do the same, the report says.

> Religious texts are being quoted to not stop shaking hands and people are being encouraged to go to their religious shrines even during lockdown, it adds.

> Authorities have expressed concern about the impact of these videos amid attacks on medical personnel like in Madhya Pradesh's Indore this week and the emergence of a cluster in Delhi because of a gathering held by a Muslim missionary group last month that has spawned dozens of cases across the country.

> In the investigation into the Delhi congregation, the police are looking into a sermon allegedly by the chief cleric of the group Tablighi Jamaat that termed the directions of doctors as ""a conspiracy to keep Muslims away from fellow Muslims"".

> Since then, Maulana Saad Kandhalvi has officially issued an audio message to his followers asking them to cooperate with the government to fight the disease.

> ""We have to take precautions, follow the guidance of the doctors and give full support to the government such as not crowding into places. This is not against the principles of Islam,"" he said.

> While at around 2,000 cases and 53 deaths, the spread of coronavirus in India is far more limited than in Europe and the US, health experts have warned that the numbers could surge across the country if the contagion takes root. https://www.altnews.in/old-unrelated-video-shared-as-muslims-licking-utensils-to-spread-coronavirus-infection/

From the article :


>On searching Google with the keywords ‘Muslims licking plates’, we came across the same video on Vimeo, uploaded on 31 July 2018 by a user called Asghar Vasanwala. According to the description of the video, the people seen in the video are Dawoodi Bohras, who are licking the utensils in an attempt to follow their belief of zero wastage of food


>Furthermore, the website of the Dawoodi Bohras states that they follow a tradition of eating meals on a steel ‘thaal’, which is designed to accommodate a group of 8 or 9 people. They also strictly follow a policy of no wastage of food - “Bohras have a no-wastage policy so not a single morsel should be left on the thaal when it is taken away”. Wait till those guys see the water used in Pani Puris ...Covid 19 is a virus that hopefully would be cured  .. Communal hatred  is deep-rooted in India  ..ain't no cure for that  shit .. A friend of mine who hasn't messaged me in months randomly sent me one of these videos and said take care, because of these people we will all get sick. We need to do something about them. Its utter bullshit. I'm a Brahmin Hindu, and I know my kin well--they'll find any germ- or health-related excuse they can to fuck over Muslims. Very important question. These could be staged, doctored or old, or it could be new and true. What's disturbing is that many people aren't interested in verifying the sources, and a question like yours assumes you support that kind of behavior and is in denial of ""the truth"". But given the extent of hatred and division across the country, it is the question to ask. Goes against the agenda though There is another video circulating where a fruit seller appears to be licking his fingers as he rearranges fruits in his cart.

But throwing your children in a river is not an act of a normal person in normal circumstances. Either she was unstable or the dire circumstances made her so. We as a society have failed somewhere for not providing the social support for such kids at the very least.

I checked swiggy, some restaurants are providing safety standards while making order , I am really wondering how safe it is to order from Zomato and swiggy.?"," it's safe as long as you didn't came in direct contact with the delivery person and your food is properly cooked Dude. Learn to cook if you have stove or induction. 

Seriously, it is an essential life skill and you also have time at hand. YouTube and experiment the hell out of it. It is not that hard. Throw out the container the food comes in asap and wash your hands , don’t let the container touch anything in your house 

Reheat the food in a microwave or a tawa for a few mins I had pizza about a week ago (after eating at home for nearly a month) from a local pizza place. The delivery guy wore gloves but I removed the pizza from its box anyway, put it in a home container, binned the box, washed my hands well, and ate the most goddamn delicious pizza of my life. FML or YOLO, only time will tell. I would err against ordering food from outside. This is strictly a hypothesis and feel free to disprove it. 

With restaurant sales plummeting I wouldn't trust the ingredients used to be fresh. These are also times when businesses have to cut corners to survive and where would a restaurant cut corners? In the ingredients. With the free movements in get supply also highly constrained, I would also assume that the meat supply to be not so fresh. If a restaurant doesn't have a high turnaround then it's fair to expect the food to be stale. In this case I would expect it to be the same. Corona wouldn't spread but you wouldn't want a bad case of giardia or typhoid as well. Order them and reheat the food for a minute just to be safe How safe is it to order meat from these restaurants? I'm craving to eat some chicken or mutton or beef. But worried about stale meat.

Inb4 comments saying the virus doesn't spread through meat - yes. I know that. I'm only worried about stale meat since I'm not sure from where the restaurants are buying. It would be safe but just take extra precautions.
Also, if you have groceries and utensils try to learn some basic recipes. [deleted] I am here living on boiled rice for meals and roasted ground nuts for breakfast EVERY DAY.  Restored to use different spices every day just to make the same thing fresh.  My entire joint are annoyed with this and they want vegetables,meat and fish. The food package may have been touched by atleast 3-4 people so it's better not to order anything for a 2 months or smthng if possible buy some slice bread, bananas, peanut butter, rice and dhal

add some peanut butter to the maggi and try it with oatmeal also

also add banana to oatmeal

make banana, peanut butter, sandwich

if you got a pressure cooker combine 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 cup rice, 1 cup dhal, and 6 cups filter water on low heat for about 1 hour To be extra safe, empty out the food into your containers, throw the disposable containers, wash your hands and reheat the food. Opt for contactless delivery. Or, you can ask delivery guy to leave for pack with your building security (if you have that option). You have to go down and pick it up. 

I have been ordering food for this entire lockdown. Paper surface is not conducive to virus spread. Just make sure you tip delivery guy generously. 50 is norm. It's safe if you follow the following precautions. After you take the packet, take the food out on a clean plate. Then put the food in the microwave for 2 minutes. Throw away the packets while the food is heating, then wash your hands properly. 

Don't order online if you are not going to able to heat the food at home Just don't come in contact with delivery person and if you have gloves wear them while taking the order take food out as soon as possible and throw the containers."

For people like me living alone away from home, it is a nightmare."," They should be allowed , food delivery is exempted from lockdown as essential services.  

Im  sure that  the local police are misreading the instructions It's functional in my locality but only 70 restaurants are operational. Usually, it's around 700 on normal days.

Edit: [Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/vhYCbvT) Yea that's strange, but hopefully they'll be back online soon. Hyderabadi here, swiggy Zomato has not been properly functioning since last week

Restaurants barely active on them and the ones that are  active usually cancel.

Today I was surprised to see more restaurants active in Swiggy near my area and decided to try my luck. 

Delivery executive did not get assigned even after an hour so I thought I'll cancel. But their support is not available hence I just left it aside and had homemade lunch. To my surprise an hour later it got delivered so gonna have that at dinner I guess I ordered food on Zomato. The delivery guy called up to say that the police aren't allowing him to deliver.

Either I'll become super skinny or be dead by the end of this lockdown. Cops are retarded It's because the police of india will beat the shit out of everyone who's on the road, no questions asked.

[one such incident](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fooy8o/delivery_guys_carrying_orders_beaten_up/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) It's just not profitable for restaurants to be kept open with dine-in banned. Without them open, these food delivery apps can't do much. Exempted doesn't mean they've to mandatorily function.   
Restaurants are still open for takeaway and you can go and pick stuff up. [removed]"

Homepage on the app is also being [redirected to Zomato](https://i.imgur.com/aNR6irw.png).

Zomato is giving 50% off on next three orders and 3 months Zomato Gold trial if you click on ""Go to Zomato"" from [UberEats app.](https://i.imgur.com/WtfGw3H.png) (Thanks to u/JPBabuaFromOttawa) This sucks because Uber Eats is the only service that never messed up my order and always gave me a refund when they were at fault.

I at least will continue not ordering from Zomato. I've had delivery drivers literally go missing with my food, or they'll give me a completely wrong order, and then refuse to refund anything. Worst of all, if this happens after midnight, other places in my area close down and the only thing I'll get to have for dinner that day is a dozen servings of ""Sorry sir, apologies for the inconvenience.""

It doesn't happen all the time, but when it does it really sucks and they're incredibly unhelpful. I've paid for 2 or 3 orders worth 500+ bucks where I never saw the food before I stopped using Zomato except for Gold when eating out. Aye, This breaks my heart!

I was loyal customer of Uber eats since like start of 2018! At least in my area Uber eats was the best. 

Good offers, timely delivery and great customer service!

Godspeed Uber Eats, You will be missed... 😭 Sucks for international travelers who would only have Uber on their phones Uber Eats was better than Zomato  . 

They had better offers , better delivery, better service 

Zomato is still a lil clumpy and I don't think this is good for consumers as it can result in Monopoly...

Lets hope Swiggy ups the game fuck man! Uber eats was my favourite with all the discounts! Zomato is the worst! now only Swiggy remains

RIP 19 rs orders, 39 rs orders, 59 rs orders.. will miss them! Going to miss those outrageous discounts compared to zomato and swiggy Hope the employees and delivery guys are not fired. RIP Uber Eats. For me, it was always  Uber Eats> Swiggy> Zomato [deleted] Ubereats was a saving grace for me back in college when it had just begun in Chennai. Guess all the undercuts bit them in their ass Well, this paves a much cleaner way for Amazon to enter the market and if that happens, Zomato would be their first kill in my opinion.
 Zomato has horrendous customer service while Amazon has one of the best ( in my opinion) Uber Eats failed to read the Indian market in food delivery. 

They focused on app design rather than adding more quality restaurants. I liked to use their app but it simply never had as many options as Swiggy or Zomato. 

For now, Swiggy remains to be the best app for food delivery. Bummer for me because I always felt customer service was better in Uber eats.

Also gave great offers which I think might have led to losses and ultimately the sale to Zomato This is sad! I ordered twice from Ubereats yesterday. Didn't know this would happen when I woke up. :/ My last Uber Eats order was just day before yesterday, they had massive subway offers all the time, overall their offers were much better and extremely professional when it came to delivery and handling, but I'd agree 80% of my orders were from swiggy and zomato. There were a few exclusive places in UE which I used order from because of offers and quality food. I guess those listings would get merged now. Oh crap Ubereats was really good and cheap compared to both rivals. I walk to the restaurant. That way, you'll get your order faster in Bangalore. So now the final war is between swiggy and Zomato? Zomato offers are nothing but adjustment and rounding off This is happening everywhere in the world. Deliveroo recently closed down in Germany, selling everything to the last remaining competition Lieferando, one of the shittiest delivery services. 

At least you have 2 options in India. Some places have only one! this i one news that has zero impact to me. i neither have ubereats, nor zomato, nor swiggy. i feel that these apps exploit the producers of food and are causing a lot of damage to the restaurant industry. i prefer to visit a restaurant, talk to the owner/staff, get to know then and i enjoy my meal more than an order in. This is why the free market sucks. Duopoly now and the customer gets screwed Thanks Uber eats for the memories Khana khau ki bc apps download karu? Zomato ate uber eats Man, this sucks. Uber Eats had great offers and seemed affordable compared to the other two. Also, their customer service was miles ahead of others, at least for me. Zomato still owes me ₹130 I think. Pretty weird why they did it. It was a dead company. The user base was overlapping. For 3 50 million dollars, they have not acquired anything ground breaking. Its just waste of precious money. It will be duopoly as it is other sectors too. More discounts on the way! Very bad Uber bhuko ka sasta sahara Investors - wait for the dip and buy $UBER. They got 10% stake in swiggy and zomato from a loss making segment which now also means more customers to swiggy and zomato. Does it mean uber ears will not be a part of my uber app? Zomato eats Uber Eats! I'm sticking to my pledge to never order cooked food from such apps. I either cook my food or go out for a nice dinner at a restaurant. Not gonna get into the habit of outsourcing 'cooking' food for myself. Quick question: Why was it an all-stock transaction and not a cash or partially cash transaction?
 I mean, imo, cash transaction is better than all-stock transaction in terms of operational freedom and profit sharing. Remember Letsbuy guys? Softbank pressure all around All these complaints against zomato are very surprising to me. I have never used Uber Eats and I believe you all who are saying good things. But zomato never messed up any order, and their delivery guys are pretty good. I always go back & forth between zomato & swiggy and choose the one giving a better deal. Swiggy has given me 1 or 2 mess ups but zomato never. F

Wish they sold it to Swiggy atleast. RIP uber eats This is why you go eat then & there, problem solved!
Just gotta use those at night sometimes tho."
831,Food,So this happened with my food delivery,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fuw9ha/so_this_happened_with_my_food_delivery/,"Today I ordered some food from swiggy. Order status was showing Delivery executive collected food and is on the way but from tracking his bike was showing off the route and it got delayed by 10-15 min so I called executive and he said he is on the way and will meet me in 2 min my apartment gate. I thought maybe some GPS tracking issue.

I went to gate to collect but he did not show up, so I called him and he again said within 2 min he will be there.

Finally he delivered food, When I checked gravy I found quantity was less than usual (50%). Also some gravy was over the package. I immediately felt something is fishy. I suspect that he took away some part of food.

I opened app and checked for help but to my surprise order status was still not showing delivered. I could not report the case.

After waiting for while I cancelled order from my end to get refund and got 100% back.

I was waiting for call from the delivery guy or swiggy but there is no call so far (more than hour now).

I dont think swiggy is at fault here and I am also not 100% sure with my suspicion. 

What do you think of it guys ?

TLDR : Order got delivered late, I suspect food was taken away, No confirmation of order deliverey, had to cancel myself despite receiving package. Got refund but feel something is fishy."," I would say please don't place the accusation with Swiggy unless you're 100% sure the delivery executive did something fishy.  
I had my Zomato order delayed last week, app showed him at the same place for a long time. Was getting annoyed because the Pizza would go cold and the restaurant was hardly 5 minutes away. When I called him he said he was delivering double orders due to the lock down. When I probed further, he revealed that the other order was placed for one address, but the customer asked him to deliver to another which was far off. When the executive refused saying he'll be penalized for going off route, they insisted he come there and they'd pay him 30 or 40 bucks. Being the naive fellow he was, he's gone there for the money and guess what, they've given him 10 bucks. When he expressed his disappointment, they've attempted to assault him. He was pretty shaken up. I told him not to worry and come to my place. Tipped him well and I was even more sad because the guy was very young. I learnt not to act hastily without empathy. He was likely hoping that you cancel the order. 
I have also heard of people taking the order ans asking delivery guy to not mark it as delivered and instead cancelling the order. 
This I heard from a ex delivery guy. All safety standards down the toilet. Post on social media to raise awareness. had a similar incident yesterday, where the app showed that the order was delivered when it wasn't.

reported it and got a refund. It's possible that police may be stopping the delivery guys at every barricade ??"
832,Food,How do I politely turn down food in India?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fr02ak/how_do_i_politely_turn_down_food_in_india/,"Hey Reddit!

My boyfriend is from India and I am American.
He’s told me that in India, it’s rude to refuse food, and that hosts will often push you to eat more than you might otherwise need/want.

The problem is that I am recovering from an eating disorder and it’s really important for me that I listen to my fullness cues otherwise I’m super prone to relapse. 

It’s also troubling because many members of his family are overweight and I am really nervous at the thought of visiting them and being pressured to eat more than I am comfortable with.

I want to enjoy my time and also not feel pressured to overeat, while not coming across as rude.

How can I politely refuse food if I am full? Is it really as impossible to do so politely as my boyfriend has made it seem? Thanks!"," ""Aaj mera upwas hain""

Just learn this phrase Feel free to refuse. A lot of Indians don’t understand boundaries and therefore it’s upto you to have one.  It's a little frustrating, to be honest. I understand what you're trying to express, I used to be in a similar state by being an overeater/emotional overeater. Especially when my mom or aunts would pour in more food in my plate than required. You could do a couple things depending on how close you are with them.

1. You could express yourself, and open yourself to them, so they wouldn't push you any further 
2. Pretend to be ""full"" before you actually are, so when they do stuff your plate with more foods, you don't feel sick. 
Or. 
3. As soon as you're done, you run to the kitchen to leave your plate. (Wouldn't really just that, but the idea was somewhat funny.)

Hope it helps! Besides, if they care for you, (as we try to show our affection by feeding others), they'd understand what you're going through and wouldn't be offended. 

Hope this helps! Tell them you are allergic to  carbs and vegetable oil. 

big chunk of options  will be taken off the shelf . One trick that works for me is: say you are full well before you are. They will push to eat some more, refuse it a couple of times and then have it :) Things not to do in life:

>Visit India when you are recovering from an eating disorder.

None of the advice people giving you on this sub will work when you are gonna see so much Delicious stuff and you would want to try each and every one of those. 

> How can I politely refuse food if I am full? 

You start saying ""I'm full"" when you have eaten 50% of what you want to eat! Just say ""Ewww"" at hit the hand holding the plate. ^/s Just say that you are stuffed and mentioned that you loved it. Usually works. I don’t smoke so whenever somebody offers or forces me a cigarette, I say “I just had one before coming here” haha Simple and short. Stay drama free. Put your foot down and say ""No, THANK YOU!""

Stay drama free and simple. Repeat
Say ""No, Thank You"" Arre nahi aunty pet bhar gaya aur nahi kha sakhti 

Sach main aunty pet full ho gaya. 


Isse teen chaar bar bol dijye. Tell them you or on a fast. Simple as that  just ask for a glass of water when they offer food

It works out for me Just say 'pehle aap lijiye'. Just say that you had a very late previous meal. For eg, if you're invited over dinner, tell them that you had a very late lunch. nahi chahiye ji. any karl rock fans up in this bitch?"
833,Food,This is a picture of Reliance’s Corporate Parks food court,https://i.redd.it/j0c6b2xci9e41.jpg,," I am an employee at Reliance and I have been harassed multiple times for bringing chicken or fish in my lunch box. Employers have no business monitoring their employees tiffin boxes. 
[It started way back in 2013.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/naazneenkarmali/2013/12/16/mukesh-ambanis-reliance-retail-chickens-out-turns-vegetarian/#29b88bf548df) TCS Bangalore does not serve non veg in its food courts. Funnily only in Bangalore offices for some reason I work in Anil's reliance's campus in Navi Mumbai for a client company. It is the same there. You cannot eat non veg on your desk either. People still eat non veg in campus though but you have to be careful not be seen by security. There is a hospital in Bandra, Mumbai frequented by celebs which doesn’t allow staff or patients to bring non-veg food inside. The security opens staff’s (esp nurses) lunch boxes and inspects your food! The restaurants and canteens inside are obviously ‘pure’ veg. Lmao, reminds of the time in elementary school when my classmates used to bully me for bringing chicken nuggets on Tuesdays. I worked in a school where majority Gujaratis sent their kids. One of the Koli (fishing community) kids used to be badly bullied and left alone for lunch because she brought chicken. She used to cry everyday. When I told the principal about this and how we should be teaching children acceptance she said that the parents would stop donating and pull kids out of the school so they couldn’t do anything. I ate lunch with that girl almost everyday instead. India hasn't moved on from the 1800's, it seems. No eggs? Brahminism and capitalism are best friends Corporate -Hindu Nexus is the rot of this country All weworks are veg too. Why no objection to that?

Ref:

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/13/wework-meat-events-expense-ban [deleted] It's private place. They have all rights to frame such rules.
Think of those minority like Jains or others who don't eat non-veg. It causes them be discomfort sitting in same area where non-veg is served or is being eaten. This is fine with me.  I guess the rest of the food court is strictly non-veg. Vegetarianism is obviously the right choice, but it still has to be a 'choice'. Dhokla Dhokla everywhere I'm about to join Reliance corporate park . Can I PM you for some questions please ? BJP ka vote yahaan gintey nahi hai, Thokey jaatey hain! From what I heard from employees in Reliance Jio, there are dedicated inspectors who roam in the building to check if anybody is eating nonveg. And they've even fired some ppl, solely for this reason! It is also worth mentioning that they didn’t give a holiday on Christmas. I don't care what you eat at home but in my premises I will absolutely enforce food regulations. Why? Because it's my property and there are smells I like and dislike.

As long as the shareholders of Reliance (or whichever subsidiary) agreed to this policy, I don't see anything wrong with it. Many employees must be dying due to malnutrition. So sad."

Me: Not really but it's one of our favorite dish.

Agent: Are you a Christian?
Me: Hindu

Me: Umm it's very common I don't find anything wrong with that.

Agent: The other day I saw a kerala guy selling beef and he had photos of God in his shop. 
Me: hmmmmmm.


I then went home and ate the beef fry, ordering it again tonight. So good."," with the way things are right now, i'm surprised he didn't spit on your food and deliver it to you. I've only eaten beef this one time and it nearly killed me. 

The meat was nice, the lynchers on the other hand not so much. I'm a mostly-vegetarian Hindu who can eat meat if there is no veggie alternative, or if said alternative has been had three times in a row. There's only so much salad I can do. This isn't for moral reasons; not having grown up eating meat means that the taste and texture are still alien to me. But I defend the practice of meat eating to my conservative friends and family. I tell them to (a) stop being hypocritical and (b) learn about other Hindus in India. 

I point to their and their children's leather shoes and ask whether the cow voluntarily donated its skin, and whether it continued to live after they were well shod. 

I point to the fact that of the top six exporters of beef in the world, three are Hindus. What do they feel about it? 

Millions of Hindus visit the Kullu Dusshera festival, where animals are sacrificed and the meat is eaten as prasad. The head priest of the Hidimba temple does the sacrifice. 

Some of their favourite BJP politicians wear leather shoes, and some, such as Sangit Som (one of the most vicious anti-beef proponents) have owned meat-exporting companies. Overall, beef  exports have risen under the Modi regime. DM me your best place to order beef from For an average Keralite beef with beef is a cultural shock. Its also very strange when peope talk of steak as the go to beef dish. Jesus Christ That is why I don't feel comfortable ordering off Zomato or anywhere else cause I feel like they are quitely judging my food choice but then again I am wayy to lazy to make my own food 😂😂 so Zomato it is It's just ignorance. Imagine if you saw someone ordering something like an octopus. You would be surprised at it, not necessarily in a malicious way, but just because it's not common and is generally considered taboo. You're lucky that the guy wasn't more aggressive.

However, I think it's the responsibility of the companies to train their employees not to judge people or make comments about their choices. Was the Delivery person from Zomato or Jomato? 
If Zomato surprising, if Jomato then Bhaiyya checks out. I drink alcohol and almost every time I drink 'socially' somebody will ask/tell ""you are a muslim, you are not allowed to"". We are inherently nosy. Judgemental people, I don't see that changing any time soon. As long as nobody gets hurt , I am fine. Looks like this guy was genuinely curious, rather than judgemental and accusing.  If yes, you might have missed a golden opportunity to convert a *bhakt* into a normal human being. He needs to be educated on how people choices when it comes to food shouldn't be an issue 

For education  is something that fight against ignorance Isn't basically all beef in India buffalo meat? I never understood this business. I've been having beef in India all my life, but I've never seen ""cow meat"" being sold. It's been always buffalo meat. I can't say that it's true for entire country. But the chances of cow meat in India being sold is still pretty low. Should have asked him, why they are selling it. I also cooked beef today and I am a Brahmin from WB. Beef Pasanda Zindabaad! Get this delivery guy's name and tweet this conversation to Zomato senior management. Even if they dont hold an enquiry, it will stop other delivery fellows from nosing into the habits of their customers. The shaming and violence aspect comes from casteism. This is completely different from the choice based vegan movement in the west. Hi. I am part of Zomato's marketing team. Can you please share the order ID with me so that the concerned team can look into this at the earliest? Thanks. Don't yOu bELive iN gOd???? You should report him to Zomato. It's not his job to question your food choices Freedom of food. I don't mean this in a condescending way but why should the delivery people even know what you're ordering? That's your and restaurant's business. we indians are too much worried about others Nepal is quite a Hindu country as well. Nepalese/Hindus eat beef like crazy, not cow though. I just don't happen to understand us, the Hindus of India. Be careful bro. Better go to a restaurant and eat rather than getting it delivered by brainwashed Sanghis. Just call customer care and get him fired. So now u got beef with zomato. Yesn't. Fuck them. This kind of stuff reduces my belief in ..religions. What you did was wrong and you should not do that again. Instead, eat the beef in front of the delivery boy. r/ThatHappened TIL people converse with zomato guys. You need to report this. This shouldn't be encouraged. Post it on Twitter or something. This is not something to be encouraged. The poison is spreading fast. I hope you raised a complaint against the scumbag. Which restaurant? I want to buy it. From where did you order? I mean people should realise it’s possible to be Hindu and eat beef! Beef eating was a well-kept secret and none of my extended family knows. Even now when I live in a different country I keep it a secret around my Indian (Hindu) friends because they are religious and won't be able to handle it. u/Beers_and_Cheers_ Report him to Zomato if they do have such an option. Its absolutely none of his fucking business to talk to customers about their food & this should not be encouraged. That idiot might even assault future customers. Be very careful about ordering Beef online. I remember that during the Gujarat riots these attackers had a list of people who were seen around beef stores in the old city. They attacked any beef eater. Please avoid ordering beef online. OP, what are good beef places to order from in Bangalore? send the email transcript to the ceo? People like him need some training You didn't offer him a bite? that's bad :D Why do I feel this story was written like the way r/indianpeoplequora posts are? Vegetarians, vegans and Hindu fanatics don't understand the freedom of choice. Like bro its my choice to consume what I want you shouldn't poke your nose in it.

Likewise its the cattle farmers decision whether to sell its meat or sell milk or use it for farming or whatever other uses the animal provides. Next time ask for a discount because you are a Hindu ordering beef 


:) r/thathappened I'm pretty conflicted about the beef issue

On the one hand I'm all for freedom of choice. At the same time, I'm under no delusion that eating beef - or any other meat - is a benevolent act.

Eating beef becomes even more problematic when you consider the environmental impact of raising beef cattle

I really don't know what side to go with this issue. Freedom or environmental benevolence? Screenshot pls... Am regular user of Zomato, never had to chat to any ""agent"" I don’t think that was bad, he was just curious might help open his mind as long as he was aggressive or threatening. It's your food choice and you are free to eat what ever. However, from an environmental perspective eating beef is a poor choice, because you know the belching that a cow and water buffalo produces and all that methane causes green house effect. As an atheist and vegetarian I am okay with people eating beef as long as they don't mind people eating dog meat . Sounds soooo fake, but ok Screenshot or it didn't happen."

How can people survive without food

838,Food,"[Food] Dinner last night.. Fish fried with a crust of dry peanut chutney, served with herb and rice, and conout milk gravy",https://i.redd.it/eostfukqbfk41.jpg,,"  Recipe for Fish:

* Take a white fish and fillet it.
* Brush the side with beaten eggs
* Sprinkle peanut chutney on it. Press lightly to ensure it sticks on the fish. (Refer peanut chutney details at end of comment)
* flip over and apply eggwash and then chutney sprinkle on it
* Fry 2 mins per side on a pan which is on medium heat

Recipe for rice:

* Cook rice as you normally do (I used a rice cooker).
* After rice is done, mix in chopped fresh herbs ( I used oregano and basil)

Recipe for coconut milk gravy:

* In a sauce pan saute chopped onions till they turn translucent. Use oil with a high smoking point or ghee.
* Add in chopped tomatoes and mix
* add spices (salt as per taste, red chilli powder 1/2 tbsp, turmeric powder 1 tsp, garam masala 1/2tbsp, coriander powder 1/2 tbsp, and asafoetida 1 tsp.)
* mix spices and wait for oil to be released.
* add 1 can of coconut milk and mix.
* bring to boil on high heat. reduce heat and let simmer for 3-5 mins.

Plating:

* Use the rice to create a bed/foundation layer
* place fried fish
* use a ladle or spoon to pour gravy on the sides of the rice (like a moat)
* garnish with micro greens or chopped herbs.

Peanut Chutney:

Typically you can purchase dry peanut chutney in indian stores. I have used what is known as 'Shengdana chi chutney' (chutney of groudnuts) commonly used in maharashtra with vada pav. You can make it at as follows at home:

* Take peanuts/ground nuts and dry roast them on medium heat till they turn brown
* peel off any remaining skin
* pound the peanuts in a mortar and pestle along with diced garlic, red chilli powder, cumin seeds, and salt. I use 1/3rd cup of garlic cloves, 1 tbsp red chilli powder, 1 tsp cumin seeds, and 2 sprinkles of salt for 1 cup of peanuts.
* You can use a food processor as well, but it will make it a fine powder. mortar and pestle will need some elbow grease but will give a more granular texture. That looks fantastic! It's got me in the mood for a second lunch Rice looks a bit overcooked or is it broken rice? I've never heard of using peanut as a coating but I do love peanut chutney. Thanks for the idea! Looks like KFF I think you had too much water in rice while cooking Not a huge fan of fried fish (why make a healthy thing unhealthy), but this looks good. Why bro...why?? Please don't post beautiful pictures of food. I'm dying of frustration (and hunger too). Kon hai ye MasterChef? Kyun post karte ho aisi dishes jo main sapne me bhi na bana paun? Looks so delicious.  

Would omit the oregano myself, but it appears you've used it judiciously. We have beef!!! Whats the point, the fish isn't deboned. This is really a sight for sore eyes in this sub. That aside, I love the colours."
839,Food,Here is a list of food items to stocked up in case of lockdown.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fmx87q/here_is_a_list_of_food_items_to_stocked_up_in/,"Many people are staying away from home and was dependent on hotel, tiffin services. Here is a list of things you should stock up in case you need to cook. 

1- The list of spices 

Garam masala, Dhaniya powder, jeera powder(optional), sabji masala, Kali mirch powder (you can also buy whole kali mirch), Haldi powder, red chilli powder, garlic paste.

2) Oils-  Mustard oil, refined oil, ghee and butter.

3) Rice, pulses (moong, arhar and chana), wheat, besan, suji, dosa batter. 

4) Canned foods like Jam, peanut butter, mayonnaise, cheese. 

5) Eggs

6) Buy powder milk like everyday or tetra pack of Amul milk if you enjoy tea. 

7) Vegetables like onion, garlic, potato, sweet potato, tomato,reddish, Shimla mirch can last for sometime but keep them in open container. 

8) Apart from noodles also buy macroni and pasta. Smith and Jones pasta masala is good.

9) Fruits like orange, apple and pomegranate can last a few week.

10) sugar, you can also buy ""gud"" or ""misri"" which can be use as alternate. 

I have little knowledge about other places food so keep adding to the list. Go to a good YT channel and learn how to cook because even if this shit don't last long, cooking is an important life skill."," Another point, do not eat too much if all you going to do is watch TV or read papers. How does milk powder work? You mix it in water and you get something similar to milk? So much Chakhna and No Alcohol? Good Samaritan. Good list but I disagree with Smith And Jones part."
840,Food,Australians trapped in India's coronavirus lockdown fear running out of food and water,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/28/australians-trapped-in-indias-coronavirus-lockdown-fear-running-out-of-food-and-water,," I have no sympathy for them when they are not more disadvantaged than an average Indian. 

But an average Indian currently in Australia is much worse off than an aussie. 

While many less wealthy countries are doing the right thing, Australia is doing its best not to look after the temporary residents saying that they are only visa holders. So government has no responsibility. 

In contrast to this, all foreigners in Portugal with pending applications will be treated as permanent residents from Monday until at least July 1, this ensures migrants have access to public services during the corona virus outbreak. 

Applicants including asylum seekers need only provide evidence of an ongoing request to qualify, granting them access to the national health service, welfare benefits, etc. Temporary residents in Australia are not even covered by national health insurance scheme and beleive me many don't have health insurance. 


Our own temporary visa holders in Australia won't be getting any benefit from their government. While Aussie citizens and PR holders will be entitled to receive benefits, many people on visas even those who pay the same amount of tax and are as disadvantaged by the situation, will now be asked to fend for themselves.

Meanwhile when it affects their own citizens all the rules go out of the window, for example recently Australian government allowed all international students to work unlimited hours as opposed to normally allowed 20 hours a week, as long as they are working in supermarkets stocking shelves for Aussies.

I am hearing news from smaller towns and cities for example Adelaide, where some Indian groceries are helping students giving free rations as many have lost their casual jobs.

On top of that, many people who came to India on bridging visas which has condition to return back within 3 months, Australian government has placed travel restrictions for 6 months, yes it only applied to temporary visas. Doesn't matter if you are living there from last 5-10 years. 

Now these people are stuck in India and many have lost their dream of getting residency, what's worse is they can't even go back to settle their affairs and sell their belongings, say their goodbyes. The government refuses to extend the deadline on their entry due to no fault of their own because they are visa holders and not Australians.

I can go on and on with the list........."

Besides, it is stupid to have an MSP for grain and rice, and nothing for the crores of vegetable, fruit and pulses growers. It is criminal. 

I am not usually a supporter of privatization, but this is a PSU that needs to go ASAP. Give it to companies like BigBasket or Swiggy. They'll do a better job at a cheaper rate and create more jobs.

Updating as he's speaking

1. Consider this as a curfew - Modi
2. This will be a 3-week lockdown...
3. As per experts -If we are not able to control it in 3 weeks, we will have to pay a huge price for this.
4. 1 infected guy can infect hundreds in less than a week as per the experts and initially, you won't be able to detect any symptoms.
5. Italy and America have world-class facilities still they were not able to stop it from spreading.
6. From their experience we can learn that there is only one way to cope with this Virus, We have to stay at home ""no matter what happens"", Practice Social Distancing.
7. Don't cross that Laxman-Rekha, break the chain.
8. Our current actions will decide the fate of our country.
9. ""Jaan hai toh Jahan hai""
10. If we won't behave in these 21 days of lockdown, it could result into a setback of 21 years.
11. Pray and appreciate the efforts of those Ambulance drivers, nurses, doctors who are working for us and sanitizing our localities.
12. Appreciate the efforts of the security forces who are away from their families and they have to deal with our rude behavior sometimes.
13. WHO, Medical experts are guiding us and the Central Government is taking appropriate steps to cope with this issue.
14. INR 15,000 Crore allocated to improve our medical infrastructure.
15. Medical and Paramedical training will be provided.
16. Healthcare will be the first priority of every state from now on.
17. Please don't pay attention to fake news.
18. PLEASE Don't take any medicines before you consult any doctor at any cost, it could be fatal.
19. Take care of your family, The only way we can get through this is by maintaining this lockdown
20. Please follow all the rules and guidelines given out by WHO and Central Government.

\--End of Speech-- (Now correcting if I put anything wrong here, although I'm sure I didn't miss anything)

Tl:DR

1. Social distancing is the only way to fight this.
2. 21 days will decide our fate.
3. Whole country under Lockdown (consider it a curfew only) until 14th April (21 days)
4. ALL ESSENTIAL SERVICES WILL REMAIN FUNCTIONAL. [deleted] Actually appreciate what the government is doing. Lots of western countries with much better health care systems have been lax and look what has happened. Really regretting not getting my hair cut last weekend... Glad that India is taking seriously. Hopefully the government has contingency plans in place for daily wage labourers and others who can't survive without working. My father is undergoing second chemotherapy tomorrow, not sure what is happening.

Guys I am scared.

Edit: the main issue is no shops were open in Chandigarh, Mohali area where the medicine required for the chemo is being sold. They are not even answering the phones. We were hoping on tomorrow but now I am wondering if those medical stores will be open.

[These](https://i.imgur.com/WaWnKtE.jpg) are the two [medicines](https://i.imgur.com/1uvYI2K.jpg).


Edit 2: Had a call with one of the dealers, he says the shop (selling the required medicines, situated in Sector 11 Chandigarh) will be open by 0900 tomorrow. God bless this country especially the poor.

Edit 3: [UPDATE : March 25]

ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ

Yeah boys, we got the medicine today, though one of the salt iv solution were not available (from one brand).

Yesterday, one of the redditor in the oncology field advised to use the same medicine from a different brand.

Our doctor confirmed this too.

So we bought that medicine drug and everything went smooth from there on.

My mother and I are so relieved, thank you for so many replies, suggestions and support. You guys rock

Probably should mention the situation in Chandigarh, we did notice that people are rushing towards medical stores like every other general essential services and there were long queues of people there.

I do feel, proper system framework is required to enforce this curfew. If people weren't hoarding shit before, they sure as hell will now.

Needs to go into the nitty gritty. Everybody already gets the big picture. My friend is undergoing Radiation therapy for her stage 3 cancer.   
I've been accompanying her to the hospital and back, have our own hired car.   
I hope this doesn't become an issue. Just returned from market. Purchased medicines,veggies ,fruits. Thanks God How do ""Essential services will remain open"" and ""Total ban on stepping out, forget what going out meant"" go together? Even if the grocery stores are open, what is the procedure to go out?

There is an urgent need to clarify this. Its utterly chaotic around my neighbourhood. Which countries are dealing with coronavirus in the best way possible? Home ministry to give detailed report on the exemptions soon. Food? Vegetables? Medicine?

>Letter from MHA regarding lock down and list of essential services.

Hope it clears all the doubts I might be agreeing with the man for the first time Will food delivery work? Exactly what steps are being done for essential services? I'm not stocked for 21 fucking days! Good speech. No theatrics. On point. Laid bare the threat, and announced strict but necessary measures. DD News Live Link, rewind a bit to see PM Modi's Speech with English Subs

https://youtu.be/EaOsJRru-YQ #Jaan hai toh jahaan hai Why didn't he say anything about groceries and medicines? That is literally the first thing I am worried about.

Edit : I saw PMs tweet. Wish he had said it in his speech. I am also skeptical as to how this is going to work. And  am hopeful it won’t be like demonetisation where there was no planning for implementation. Fingers crossed! Nice. He's saying don't listen to rumors and fake news. Only take meds that are approved by doctors. Hope these cow dung aficionados are listening to this. [deleted] Shouldn't we declare national emergency, so people can relax on bank emi's, rent, electricity bills etc. What does this mean? We can't go out for even essential services? Man, it feels good to be finally agreeing with our Prime Minister on something. I am not understanding what lockdown means, will we be able to buy Groceries and things like that because our current stock will last just 4 more days I think. If yes, then anyone could possibly walk around and say they are out to buy groceries.

Will there be any sort of punishment for those caught roaming freely? If yes, then on what basis ? Essential supplies are going to be available. [Please do not panic. Please.](https://twitter.com/narendramodi/status/1242476408896507910?s=19) Hope people don't draw a line with lakshman rekha (pesticide) on their doors to keep the virus at bay from tomorrow. Who know we may see some WhatsApp message like the rohini nakshatra one. Good luck Indian friends, respect from Chile how do we get essentials now? big names like grofers/bigbasket are not delivering, we can't even go out. One thing I find disconcerting is the lack of transparency and finer details regarding a lot of things. There are no clear guidelines on how and when the people in isolation or quarantine are going to be tested/treated or discharged.

Then regarding the essential supplies. It's not clear what all is available and can be bought and from where. And what about the supplies from the government to the people who need it the most.

Hope there would be clarity regarding these things in the coming times. Dont panic and purchase a lot guys kirana shop and pharmacy and milk shop are always open My family has a seasonal business. This is gonna fuck shit up this year for us. Happened with GST and we were finally recovering this year. Fml. https://imgur.com/a/K23PvpJ

Detailed order.


P.s. It's a great read tbh. My Grandfather is bedridden and is on life support i need protein powder which won't available till tomorrow he can't eat on his own he will starve my god i am so scared they were run out in all the shops...

Also all veggies are sold on gaadi..so no veggies? i am confused and 3 week complete lockdown? food runs out what then? what happens if some building water supply breaks..?

Also people don't really care about social distancing no one is following it fuck this could be it. I'm all up for this, but what do I do about pet supplies? I need cat litter for my cats.

Edit: What's with thr downvotes, I'm genuinely asking. What if someone's pet needs food and stuff? This is a tricky situation. My dad is stuck in his posting. He can't come back home. He is alone and will have to manage everything himself now. Cooking and stuff. Hope he stays alright Lockdown has been initiated. It's a thing we really needed and I'm glad that this shit will finally be taken seriously by people. I just hoped he would have been clear about the essential supplies as people are swarming to stores right now. They are scared, and I empathize with them because people get afraid. PM should have emphasized that people should not go out now. Now, because of the crowding, there will so many more people who will get infected. I expect cases to rise even more now, because of this.

Another thing that should be done ASAP is **educating the goddamn cops with what are essential goods and not to just laathi charge people going to buy vegetables or medicines.** Sure, beat the shit of people loitering or taking selfies of empty roads but for fucks sake, stop harassing people who are out buying essentials. An acquaintance of mine was not only hit by cops but was given a lecture as to why he didn't stock up on vegetables earlier. Do these dense idiots not realize vegetables don't last very long?

Also, please don't forget your pets. Buy food for them when you're picking up supplies for yourself.

I hope we get through this. Best of luck everyone. Goodbye guys. It was nice knowing you all. Finally!!! Now that this has started, I want to ask how can we help the poorest of the people in the country. People who earn 100-200 rupees per day and will go hungry or be under huge amount of debt if they can't work for a few days. Are there any NGOs we can donate to that can help such people with food and essentials during these times. 

Lock down will have to continue past April 15 for the virus to be completely contained but a very good start. Let's take it one step at a time. If people cooperate and the state provides the hospitals with enough medical supplies, we can come out of this pretty come summer. Fingers crossed. I wish he had emphasised in his speech that essential services would remain open. People went beserk and started rushing out and hoarding food to prepare for the lockdown which was unnecessary  Yesterday, I commented on this thread that I am having to go to the hospital during this lockdown on weekdays. My friend (from Nodia, WB) is presently living with us (Kolkata, WB) for her Stage 3 cancer treatment at Tata Memorial Hospital, New Town, Kolkata. Her radiation will be going on for 28 days, Monday to Friday.

We have hired a car. We carry papers and ID (including patient ID) and even have a signboard on the car saying that it's going to the hospital. Today, while we were inside the hospital, our driver was beaten up by the cops at the parking lot, just in the same way you guys are seeing in the videos that are being shared online. He stated the reason why he was there. The cops did not contact us or anything, he was simply beaten up.

This is anarchy.

I am not on social media other than Reddit and I do not intend to be because of how unreasonable people are in general. However, I would like to inform you all that certain cops are beating up people, whether they have a reason to or not. They are not communicating at all. We are trying our best to find out which police personnel exactly did this and take the relevant legal steps after the lockdown is lifted. I do not think that the police have orders to beat up anyone they wish to.

I would also like you all to warn others. And if you or any person you know is presently deployed to police the roads during the lockdown, kindly let us know what rules/instructions you have. Because today, it seemed like you have none. Nagma from ndtv just said that their studio is already getting pictures of people gathering in numbers and panic buying groceries. Shit is fucked up. Does this mean people will scramble to shops between now at midnight?

If doing it for hoarding, these four hours might do more damage. Let's hope this doesn't gets extended beyond 21 days [deleted] * There is a huge population of India which is dependent on day to day daily wages to survive . A 21 day lockdown pretty much screws them over badly . Now ,  I know many state governments have announced relief measures and central government is going to continue MGNREGA , but we all know the track record of the governments with their welfare schemes , especially in such a short time period .


* There is also a significant population of India who have been at the receiving end of this government's discriminatory policies . Many of them have 0 trust in the government ( I am not making a moral judgement ,I am just stating a fact ) . 



* The government's track record with previous such moves hasn't been really good . Demonetization was a train wreck . Article 370 was similarly a train wreck . GST was a disaster despite years of preparation  . Now we are supposed to believe that the various government will effectively pull off all necessary arrangements for this lockdown in a matter of few days ?


* 21 days of lockdown won't defeat coronavirus . It will return with a vengeance . The only way of dealing with it is mass societal awareness and changing our behaviour permanently . This 21 days lockdown will be useless if it creates a false sense of security and people just go back to their old habits Petrol pumps in Pune have been closed for private vehicles since yesterday, even though they are covered under essential services during this lockdown. If groceries, milk and medicines are not available nearby, how is one supposed to travel? What if there is a health emergency and need for visiting hospitals? Other alternate modes of transport are already banned or stopped..and now we cannot even use our own vehicles?! This is fked up..and starting to feel as if the ‘cure’ is worse than the problem.This also gives an example of how local authorities (Collector, in this case) can override orders from the Union Ministry of Home Affairs. Much needed decision.
We need to break that process!!! [deleted] Banks also shut? People crowded the grocery shops nearby my place, I wanted to buy some stuffs but I noped out seeing the crowd. Probably will check tomorrow morning if any stock left in those shops. :/ Railway has been ordered to make beds for quarantine/hospitals work has begun. I don't have much to be tensed about this lockdown but I am thinking of the poor who depend on their daily wages to eat. It's a check mate move 
Only time will tell if it's for economic or  virus For three weeks. Honestly, I'm happy they're taking this so seriously. Now just tell his own party members to stop taking out fucking processions. Absolute genius. He’s just saved thousands of lives. He had the balls to do what Trump did not. 

He said - “I understand that the lockdown will have an economic impact, but right now my first priority is the lives of Indian citizens.” What happens to the poor? Needs immediate cash transfer so they can stock things. I'm afraid deaths due to hunger and poverty will cross Corona. My dad's a doctor and will need to travel. How can we ensure that he doesn't get hit by a danda? Today I've seen videos of police beating up people in cars, bikes even before asking them what they're doing out there. These videos are from the chowk just outside my house. I'm so scared for my dad right now, he's 60, there's the risk of the actual fucking coronavirus and then the police brutality going on. Medical professional here. The heathcare professionals who are supposed to look after you, the citizens, can only do what they can with the supplies they are given. Most of the doctors do not have masks or any protection equipment for themselves. Especially in govt. Hospitals. We have to buy our own. The hospital administrations of govt. hospitals are corrupted. They wouldn't equip the casuality sect. of the hospital properly in normal times but are trying to do better in these testing times. 

Please do your part and stay home. 

Lot of people are roaming recklessly on the streets. These are the same people who, when they get infected, would come to hospital and complain that they are not being treated like royalty. India is a country with 1 doctor for 1500 people. We do not have enough masks and ventilators available for a crisis. Please understand. 
People who are complaing about getting bored while staying home- think about all the people who do not have the same luxury as you - all the health care professionals, delivery people, police , army, DAILY WAGE WORKERS. Stop being a prick and thank your luck that you are not out there battling this. 

PLEASE DO YOUR PART AND STAY HOME. People here in Bengaluru (Kormangala) are swarming shops and grabbing on to anything they can find. Total fucking chaos here. I am just worried about the stray animals! I hope the Gov will feed them till the lockdown so no one gets out to feed them! This is a very essential move I support it completely! Where's my free pornhub subscription. This lockdown means nothing if we aren't testing extensively to find most, if not all, of the infected cases. And yet, people crowded markets today wanting to buy flowers and fruits to celebrate Ugadi. :( It's literally a Rest in Home or Rest in Peace situation. Wow no water supply as well. Govt. says don't die of Coronavirus, but hunger and thirst. Every mofo who labeled anyone a fear-monger for sounding the warning bells here on Reddit and elsewhere can go fuck themselves.

Sanity has prevailed. Thank god for that. Need to ration my essentials and consume less food. It's saying essential goods will be available, does that include groceries?? Govt listed E-Commerce under the list of exceptions, during the lockdown period, to deliver all essentials like food, medicine and groceries. 

But Amazon Pantry, Big basket, Swiggy stores, grofers, dunzo, etc have all stopped taking orders. 

Police are beating up delivery executives on roads. Ye madarchod HIV hi thik tha, jo pelta tha vo hi jelta tha 4 weeks from tonight here in NZ. Welcome fellow isolationists! [""Keep the laathi away, please don't beat the delivery boys"": K Ganesh, Promoter, BigBasket, Fresh Menu.](https://twitter.com/ndtv/status/1242766640132919296) How insensitive can one get 🤬

These are difficult times & what he is carrying only essential supplies, right? 

Why should he be beaten black & blue like he is some criminal 😞

Indian police, you can do better. 

#Covid19Out #Lockdown21 #lockdown 

https://twitter.com/santoshspeed/status/1242819959387914241?s=19 Should have assured people on how essentials are gonna be delivered. I can be really fucking anti-modi but the actions the Modi government is taking to fight the coronavirus are really appreciable (apart from the clapping shit but again that can be excused as a way to encourage the doctors and make them feel good about it). So yeah I am kinda proud of India rn. [removed] No mention who the government is going to take care of the poor. Day labourers don't have savings to survive 21 days without work. If COVID-19 isn't going to kill them, starvation will. At the state level, other than Kerala and Delhi, no other state is stepping up. 

Is there any plan out there for the poor? Lmao when modi picked the poster up, he indirectly wanted to say that the country is full of a bunch of morons. bachho ki tarah samjhana padh raha hai inko. Sir, that's all okay. What about the people who depend on their daily wages? And about essential services? Homeless people? What are the daily wage workers gonna do man? This is necessary but I wonder what they'll eat? I shit you not, as soon as I heard complete lockdown from 12 AM I took my scooter and ran to the market. It was completely deserted, and the most famous grocery store of the entire fucking city had its shutter down, but was operating from insides, probably packing orders for people who sent them lists. I had to plead to him to give me 2kg almonds, which he did, and I sighed in relief. If we were gonna go on lockdown at 12, shouldn't he have preponed the address to say, morning? Given us time to stock up on food, medicines for 21 days. It’s fucking happening !!! Alexa play Dooriyan hai zaarori Anyone who's loved ones still have to go to work? How do you guys feel? My mom works in BSNL so she has to go and my dad is scared shitless that she might catch the virus. :/ So main question. How are we supposed to go out and get groceries? I know the shops will be open, but there's no guarantee that police won't lathi charge us even if we tell them we are going to buy groceries.   
Will online retail groceries still deliver? Heard that Reliance is going all out, does this apply to their grocery retail stores too? Will they assure us deliveries for the whole month? ALSO, This might happen in the coming days.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.ladbible.com/news/news-italian-leader-warns-police-with-flamethrowers-will-enforce-lockdown-20200324.amp.html And the people flocking to grocery stores as if there is no tomorrow, while possibly spreading the infection. When if this is what he intended, he's doing a bangup job! Bhai people are panic buying now, the whole point is dead BC sabko condoms free me baaton, population ka bhi dhyan rakh liyo bhai.. They should also put hold on rent, education loans and mortages. This could help a lot of people who work on the frontline. Why not the same thing can be said earlier like before noon or in afternoon.

Why does this guy chose 8 pm for every such announcement This shit is going to spread like wildfire through the slums of India. I think India is going to be have the largest death toll. So many humans packed butts to nuts. How can you get 1.3 billion people, many of whom are extremely poor and just scraping by day to day, comply? Will e-commerce like amazon and Flipkart be still working? no layer masks selling for 50rs.
3layers costing more
N95 unknown brands for 400rs.
I contacted employee of supermarket chains easyday+more and both said they have shut shops till 31st march. Shutters were down. No grocery shop opened. Saw crowd at one shop and the guy said he's selling products at his own risk. The same said by chemists. Thankfully chemist shops near govt. hospital showed much confidence in their operation. 

Shop owners are waiting for ""Pass"" from local jurisdiction to start operating legally. 

Right now Governments are spreading the virus by their no planned hasty moves. >Supporting a govt decision during crisis does not mean one should stop critical thinking process. A thought lockdown would lead to groupthink & thus sub-optimal decisions. So, indulge me as I pose some questions as to whether a 21 day lock-down is feasible or even desirable?

https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1242779897384198144.html On TV, rickshaw drivers cycling home from Delhi to Bihar. That's about 1,000 km. Others are walking home. Homeless shelters are packed. 
And the govt has nothing to say, no plan.

https://twitter.com/samar11/status/1242823667664351232?s=19 THOUSANDS have collected at shelter homes where Delhi govt has directed cooked food be provided. Overcrowded, overwhelmed- shelters don’t have adequate ration & infrastructure. Govt needs to ensure cooked food distribution at all anganwadis & govt schools also #21daylockdown

https://twitter.com/AnjaliB_/status/1242777027763003393?s=19 Why he always does this, come 4-5 hours before midnight and does something that creates panic? Because of this, there are lines in front of ration shops.

But we all should appreciate what he did as it is good for us. 

We all should follow this.

All the best everyone for the next 21 days. For 21 days Making my youtube debut with how to gain 21kgs in 21 days. Thank you PM Saab. Guys, the pornhub logo has changed to stayhome-hub logo today... did anyone notice? Given the seriousness of coronavirus this might be required. The problem though is how do people get their essentials?

I have stopped going out of my house and ordering using bigbasket. But guess what, yesterday Karnataka implemented Sec. 144 and rumor is that Bigbasket delivery people were beaten by the police because they are not classified as essential service. So Bigbasket cancelled all the deliveries.

Couple of nearby grocery shops are slowly running out of items. Talking to them it seems that the wholesaler vehicles are not delivering items. No bread, no drinking water, no biscuits. Nothing being delivered.

Now PM comes online and just throws out 21 days lockdown without outlining the big problem - How are people going to get groceries? State governments will have guidelines is not good enough. He should outlined some steps.

People in my locality are in full on panic mode. People climbing over each other to get stuff giving a middle finger to social distancing. He is afraid of  ""if all religious people go away..who the hell will vote for me"". Am I the only one who thinks PM should have made this announcement a few days earlier? People could have used these few days to stock up and not create chaos. Instead, he gave the bartan/bhaanda speech and sent confusing signals about Govt action plan. You have to agree , when this man knows shit's serious , he can use that charisma expertly . Not his biggest fan but I really respect and appreciated his view and action on this serious matter . For 21 days! Big decision! Big balls But what about the bills? How are people living paycheque to paycheque supposed to pay bills? They should put a hold on that too I appreciate the nice picture ITCell rustled up using clipart. A delayed decision but a good one nevertheless.

Also, should have given a longer window instead of just 3-4 hours. This is exactly what happened during demo that sent everybody into a frenzy. People in my neighbourhood are out on the streets and panicking. 

A decision this big for a country of 1.3 billion should not have been taken at such a short notice. Why wasn't this announced today morning? I'm all for a lockdown and I appreciate the decision; the execution and timeliness—not so much. What a Royal mess.

This one night after the speech is enough to spread the virus far beyond control in India. Ok, he did almost everything properly.

Wasn't clear about essential services 🤦‍♂️ Guys I'm scared. We don't have rations to live for 21 days. Wtf are we supposed to do? This sucks for the daily wage labourers, everyone puts out a fruit/vegetable cart, momos stall and so on. Also for seasonal businesses. Can't do anything to earn money. Much needed, the people of this country don't take anything seriously if not forced. What about ecommerce services and the internet?

Ecommerce will single handedly reduce the load and stress on all the grocery stores and medical shops out there.

It will also SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE an insane amount of people from gathering together and also help them live peacefully inside of their homes knowing fully well that people can deliver them essential goods.

Another thing is the internet. The entire IT industry is dependent on this.

Refusing these classes of workers who are majorly contributing to this country's infrastructure is an absolute must. What about daily wage workers ? What about EMIs, rent and interest payments ? I am fucking scared! I stay away from my native. in fact 800kms. i stay with 3 more people but thought that everything will be closed just makes me feel sick already. Cant go out. 

&#x200B;

Can we still buy food/grocery etc from tomorrow?  I just stepped out to buy some fruits and saw long queue at all the open shops. Cant blame people if they're hoarding either since this is more of a fight or flight response. We have enough aata. We still going out to get some, in case someone in our extended circle needs in emergency. I like this initiative, it was necessary. However what hated like was there was no clarity over whether groceries/pharmacies will be open. The exemptions for lockdown will be same as an the day of janata curfew. 21 days to develop a habit #Don't forget about your pets!!

If you are stocking up on food for yourself then your dogs/cats/pets neeed food too!! Get pedigree/cat-food/pet supplies and their medicines too! Don't forget them!! What happens to dabbawalas? Will meal delivery services continue? should have done this since 15 but okay not too late yet Good to know I've got three books left to read. Nice little vacation to get over the backlog. Good decision and glad he talked in layman's language. Hope people understand the 21 years setback thing and take this seriously now. Minsitry of Home Affairs issued a guideline for essential services

[https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1242476674710560770?s=20](https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1242476674710560770?s=20) Does this mean ALL offices that do not come under essential services will be forced to close? Or does it still depend on the office and their owners to decide?

Also does insurance companies come under essential services? [Lockdown Guidelines](https://imgur.com/a/Oy4ZN50), what's open and what's not. After last times 8pm taali bajao scene, I thought this time would be something similar. But damn! I was wrong. >cigarette shops will be closed

Oh fuck me. It's sad that even after this people still roam the streets Bhai maggi milegi ki nahi? people in my neigbourhood are partying. i cant even Hey guys my mom is in India right now. Her flight to come back was the 30th. Do you think she will have to wait out the lockdown? The prime minister is holding a Q&A session live right now. 50% salary cuts in my company. Don’t know how I’m gonna survive the next month. Modiji listening to experts. Much love. WTF, Not even one line about essential services like vegetables, grocery? What to do? How are people who live off of daily wages supposed to survive? Pay rent? Everyone is supposed to dip into their savings but there are people who don’t have any.

Edit: i think this is the right time for Rahul Gandhi to preach about his NYAY scheme on tv (basic income for the poor) so it picks up steam. Many countries are doing the basic income thing. He should have taken questions from journalists like every other democratically elected leader is doing. My maasi's neighbor started crying after hearing his speech today. This is the kind of followers this guy has, he just needs to put it to good use. Good. But khayenge kya? thank god no more clapping n thali banging को - कोई

रो - रोड पे

ना - ना निकले i really want to know how tf am i gonna get food? if  there is a 21 days lockdown guys I live in Gurgaon and I  have parents in Agra who are alone, I really want to be with them  any way I can drive from Gurgaon to Agra during the lockdown? Time to shed the corona news and just chill, work and do some exercise. There is so much news coming from all the directions that it's overwhelming. Let's just take a step back and reflect on life, spend some time with families and hope this passes soon. The panic buying itself will result in a explosive burst of this virus.

People!! Chill the F out. Can we move from one place to another by foot as I'm fucked if I can't. Can any lawyer explain if this ""lockdown"" has any legal basis? As in, under central law. Or do the states and territories need to give it a legal basis? Mujhe koi bata sakta hai how do i pay my EMIs and credit card bills which ends up to 1lac per month.
If business are closed how do one earn that much money i am scared if this lockdown extends fir kya hoga banks will be go crazy. 2 speeches imploring people for self isolation and social distancing. Both resulting in hordes of people coming out on the streets to do the exact opposite. Incredible oratory, incredible communication. As a Pakistani, good move by your PM. Hopefully medicinal supplies and food gets delivered to those most in need This was what we needed. People need to respect the guidelines and stop with all the panic. 21 days. Lets pray for India. If you guys have listened to the announcement he says to stay at home ..and then says essential services will be working. Now how the hell should i stay at home and buy essential goods? Crowd toh udhar bhi hoga na ? Modi announced a 21 day lockdown. Did he announce a plan to take care of daily wage earners? No.

India's poor fear that hunger will kill them before Corona virus

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-52002734 **Essential services (Medicine, Food, Dairy and Water) will be available. Please do not crowd the local stores!!!!** First direct as is speech from Modi. Gave it as it is. 

&#x200B;

This was much needed. Concerned for medicine / Grocery but im sure the planners arent that stupid and accounted for it.

&#x200B;

Stay indoor Nibbas, EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE Anyone know what's happening with international flights? Messed up announcement. Who announces curfew from midnight to cause much chaos and shit. I hate Modi Ultimatums. His ""Mujhe 30 din dijiye"" spelled disaster to the economy. 

I am giving him 21 days, I will follow all the guidelines for the sake of myself and my family but I just dont trust him anymore. To those panicking, this was just step 1. I'm sure more clarifications will come over the next few days. He has already stated that essential services will remain open and they have allocated 15000 crores to improve our medical infrastructure. 

We're a democracy of over a billion people and no one in Modi's or our generation has ever faced something like this before. Every decision needs to be taken carefully. And so far this government has done everything right. They just showed that when push comes to shove, they can get their act together. 

I'm going to remain optimistic and say we're in safe hands for now. They have done their part, now it's out turn to do ours. When it wad time to prepare, Modi ji was welcoming Trump. Health Minister was saying Situation Under Control.

Lavda mera under control GHARO ME PYAAR BADEGA A good step. Hoping the tests are carried out widely too which is not happening as of now and hence the cases are low in our country. It's probably the one of the few times I appreciate the man's sensibility of the issue. 
I really hope everyone stays home. 

**PLEASE GHAR PE BAITHO**

**PLEASE SIT AT HOME**

**कृपया घर के अंदर बैठे रहें** It's a tough decision but maybe a strong one. Also some insight on how people are going to get essentials is important, hope the state govts come up with this too. Govt should arrange home delivery for groceries and cooked food from restaurants for maximum effectiveness. Govt can hire the daily wagers currently jobless due to lockdown for this purpose. dont think this is the right moment to ask this but, can anyone with experience tell me if booze and cigarettes will be available. The planet smiles :) This cascaded fast! From voluntary stay at home to curfew. Should have done a better job of pacing so people could stock up on essentials. I m already running out of food from 2 days of staying home. If I have to choose between starvation and corona, bring on the corona. Finally. Kudos to the government for taking the right step! Here is hoping we come out stronger on the other side Conspiracy theory

Modi will call off lockdown in two weeks. And then say “woah - see I stopped this” I appreciate this move very much, though I'm anti-BJP go corona, go corona. corona go! corona  go! go corona, go corona. Its interesting that the post about the 21 day curfew on r/news has been locked. There are some retarded comments (from both Indians and non Indians) so I guess that's justified They can't monitor every single street, ally, and building across India. Large groups will still gather. And if they get caught, the cops will be paid off. Plus.... where do all the homeless go? I've nothing to eat at home. I didn't hoard or i did panic buying and i'm the one put at disadvantage now. Seriously, He always does this gallery exhibition without any preparation or clarity. Ok, serious question: Why should I NOT start hoarding rice/wheat/oil/dal like crazy from today?

Not that I'm gonna do that but people I know will have to be reasoned with. And please don't say""fo it for others etc"" nobody gives a shit about others now. lets start #21daysreadingchallenge Ram Navami will be silent. The chaitra navratri will be joyless.  
We misused his name. We did evil in his name. We profited from his name.  
-This is his curse. The gods are angry.  
-We were chanting Jai Shri Ram like a mob slogan.  
-We should have been preparing for the healthcare emergency.  
-Instead, we were throwing stones and hate on the streets.  
We should have been united in the fight against his virus.  
Instead we were taking Lord Ram's name in anger.  
And pitting brother against brother on the streets.  
        
Lord Ram is angry. This is his curse. We must heed this. I'm shocked he never said a thing about how Essential supplies like Grocery and Milk and all that will be provided for the entire duration of the lockdown.

A simple 'We are looking into it' is simply not enough. I ordered an XS Max during clearance sale from Amazon. Anyone knows what happens to that? Not shipped yet. [removed] ELI5 how the lockdown is going to be effective if you are going to let people come out everyday to buy food? Too little, too late, too incompetent.

 In a country where close to 20 crore people go to sleep hungry everyday, the government shows exceptional faith in the ability of the common man to procure 21 days worth of ration in 4 hours. 

This nostalgia inducing move is enough to make people think about who are these “saathis” that the Prime Minister keeps on talking about. Is she the woman that was asked to vacate due to her hostel being turned into an emergency ward? Is he the man that was beaten up by on the way to get milk and then paraded on the media for the same?  Or is she the doctor, and also a mother of 2, who was harassed so much by the police that  she was forced to eat lunch in her ward even though her home was a five minute drive away. All of these three are people that I personally know, but may soon become a mould into which your near and dear may fall into, in the next three weeks.

It is perhaps futile to comment or criticise anything because all constructive opinions are these days seen as sedition and anti-establishment, when presented to anyone capable of turning things around. Even the media has turned into a repetitive show of a lover showering praises on his beloved, who can do and say no wrong. 

We’re already behind, and I must plead everyone reading this to proactively getting tested. Every plea and recommendation by the government is coming a week late, and as the educated populace we should be looking to take steps before they become do or die situations. It will be inconvenient, but the moment it is possible, please get yourself tested. Assuming of course, that we don’t have the same deficit of testing machinery as we do now. 

I do have the following questions, and it’ll be indebted to anyone who can answer them

1. What steps have been taken to ensure there is not blacket marketing and profiteering
2. Why is there a need for a separate “Corona War Chest”? How much of it will be funded using the money that would normally be used to run services like the railways? What part of it will have to be a bill that the common man will foot. 
3. Would valuable guidance on how to procure groceries in these trying times have taken too much air time? 
4. How do the authorities plan to differentiate between law breakers and people who are as desperate to get back home as they are to stay out?
5. Will I also be beaten up, made to wear placards, and my photo circulated on various platforms if I go to fetch groceries while both my parents are on duty? 

I write this not in my capacity as a dissenter or a critic. I’m writing this, standing in the shoes of someone who has both his guardians in the medical service. An incredibly small yet significant population which, if you haven't already guessed is incredibly stressed and at-risk. The same population who when, or if, this ends will need a regimen of drugs twice as long as compared to symptomatic patients. 

And for anyone who needs to read this : Just because you have a badge doesn’t mean you can treat people any way you like, and as a law enforcement ~~officer~~ personnel, you have an obligation to be more ethically upstanding than the average man, not less. Modi speeches: Creating havoc since 2016!! [deleted] What did he mean when he said ""the cycle of coronavirus is of 21 days""?What does a cycle mean? Someone send pyaaz Will general stores remain open? [Apparently essentials will be given leeway](https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1242469980165140480?s=19) What does this lockdown mean? Will essentials be available? Just what we needed. But hopefully people follow it and not be stupid. People will suffer but it's a necessary step. What’s the situation in the mail services, specifically international mail?

I have a package coming from India to Texas and I’m worried about it now.

Can anyone give any insight? So health and sanitation is considered essential services. Does that only mean the government workers in these departments, or does that also include other contractors who work inside apartments and other places? 

I mean, what do I do with my trash bin tomorrow morning? Jesus I hope people won't panic and create chaos How are we supposed to seek medical help if we think we are infected? I tried contacting the municipal hospital and they told me to come over. How am I supposed to go with no rickshaws or buses on the road? It is obvious they don’t know yet how essentials will be delivered..

Guys so where are you getting food from? Buses have been stopped and vegetable vendors dont come here anymore in delhi. Are stores still open? Appreciate the move of government but the government should also look for daily wagers, pours, disabled persons who need help from others like maids and should also provide PPE stock on time to the doctors because if they get infected, I don't know what's gonna happen.

And I also think this should be done a little earlier. [deleted] We should follow suit. Assumption train at its finest, you go bouy. Fuck man. Should have purchased more smokes. Good luck 21 days. Let's see. Am working more from home than i work from office. Wtf! I'm stuck in my hostel all alone till April 14th.
I should've gone home. For India's sake, I'm hoping this virus cannot survive higher temperatures, because along with social distancing, that would be quite useful in stopping the spread.

Because India can't afford a longer shutdown and certainly can't afford an uncontrolled pandemic. 😂 Anybody know what's going on with the exams?? Jee and stuff like that Is there any support going out for people who sustain entire families on daily wages and have lost their source of income? Will colleges reopen after the 21 day lockdown? My train is on 2nd April. So this lockdown means I have to cancel it? While I don’t agree with many policies of the Modi govt , the way Indian govt and the  bureaucracy has handled the corona pandemic has been remarkable. They learned lesson from other countries’ mistakes and acted swiftly. If coronavirus were to reach stage 3,there would be no way back for India Let's forget about all other issues and let's come together to beat this epidemic. As Modi said, Jaan hai toh jahaan hai. Follow social distancing friends and this too shall pass. Gobi: Damn I was itching to say something like this again after demo I called it first!

America don't have a world class healthcare system. They may have fancy equipments. But their health care system is corrupted. Oh ffs. I have been already living in lockdown for the past 7 months. Finally things were starting to get better and now this had to happen. I am about to have my examination in university. Will they too be postponed? Just don’t fucking dance At first he told them to drink cow piss and eat cow shit The only way to get through this lockdown is by asking kashmiris what they did to fill the time. Oh wait, but they didn’t had internet. My bad. Good emphasis on all the right points. Finally an on-point message and very well done! This is better than the shitty bang vessels messaging that we had last time. Turn off the internet and all communication and public transportation and make a curfew so people can get a taste of how Modi  attacked Kashmir. Why is such a big announcement made just 3½ hours prior to implementation?

Edit: add sentence [removed] [deleted] I am frankly appalled that people on here are cheering this. The economy of a nation where so many survive day to day cannot be shut down for three weeks. More people will die than due to the virus but Modi will consolidate power because ""he did something"". I hope to god I'm wrong. [deleted] Fucking eh!
Great job India!
Way to show solid leadership. Their is no plan. Remember demonitisation. He changed conditions willy-nilly,without a whit of care who got caught in crossfire. He played emotions of people,projecting so many dreams. The poor and middle class paid the price for his maniacal whims. The rich and truly corrupt coasted away with ease. It's happening again. The idiots are again falling for his passionate family member act.




This 21 days are going to be death knoll for small business,daily wage earners etc. And I don't trust shit about their arrangements. The social media is already rife with post praising cops for bashing people without even asking them why they are outside. I saw news report yesterday in which cops thrashed a fruit stall owner like beast for opening his kiosk. No education no dialogue, just beatings. This is the plan. The poor when forced out due to needs will be tagged by goons wearing facade of vigilance. 





Why are these affluent culprit who truly brought the virus to country going to decide what is essential and what's not? Is it safe to have a quick run on the streets early in the morning? I live in a sparsely populated area and people only start coming out around 7. Fucking idiot. That's not how you should do lockdown announcement. People panicking, overcrowded markets, everything could have been avoided if he had given more buffer time. I don't even have cigarettes ffs [deleted] Bhenchod sutte laane padenge. This is a mendatory step to be taken by the Government. Italy is in the 2nd position in terms of medical facilities and India far behind from them. After seeing Italy's condition, We should support our PM and we just need to be at home for our safety only. If you love your and your family's lives, Please stay at home! We need to fight this battle together. Good luck with this. Have you been to India?  Social distancing is impossible! Make sure to explain to all friends and relatives what social distancing actually means. In the UK, this being a new and conceptual phrase, it hasn’t really landed. Explain it in basic, relatable terms. Only going out for essentials, at most once a week. One form of exercise a day, either alone or with people you share a house with. 

Social distancing is a new concept and while people are hearing it and reading it, a lot of people are not really internalising it. At last they have taken right action. I’m dying of boredom So far so good! Announcing a Lockdown shows leadership but the real test is managing skills. 21 days of managing law and order, the supply chain of necessary products and services in the light of the crashing economy and daily earners having no way to earn and feed, it will be a real testing time for India and Modi. We support the lockdown. It's for our betterment to stay safe and live healthy life. This is a test of human capacity and capability to do what’s right. Mister Changa si Do Lobe 8 p.m. #Take the pooo to the looo 🎵🎵 1.3 billion Indians on lockdown. Guess what they're gonna be doing.

Yup. Reproducing. It's what Indians do best. Think of all that time freed up for unholy amounts of unprotected genital bashing. Expect maternity wards to be overwhelmed in 40 weeks. I am filled with so much rage at the moment. Does that mean there’s to be no change to activities in Kashmir? So all the liquor shops will be closed for three weeks? What about alcoholics who could actually die from withdrawals? India is literally the last place I think will take a lockdown seriously. Hygiene there is extremely poor. >Italy and America have world-class facilities still they were not able to stop it from spreading.


I, as an Indian in America- HAHAHAHAHA. World class facilities. LOL
The morons here are worried about their net worth more than what happens to people. There's still not much going on at the federal level. Indian govt is handling this better. (Indian people probably aren't). Here neither are handling it better. [deleted] This is a good start.

I hope more details follow on 

1.  how food/necessities can be distributed to walled-up-people.
2.  Support for people who would lose income
3.  Tax relief to people & industries
4. Charges which would be put on people who do not follow the lockdown.
5. what exactly is locked down, what will remain open.

there are more. [deleted] India is a dirty ass country, lockdown won’t do shit for them. Lockdown hi hai . curfew nhin. It was said in a way that uneducated population understands it to be a curfew. Assholes. Just finished my last bottle of booze(it was a Frateli) and had some chicken today. Enjoyed both a lot.

Kal se can band, cave & ration life shuru People buying ration as if the lockdown is for 21 months. People find lockdown as an excuse to eat like pigs. Modi modi modi modi I AM FUCKING PROUD TO BE AN INDIAN TODAY"
843,Food,"Corona Virus can not be transmitted via cooked food, source linked in comments.",https://i.redd.it/rqt8n5khh3n41.jpg,," Upvoted.

A friend shared a tweet saying that animals caused Corona, and other diseases like HIV. They captioned it saying that none of this would have happened if the world was vegan. I'm like uh.... That's not how any of this works. https://www.fsai.ie/faq/coronavirus.html Viruses are not living, neither can they be dead. Terms like being killed wont apply to them. They should use terms like activated or primed and deactivated instead. 

Maybe the heat or dryness interferes with their ability to infect, denaturing viral surface proteins necessary for invasion into host cells. (all conjecture obviously)


I am most fascinated by the jumping genes/McClintock story I don't understand? If I have Covid-19 inside me, and I cook food (obviously there is a chance that I will breath on the food somehow), can I not temporarily put some strain on the food, which once eaten can pass the virus. In that way, is food not a vector (even if temporary)?? If it can pass through surfaces an infected person has touched why not food?"
844,Food,Is there an equivalent to Ayurveda's concept of Hot and Cold food in Western Medicine?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fszdnk/is_there_an_equivalent_to_ayurvedas_concept_of/,"I am not talking about food temperature but the Ayurvedic belief that some foods increase the body's internal heat and some cool it down.

For example, stuff like Chicken, Root vegetables are thought to heat up the body while Tender coconut, banana etc will cool it down.

The belief is very prevalent in Indian households and widely followed. Does Western medicine have anything similar to this?

This [article](https://food.ndtv.com/food-drinks/the-ayurvedic-principle-of-foods-that-heat-up-and-cool-your-body-1721919) give a good introduction to the topic."," It's not western medicine, it's just medicine. Everything else is alternative medicine. Western Medicine does not work on 'belief'. It has to be clinically & experimentally tried & proven.

Hot/Cold food is just pure BS peuso science & without any logical explanation on 'why & how'. 

Bit like homeopathy its just existing due to ignorance & desperation of people. This concept is there in Chinese medicine (yin and yang) no idea about Western medicine Alkaline diet is somewhat  similar. It claims That the foods we eat somehow disturb the balance of the body. >For example, stuff like Chicken, Root vegetables are thought to heat up the body while Tender coconut, banana etc will cool it down.

This is a stupid concept and deserves to be in the dustbin of ""knowledge"". We indians venerate the old too much. I have heard this a lot too. My mom doesn't allow us to eat khichuri at night in summer because apparently it is 'garam', while she doesn't allow us to eat bananas, etc in winter because its 'thanda'.

TBH, it's hard to define the 'Indian' aspect in this. Everyone is relating to this 'Indian' in their own way. 


Consider it a placeholder.


Some replace it with cheap, some with thief, some as shallow. It's what they want to see, their biases.


It's not the act of stealing or getting fired, it's the act of doing something that goes against the common held belief (eg, why does a well paid guy have to steal?), that makes it Induan. 


The disproportionate risk we Indians like to take (eg, stake whole life to clear IAS, which is very unlikely) - this poor guy didn't need to steal, that's what gets people.


You know, it's all in how you perceive it. 


If you want a thought experiment about 'Indian' try replacing the 'well paid banker' aspect of this act with 'poor'. How do you think the comments of this thread would've changed had the act been committed by a poor Indian.

849,Food,"Drinking hot water, avoiding cold foods - prep for the virus",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fpc6tw/drinking_hot_water_avoiding_cold_foods_prep_for/,"This is a question for the doctors of this subreddit or anyone who can answer it with any kind of authority. Personal anecdotes won't really help me much.

So every Indian parent has always been a strong advocate of drinking warm water or hot water and all kinds of other shit like milk with turmeric or gargling regularly even before the virus. But now they have more ammunition. Now you have to do these things if you want to beat the virus. I also want to include vitamin C tablets to the purview of this question as ""they boost immunity"". 

I'm not going to argue against whatever health benefits these things might have normally. I'm sure they're great. But my dad has a whatsapp recording of some guy who has a friend in China (idfk as if that claim makes the recording more authentic) where the guy goes through a list of things to help you prep against the virus. 

He makes a case for how warm water doesn't let mucus collect and takes it to your stomach where gastric acids deal w it. And says to avoid cold foods during these times. Alnd take vit C. And gargle regularly.

I guess my question how exactly do these things help against the virus, if at all?  And if they don't how do I convince my parents to calm down?

I also want to add the reason for my cynicism is I've heard doctors say that you can try supplements for improving immunity but nothing can really help you from getting the virus. And don't cold foods only worsen the symptoms of an existing cold virus instead of causing it? No one is implying eating ice cream will give you corona but their implication is that eating cold foods will make you weak against corona. I hope I can get a definite answer out of this that I can carry around for the rest of my life."," >drinking warm water or hot water

This is a myth. we are warm blooded animal.(Homeostasis) 

>milk with turmeric

turmeric has anti microbial property .

>About gargling.

Gargling works on a simple phenomenon i.e plasmolysis but do remember to add salt..otherwise gargling is useless.

>Vit C

Yes its good for immunity. But regular and gradual intake of VIt C helps in enhancing immunity. My dad isn't letting me keep water in the fridge.

Fuck these stupid fucking retarded ass WhatsApp forwards If digesting mucous by gastric juices could cure covid-19, then mucolytics would have been the first line therapy...


Nebuliser and mucolytics, bam SARS-CoV-2. Why not look at fact checking sites or reputable media sites before asking for verification of putrid WhatsApp claims? Each of these have been debunked multiple times.

Failing that, listen to the PM. This is not a time for home remedies.

(And this BS about cold foods is irritating. Common cold and influenza are caused by coronaviruses, which don’t give a s**t about what you’ve eaten. Dairy, though, can thicken your mucus which can cause problems when you have a cold.)

Edited: although the thickening effect is called out as false in many scientific papers, which point to an allergenic effect instead."

1. In Karnataka, tonnes of grapes have found their way to compost pits amounting to hundreds of crores of rupees.
2. Next week the harvest season will begin for India’s most staple wheat crop. In all probability, shortage of hands for harvesting wheat could lead to rotting of the crop in the fields. 
3. In France, acute shortage of seasonal labour to harvest crops has prompted the government call unemployed to help farmers.
4. In the US, the virus has sent farm workers, half of whom are undocumented migrant labourers, uncovered by $2 trillion stimulus, into panic

The government has so far given a welfare relief of only Rs 1.7 lakh crore, which is just about 1.2% of GDP and that too largely for formal sector workers. The informal sector, which constitutes about 80% of the country’s workforce,  is yet to get any relief

Yup milk is a cheap source of nutrition for kids and I wont contest that but its worth noting that Kids don't have to drink milk. Its a good source of calcium, vitamin D & some amount of protein but other food sources provide these nutrients substantially.

Milk alone cannot fulfill daily requirements for either of those. Especially protein.

What does it tastes like? Does it deserve it's reputation?"," It tastes good. Not that bad. Personally, I like it well enough. I think it's something of a self-fulfilling prophecy where you're told it tastes disgusting in childhood (because of its reputation as poor-people food, sick-people food and, well, horse feed) and that ends up influencing your experience. Similar to broccoli in the west. I know exactly what he's talking about. I sprout mung beans on a damp paper towel in my desk drawer. Very nutritious, but they smell like death.

On a serious note, [you can make a *Rasam* \(a stew/soup that is eaten with rice\), and a *Palya* \(a sauteed vegetable dish\) out of it.](http://foodandremedy.com/recipes/side-dishes/sprouted-horsegram-rasam/) These are quite tasty!

p.s. I know horse gram and moong beans are different things. Its bitter in taste, 
I always squeeze lemon and put some salt.

Where you at? You can buy online though. Horse-gram is a very healthy lentil. The taste is a bit bitter but it goes well with spiced rice. It makes a good porridge and all healthy food doesn't taste good isn't it? I really like it. My mom makes Dal with it with tamarind. I had to Google what horse gram is. Never heard of it in my life."
871,Food,Top of the food chain? Think again.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fkens9/top_of_the_food_chain_think_again/,"It only takes a small nanometer dimensioned entity to bring the entire human race to a halt. Whatever happened to WE the pioneers. Imagine, this was going to be the year in which we were going to put ideas like autonomous cars, flying cars, space tourism, asteroid mining, hyper-looping etc in action. Now, we are rushing to the grocery stores and fighting over trivial things like paper to wipe our backs. 

There is a quote in the movie Interstellar:

*”We’ve always defined ourselves by the ability to overcome the impossible. And we count these moments. These moments when we dare to aim higher, to break barriers, to reach for the stars, to make the unknown known. We count these moments as our proudest achievements. But we lost all that.
Or perhaps we’ve just forgotten that we are still pioneers. And we’ve barely begun. And that our greatest accomplishments cannot be behind us, because our destiny lies above us”*

It almost feels like that our systems, our unity, our spirit, our patience and our human sensitivities are all getting tested at the same time. The Hope that there is another tomorrow keeps us all moving and fighting. 

It however goes without saying the C-scare has truly shown the fragility of our existence. We need to pause. We need to think what is truly important. We need to focus. It is time to rethink. We have not found another worlds. We have not found a way to escape yet. 

This is it. Let’s push this out and remember to not go back to our arrogant ignorant selves. Else, we will waste a perfect disaster to evolve as Humans first.

We will survive this. However, why waste an adversity. Let’s use it to change the course of future."," Humans are like a parasite on the planet which has multiplied very rapidly and is destroying the planet everyday by consuming the resources unsustainably, wiping out forests, species and polluting the ecosystem. Every attempt by nature to wipe out this parasite has failed till now, as we have won every such war and we will win this one as well. We will continue the destruction, and no one can stop us.. Past pandemics have killed more humans in one wave, that coronavirus could ever kill in its entire duration. We have better quality of life and better immune system now, no longer susceptible to other diseases like measles, small pox etc. We'll fare much better.


And the struggle is right now to save as many as possible. Including the sick and elderly too. If we need have to care for them, we could simply go ahead, let a few million people die and pick up the pace as if nothing happened. We are literally at the top of the food chain because we're trying to defy mother nature, now more than ever by saving even those who are deemed unworthy of survival in the process of natural selection. Our economy or finances may take a hit but human race will go on. Many will die, but human race will continue to exist Doomers out here really thinking that COVID-19 can wipe out humans Trying to eat mutant infested food started this shit show. Would rather not care for being top of the food chain that way."
872,Food,What food can I stock up?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fjik30/what_food_can_i_stock_up/,"I live in hostel. The college is already closed. I want to stock up some food in case of emergency if Zomato/Swiggy is not available.

I was thinking some biscuits, chips. Any other suggestions?"," You'd probably want food heavy in nutritious value and sustainable. While certain biscuits do the trick, I don't think chips is the right call. 
Even Instant Noodles for that matter. Yes they're easy to make but Sodium will suck the Oxygen out of you and in case of a lockdown you may or may not want to open windows for cross ventilation.

If everything goes to shit sticks, Get a small stove some utensils and basic ration like rice, wheat so on and so forth. 

Until then High Fibre Bisuits, Dairy Products ( Cheese Slices are really useful they have enough nutrific value not a lot but enough ),protien bars/chocolate bars with nuts, and may sound contradictory but lots of chips because the amount of free time you'll have something to munch on will help pass time and deal with anxiety if it pops up. Buy rice and daal salt and some pickle, if possible find a kettle. It'll take some time but I think you can make daal rice and eat it with pickle worst case scenario. Soak the rice and daal in water for like an hour to reduce the cooking time. Good luck bud r/eatcheapandhealthy Just some options.

Juice, rice, beans, potatoes, cheese, soymilk or milk powder, Maggi. Stock up on some milk cartons, and a box or two of breakfast cereal.   
Juice cartons, and longer lasting fruits like apples.   
And some ready-to-eat meals maybe- like MTR instant poha & Upma. They also have meals like sambar rice, chana masala, etc. which don't taste that great, tbh, but are a good contingency plan.   


Then your snacks like fibre biscuits, and maggi, cuppa noodles. Maybe some dark chocolate.  
If you can get your hand on Indian snacks like mathri & Khakra, that would be great.   


Stay safe :) Bro food n all is upto you but do get some multivitamin tabs n calcium powers from a pharmacy, they will boost your immunity n reduces the risk of minor infections"

It's for us to decide what we want to eat , not others I am atheist, i eat whatever i want. **Rig Ved**

Mandal 10, Sukt 68

1-12 (or 3 to 12)

It talks about beef eating (both male and female, bull/cow). In special occasions or in rituals the female/the cow was slaughtered.

Beef eating was very common in ancient times, specially when a guest comes to your house. It was so common that some times *atithi* (guest) was instead referred as *'Gau-ghna'* means 'Killer of cow'.

Furthermore, lord indra was fan of oxen, he demanded 15-20 at a time so that both of his cheeks can be full. 

RSS/Hindutva != hinduism. Given the religious nature of food and association with cow in UP, I refuse to eat palak paneer in UP. You never know if it's palak. Your food is their mummy. /s Food itself is a religion and all humans love that. Bjp rats sell and eat beef themselves. Cow or Beef is only an excuse to lynch muslims. Period. That's not really true. Muslims and conservative Hindus do have taboos with respect to different kinds of foods. But it's mostly a private affair. We don't enforce our personal restrictions on others.

Also, lets not be too naive about this affair near Makara Sankranti or Amit Shah's [vaman jayanti](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/amit-shahs-vamana-jayanti-tweet-sparks-a-row-on-onam-eve/articleshow/54319937.cms?from=mdr) wishes on Onam. These are the kinds of third-rate spitting matches that India's internal discourse has come down to. Wish someone from Kerala was our PM. Words sir words 👌👌👌👌 Absolutely true. Many people across India enjoy beef and other meats as auspicious. The cowbangers oh so favourite Kashmiri pandits eat beef regularly. These cheapos who can't even sing the national song or name all the Vedas are out to use my religion as a stick to harass minorities Can confirm. It's quite common for Malayalee Hindus to eat beef. Pork sales? Not true at all"

Too many incoming stories right now from friends, relatives, parents who live by themselves, etc and of their plight of not able to go and buy anything. I understand its because of a sudden surge in demand, but I feel helpless. Can anyone shed some light on some of the measures that are ongoing to mitigate this?"," [deleted] In Goa swiggy and Zomato have both stopped due to all restaurants closed There's a limit to how much people can panic buy.
If transportation of goods is not stopped, prices would normalise in a few days.

Considering the fact that there's no actual shortage, the main problem lies in not being able to go out and get stuff."
